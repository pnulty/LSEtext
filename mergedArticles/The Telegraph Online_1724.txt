Join Tim Stanley, Benedict Brogan, Louise Mensch and Dominic Raab discuss why conservative voters won't give David Cameron a break?
The British economy is growing faster than that of any G7 country, the cost of living crisis is over, Ukip are tearing themselves apart and David Cameron's trump card – a referendum on EU membership in 2017 – is on the table.
Why, then, are the Eurosceptics still flocking to Farage and preparing to humiliate the Tories in next month's European elections?
Tim Stanley and Benedict Brogan discuss this with top Tories Louise Mensch in New York and Dominic Raab, the outspoken MP who made headlines with his amendment to the Government's immigration bill earlier in the year.
This was a live event from April 17 at 1200, join us again next week for #HangWithTim at 1300 GMT.
