DANGEROUS criminals could be flooding into Britain “without the knowledge" of Home Office officials, a damning report claimed last night.
The lack of full entry and exit checks meant the country’s borders were “under policed", MPs said.
The Home Affairs Select Committee called for far tougher action - and co-operation agreement with other countries.
Just last month, an Albanian illegal immigrant deported three times was jailed AGAIN for possessing nearly £27,000 of cocaine.
The Committee said: “There is a real possibility that dangerous criminals may have been able to enter the UK without the knowledge of the authorities."
The Government was also panned for the “unnecessary anti-immigrant prejudice" against Bulgarians and Romanians earlier this year.
Committee chair Keith Vaz MP said the failure to commission an accurate estimate of the number of migrants that may come to the UK triggered damaging speculation, he said.
He added: “The numbers coming from Bulgaria and Romania since the end of transitional controls appear rather more a trickle than a flood."
A Home Office spokesman said the country was building an immigration system that was “fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants".
