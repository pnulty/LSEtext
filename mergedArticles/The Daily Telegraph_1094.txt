The £1.5million that Ukip spent on its European election poster campaign can hardly be said to have been money well spent. An "immigrant" who was photographed begging in the street turned out to be from Dublin, and a woman who was portrayed as an ordinary "voter" was unmasked as an aide to Nigel Farage, the party's leader.
Still, it looks as if there is a lot more fun and games to come as Paul Sykes, the party's principal donor and one of the wealthiest men in the country with a fortune that was once put at £650million, has just seen his fortunes rocket.
The latest accounts for High–stone Group – his key company – show that it had £253million sitting on its books as at March 31 2013 – a big increase on the £197million it held in 2012.
The 70–year–old Yorkshire–born businessman and property developer has promised to do "whatever it takes" to help Ukip in the European elections.
Last month, it was disclosed that Sykes, pictured, owned a luxurious apartment complex in Leeds city centre which employed Polish, Lithuanian and Portuguese workers. Sykes said he had been unaware that foreigners were working at the property and denied they had been employed because they were cheaper than British workers.
Sykes said Ukip wanted "controlled immigration", rather than a complete halt to all labour movement across the EU. He warned that in Yorkshire "these people are just pouring in for reasons only they know and this unlimited immigration is going to end in catastrophe".
