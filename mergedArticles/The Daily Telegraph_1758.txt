ACCORDING to many a recent expert barometer, the strengthening pound is dampening orders from the Far East for British products.
But yesterday the UK received some unexpected praise from a friendly Asian financier.
Stephen Jen, of hedge fund SLJ Macro Partners, noted in his morning email: "I have often waited in long lines to go through immigration at airports. On more than one occasion, I witnessed British Airways pilots waiting for all of their crew to go through immigration first before they themselves did." According to Jen this is not the case among Asian airlines.
He also gave the UK's technology industry the thumbs–up, saying: "I've always thought that the UK's technological know–how and scientific achievements are under–rated, partly because of the self–deprecating nature of the media here."
That's the spirit on St George's Day.
