Ukip's spokesman on small business has been accused of hypocrisy after his restaurant employed seven illegal immigrants last year.
Ukip have regularly attacked the government for allowing "huge" numbers of foreign workers into the UK and failing to put "the British people first".
However, Zouk Tea Bar and Grill in Manchester, which Amjad Bashir, 61, set up with his two sons, Tayub and Mudassar, was raided by immigration officers on June 1, 2013.
Three days later, Mr Bashir resigned as a director of the company which owns the restaurant and a sister branch in Bradford. He remains a major shareholder and has continued to take a role in the running of the restaurant.
Mr Bashir, who has also been described by Nigel Farage as Ukip's immigration spokesman, is likely to be elected as an MEP in next week's European poll. He shared the stage with Mr Farage in Sheffield last month as the party launched a poster campaign depicting an unemployed British worker "hit hard by unlimited foreign labour".
A Home Office spokeswoman confirmed that seven people were arrested "for a variety of immigration offences" and a civil penalty notice was served after the raid.
The civil penalty notice carries a maximum fine of £70,000, although it is unclear what sum was levied. One of Mr Bashir's sons, Tayub, said that they were appealing against the notice and had not yet paid a fine. He said the restaurant conducted immigration checks on all staff and denied any wrongdoing.
Edward McMillan-Scott, the Lib Dem MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, said: "Not only are Ukip whipping up ill-feeling towards immigrants, they are supporting a man who has made money off the back of illegal workers."
