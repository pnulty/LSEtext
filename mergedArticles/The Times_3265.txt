Ten foreign national offenders have served more than five years in jail beyond the end of their sentence, according to Home Office figures.
About 850 inmates have spent from less than one month to more than 60 months waiting to be deported.
The statistics were released in response to a question from Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, who asked for a breakdown of the number of foreign nationals in prison awaiting deportation after the end of their sentence.
In response, James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, said: "We make every effort to ensure that a person's removal by deportation coincides, as far as possible, with his or her release from prison on completion of sentence. Where a detainee refuses to co-operate with the process, detention may be prolonged."
