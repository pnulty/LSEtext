ALMOST 1,000 foreign prisoners are being held in British jails after the end of their sentence because authorities cannot deport them.
Many of the foreign offenders, who include rapists, paedophiles and murderers, use human rights laws to fight against deportation and remain in Britain costing taxpayers up to £34million a year.
Earlier this year, David Cameron refused to support an amendment by the Tory backbencher Dominic Raab to ban foreign prisoners from using Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, which gives them the right to family life, to remain in the UK.
The figures, published in a parliamentary answer, show that 10 foreign offenders have been held for more than five years longer than their sentences. A total of 35 have remained in jail for between two and five years, 100 for between one and two years and 705 for a year or less.
The Government is introducing legislation which will mean that criminals are deported first and that their appeals are then heard abroad to end the "neverending game of snakes and ladders" under the current immigration system.
The Conservatives are also expected to pledge to scrap the Human Rights Act in its manifesto for the 2015 election and replace it with a British bill of rights.
Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary who obtained the figures, said: "British jails are seriously overcrowded and rammed to overflowing. Yet 850 foreign criminals who could be deported are clogging up prisons because of this Government's incompetence."
