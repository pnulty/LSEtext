BRITAIN’S jails are clogged up with foreign criminals at a cost to taxpayers of hundreds of millions of pounds because of the Government’s “frustratingly poor” record on deporting them.
In a scathing report published today MPs said overseas inmates consistently account for one in seven of all serving convicts because immigration officials fail to kick existing crooks out quicker than new ones are sent down.
Shockingly the deportation rate plummeted by 18 per cent over three years, the Public Accounts Committee revealed.
MPs on the committee also slammed failing rehabilitation programmes designed to stop ex-prisoners re-offending.
In a report into the country’s 130 prisons, the committee found that about 11,000 of the total 84,000 prisoners were from overseas costing the UK £300million a year.
Home Office officials told MPs they did not have a target for removing the unwanted convicts but deported more than 4,500 a year.
Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: “Performance in reducing the number of foreign national prisoners continues to be frustratingly poor, costing the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds.” She called on the National Offender Management Service to work with the Home Office to “tackle the barriers to their removal and take all steps to improve performance in this area”.
Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: “The foreign national prisoner population is lower than it was in 2010 and reducing it further is a top priority.
“We have increased the numbers removed through the Early Removal Scheme and the introduction of the Tariff Expired Removal Scheme. We are also working closely with the Home Office to ensure removal processes are as efficient as possible.”
