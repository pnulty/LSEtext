British branches of foreign banks that take deposits from immigrant communities are facing the brunt of a regulatory crackdown that will be announced today.
Lenders outside the European Econ-omic Area that offer current or savings accounts are being warned that they need to change their structures radically or stop taking deposits.
The Bank of England's Prudential Regulatory Authority says that they will not be able to continue trading in their present form unless there is "a very high level of assurance" from the regulator in their home country.
In most cases, that is expected to lead to them being forced into a costly restructuring, creating a subsidiary in the UK — a legally separate entity with its own ring-fenced capital and liquidity and a robust board, and one reporting to UK regulators.
Bank of India and State Bank of India are two groups thought likely to be caught by the new rules. Each has a string of local branches serving communities originally from the subcontinent, such as in Southall in West London and Leicester.
Britain has licensed 49 branches from outside the EEA to take deposits. Four have a deposit base of more than £500million and 25 have deposits of more than £100 million.
The PRA wants to minimise the chances of Britain having to pick up the tab if the parent bank of a UK branch fails.
