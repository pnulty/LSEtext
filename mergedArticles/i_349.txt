A landmark discovery has shed new light on the origins of life in Britain - with archaeologists confident they finally know the identity of the country's oldest town.
It had long been believed that Thatcham in Buckinghamshire was the oldest continuous settlement in the UK. But researchers believe picturesque Amesbury, which is 40 miles west and home to Stonehenge, in fact holds the distinction of being the birthplace of history in Britain - an honour confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records.
They say the new findings dismiss previous theories that the Wiltshire town was conceived by European immigrants. Instead, relics uncovered point to British colonists being behind the settlement, which dates back to more than 10 millennia.
David Jacques, research fellow in archaeology at the University of Buckingham, who led the dig, said: "The site blows the lid off the Neolithic Revolution (deemed the first agricultural revolution in Middle Eastern history) in a number of ways. It provides evidence for people staying put, clearing land, building and presumably worshipping monuments. "For years people have been asking 'why is Stonehenge where it is?' Now, at last, we have found the answers."
Carbon dating of auroch bones from an archaeological dig carried out by the university shows that Amesbury has been continually occupied for every millennia since 8,820BC. The dig took place at Vespasian's Camp, Blick Mead, a mile-and-a-half from Stonehenge.
During a six-week dig, 31,000 flints were discovered in a 16sqm area and more than 2,000 were found in 1sqm - the largest concentration of such finds in Europe.
