THE impact of a decade of EU–fuelled migration on Britain's regions has been revealed.
Figures show the areas where more than 2.3 million Eastern European migrants have settled since 2002.
Britain's 1.2 million Polish immigrants live mainly in north London, Edinburgh and Birmingham, while Lithuanians head for East Anglia and Slovaks to northern cities.
While the Welsh border attracts Romanians and Bulgarians, Manchester has become home to the UK's biggest Czech community.
The Government figures yesterday prompted fury at years of EU migration.
Ukip's Tim Aker said: "These astonishingly high numbers show how both Labour and the Conservatives have given away control of our borders.
"It's time we left the EU to retake control of our borders so we can have a properly managed immigration system, as opposed to the free–for–all we have now."
Department of Work and Pensions records show 229,000 National Insurance numbers were given to Eastern Europeans in 2013 – higher than any other year since 2008. The figures do not cover criminals, who do not intend to pay tax.
The UK is a magnet for migrants because of its job opportunities and the soft–touch benefits system.
Outside of London boroughs like Ealing, Brent and Haringey, 25,000 Poles live in Edinburgh, 19,000 in Birmingham and 16,000 have gathered in Luton.
The second largest group, at 256,000, Lithuanians can be found in the agricultural areas of Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire.
Slovaks have congregated in Bradford, Sheffield and Derby, while Manchester now has 3,000 Czechs.
Herefordshire is favoured by Romanians and Bulgarians.
However, the figures do not include the huge influx from the two states since January, when visa restrictions on them were dropped.
