Up to one in three UK voters are expected to back Ukip in this week's European elections in what would mark a historic moment for the anti-Brussels party, writes Jim Pickard .
All voters will have the chance to vote for their regional European Parliament member on the same day that the local council elections take place.
In the last set of European polls in 2009, the UK Independence party came second with 16.5 per cent of the vote, more than 10 percentage points behind the Conservatives.
If the party leapfrogs the Tories, it will be a dilemma for David Cameron, who is facing a political insurgency from the right. The Tory prime minister has already shifted his stance - on immigration, the EU and welfare - in an attempt to fend off the rise of Ukip.
But Nigel Farage , Ukip leader, will seek to press home his advantage when the results come in next weekend by calling on Mr Cameron to give the public a vote on leaving the EU. Mr Farage wants an EU referendum as soon as possible, but Mr Cameron wants to offer it in 2017.
The leaders of the three main parties will face internal pressures if they perform badly. The Liberal Democrats, who have 12 European Parliament members, are projected to lose the majority of their Brussels seats, if the polls are accurate, reopening fissures within the party.
Labour needs a strong result to soothe jitters after the Tories drew level with them in opinion polls.
