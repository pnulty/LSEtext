THE growing popularity of Britain as a haven for economic migrants has been exposed in fi gures showing the lives of almost 400,000 foreign–born residents are funded by the taxpayer.
The latest Home Office statistics reveal that there were 397,000 non–UK nationals receiving handouts in February 2013 – a rise of nearly 110,000 from 288,720 in the five years since 2008.
But the true number could be even greater as the details are not yet available for the past 12 months. Ukip spokesman Tim Aker said: "This shows the Government has virtually no control over our borders.
"It shows how broken our migration system is – and the longer this is allowed to go on the more chaotic the situation will get.
"We need to be outside the EU in order to have full control over our borders so we know who is in the UK and who is deserving of benefi ts and not."
It was revealed last week net UK migration rose to 212,000 in the year to September 2013, pushing it further away from Prime Minister David Cameron's target of below 100,000 by 2015.
The net fl ow – the numbers moving to the UK minus those leaving – soared from 154,000 the previous year. The increase was driven by a huge growth in the number of EU citizens fl ocking to Britain.
There are now 5.6 million claiming working–age handouts in Britain – roughly 16.5 per cent of the 33.6 million working population.
Individuals need to supply a National Insurance number when making a claim or starting a job. Department for Work and Pensions fi gures show NI registrations to adult overseas nationals entering the UK has nearly doubled in a decade.
In 2002 there were 311,288 but that fi gure jumped to 617,237 in 2013. Those coming here from within the EU and demanding an NI number totalled 385,000 in 2012/13 – a 10 per cent increase on the previous year. Leading the way were people from Poland but almost 18,000 Romanians arrived too.
Britain's soft–touch reputation for benefi ts meant, as of February last year, 31 per cent of claimants who were non–UK nationals when fi rst registering for a NI number were from within the EU, including 15 per cent from accession countries. Of the rest, 32 per cent were from Asia and the Middle East with 24 per cent from Africa.
EU migrants account for 25 per cent of all non–UK nationals claiming Jobseeker's Allowance.
Opponents of unrestricted immigration from within the EU have said that severe strain is being placed on frontline public services as a result.
Harrow, in north–west London, is already home to 5,000 Romanians but experts think there is an "underground" population of 1,000 living in 319 illegal "beds–in–sheds" accommodation across the borough.
Yet a Home Offi ce spokesman claimed its policy of controlling immigration was on track.
He added: "Our reforms have cut non–EU migration to its lowest level since 1998. There are now 82,000 fewer people arriving annually from outside the EU than when this government came to power. Overall fi gures are also well down from when we came to government in 2010 with nearly 70,000 fewer migrants coming to the UK.
"The Government is ensuring controls on accessing benefi ts and services, including the NHS and social housing, are among the tightest in Europe."
