Sir John: Tories are people's party
SIR John Major will today declare the Conservatives are the true party for working class Brits in a bid to get rid of its toff image. After years of class attacks on old Etonian leader David Cameron, Brixton boy Sir John has been picked as frontman for a new Tory push to win over ordinary people. The 1990s leader will insist only Tories really understand the Brit drive to get on in life. In a speech at the party's new central London HQ, the ex-PM will hail millions of people in the UK who "have similar hopes and aspirations as I did". He will say: "I left school at 16, not because I wanted to stop studying, but because my family needed the money. "I worked during the day, studied at night and joined a political party which would help give me a step up in life, rather than a hand out: the Conservative Party. "It was the values promoted by the Conservative Party that created the opportunities for me, a boy from Brixton, to become Prime Minister." Sir John will also launch a new apprenticeship scheme for people who have not been to university. Tory insiders say his speech will be the first of several in the run-up to polling day next year. They hope to recreate the party's success in 1992 when he overturned Labour's big poll lead to win a record 14 million votes. During that campaign one Tory poster read: "What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister." Party chiefs also want to contrast Sir John with ex-Labour PMs Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, who have not publicly backed Ed Miliband. His return to the Westminster frontline comes a day after Tory MP Rob Halfon called for the party to be renamed the Workers Party.
