EU influx doubles in 1yr Merkel's reform blow
A NET influx of 212,000 migrants poured into Britain last year — casting a huge shadow over David Cameron's EU reform talks with Angela Merkel.
Net migration from other EU nations alone DOUBLED in the year to September to a record 131,000, new figures yesterday revealed. It took the total number of arriving Europeans to a massive 209,000 — up from 149,000 in 2012 — while only 78,000 Brits and foreigners left. The highest increases were from troubled Spain, Italy, Portugal and Poland — as well as Romania and Bulgaria BEFORE migration controls were scrapped last month.
The stats deepen the huge scale of the PM's task to win back powers from Brussels for Britain to control its own borders.
Brits see that as key to his pledged renegotiation — or they will vote to leave the EU in his 2017 EU referendum. But on a visit to London yesterday, the German Chancellor snuffed out Mr Cameron's hopes of "fundamental reform".
Referring to changehungry Tories, Mrs Merkel told a special gathering of MPs and peers: "They are in for a disappointment."
She was given the rare honour of addressing Parliamentarians in the House of Lords' Royal Gallery.
Mrs Merkel admitted there had been "mistakes" over freedom of movement in the EU. And she said a deal to keep Britain in was possible. Mr Cameron said changes were still "possible, achievable and do-able". Home Office officials admitted they were powerless to stop the new influx of EU immigrants but pointed to success with tougher controls on non-EU new arrivals, down by 25,000 last year.
