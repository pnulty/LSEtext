ONE of the great debates over immigration centres around the issue of how much European migrants contribute to Britain in terms of how much tax they pay, and how much they actually take from the system in benefits.
Research from think tank Migration Watch has found that immigrants who work for the minimum wage make "virtually no net contribution" as they pay very little tax but receive - especially if they are a couple or a family - a substantial amount in credits and benefits. For instance, 150,000 employees from Eastern Europe pay only about Â£1 a week in net tax, while some pay nothing at all.
Says Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch: "This analysis shows simply that the taxpayer is subsidising their wages." Case closed.
