RESEARCH by the pressure group MigrationWatch has predicted that 500,000 immigrants will arrive here from the EU over the next five years which is bad news for David Cameron who promised to lower immigration levels to the “tens of thousands” by the 2015 election.
To its credit the Government has actually managed to drive down the number of immigrants coming to this country from outside the EU, because we still have the right to prevent those people from entering.
But this notable achievement has been massively outweighed by the sheer scale of the influx from Europe which doubled in 2013 and MigrationWatch predicts that the “large flow” of migrants from Eastern Europe will continue for some time.
As Sir Andrew Green correctly says: “It was crazy to have opened up our labour market and our benefit system to one hundred million people from countries with a standard of living less than a quarter of our own.”
In Spain, Italy and Portugal high levels of youth unemployment will also prompt many nationals to come here in search of work.
The fact is that until we leave the EU we will never get a grip on immigration.

Medics must speak English
LAST year it was found that more than 25,000 doctors from the EU had registered with the NHS without having their language skills checked. 
Under new proposals from the Law Commission, the health care regulators will have new powers to make sure that those who cannot speak English face being disciplined or struck off.
Patients must be able to place their trust in doctors and that becomes almost impossible if the doctor’s language skills are not adequate.
It can also be a matter of life or death as was evident in the case of Daniel Ubani. 
In 2008 Ubani, a Nigerian-born German doctor who had failed an English language test, accidentally gave a 70-year-old man a lethal dose of painkillers.
The Government should implement these proposals as quickly as possible.

Slow down in our cities
A REPORT by the charity group Brake has found that almost eight out of 10 Britons support the implementation of a blanket 20mph speed limit in towns and cities.
Since 20mph limits were imposed in the north London borough of Camden accidents have fallen by 54 per cent.
However, it is entirely possible that few motorists would even notice the difference. With modern traffic levels being what they are, cars rarely reach that speed anyway.
