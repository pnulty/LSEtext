Least surprising news of the week is that immigration from Romania and Bulgaria to the UK actually decreased in the first three months of this year - despite restrictions on their movement being lifted. I never fell for the alarmist language from Ukip and the Government about an "influx" from the two countries. Ludicrous claims abounded that "up to 29 million" Romanian and Bulgarians would settle here - simply because that is their combined populations. When a handful of Romanians got off the plane to be greeted by Keith Vaz on New Year's Day, it seemed obvious the "flood" wasn't going to happen. The Government will say that numbers are down because they stopped immigrants from those two countries claiming benefits for the first three months. But employment among immigrants is 81 per cent. So shouldn't the UK issue an apology to Sofia and Bucharest?
