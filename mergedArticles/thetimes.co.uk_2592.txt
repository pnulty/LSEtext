A Sudanese paedophile jailed for a minimum of four years for raping and sexually abusing young girls is suing the Government, claiming his human rights were breached by delays in a parole hearing.
Adil Aboulkadir, 38, was one of five refugees from Darfur who attacked girls aged 13 and 14. Aboulkadir, who was living in Dartford, Kent, was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP) with a minimum term of at least four years after being convicted at Maidstone Crown Court in 2008 of rape and sexual activity with a child.
Judge Charles George, QC, has ruled at the High Court in London that Aboulkadir’s human rights were arguably violated by the Parole Board’s failure to consider his release as soon as the minimum term expired. He has ordered a full judicial review hearing.
Criminals given an IPP sentence can be freed only after serving their minimum term and if the Parole Board says they are no longer a threat. Aboulkadir’s case was dealt with 16 months after being referred to the board by the office of Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary.
Julian Blake, for Mr Grayling, said Aboulkadir’s challenge was too late and was academic as he was cleared for release by the Parole Board in September.
Aboulkadir is being detained at an immigration centre while he fights deportation to Sudan.
