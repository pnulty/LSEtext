DAVID Cameron last night admitted he has not brought immigration down by as much as he would like — as Brits rated it their top concern.
The PM conceded for the first time his Government is failing to cut the tidal wave of newcomers — on the up at a net 212,000 a year — saying the numbers are "still too high".
He also suggested for the first time he could FAIL to meet his 2010 election pledge to slash yearly arrivals to below 100,000.
He refused to answer MPs who asked if he would achieve it by next May as promised — only saying: "The figures will be what the figures are."
The concession — eight days before Euro elections — comes as a Sun YouGov poll today reveals immigration is now the most important issue for Brits.
For the first time, it was equal top with the economy. Both scored 52 per cent as people were asked to pick up to three of most concern to them. Despite spiralling numbers of new immigrants from the EU, Mr Cameron still refused to abandon his target, insisting "progress" was being made.
During a grilling from powerful MPs on the Liaison Committee, the PM said: "Net migration is down by a fifth under this Government — not as much as I'd like. The target remains — the commitment remains." He told of his irritation at the failure to deport more costly foreign prisoners, but branded a proposal by some Tory MPs to cut students from immigration stats as "playing with numbers".
It came on the eve of a first official indicator of how many Romanians and Bulgarians arrived after restrictions were lifted in January. t.newtondunn @the-sun.co.uk The Sun Says — Page Six
