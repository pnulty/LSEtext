NIGELLA Lawson's in good company. Wiley has also been turned away by immigration and was sent back from Canada on Wednesday evening.
The rapper, 35, tweeted: "Immigration have got me and are sending me back to London … Sad story. Telling me I have a criminal record in America. What are they saying, I have never been arrested in America.
"I am not even angry. This is the third time in life I have been denied from a place for nothing cos I have never been to jail in my life."
Then, for the grime MC, the final insult - being put on a plane to Scotland. He said: "OMG … sending me back to Scotland. Can you believe this? Glasgow … WTF … He said I can find my way to England from Glasgow … what a p***k."
On the plus side, Wiley, you can pick up some Irn-Bru.
