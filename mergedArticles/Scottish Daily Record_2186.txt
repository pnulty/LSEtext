DAVID Cameron's wife Samantha helped the family's foreign-born nanny secure British citizenship while she was working for them, it emerged last night.
Her name was entered on a citizenship application as the employer of Nepalese nanny Gita Lima in 2010.
Lima's citizenship was granted near the end of that year. Cameron became PM in May 2010. The revelation comes after Tory immigration minister James Brokenshire this week said a "wealthy metropolitan elite" used immigrants to provide "cheap labour".
Labour MP John Mann is demanding to know which ministers have employed foreign domestic staff.
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has admitted hiring a Belgian "home help".
