Says..
THE NHS wasted a staggering Â£46million on "pointless" jobs last year.
Shocking. This money should have been spent on hard-working nurses and doctors.
Instead health chiefs blew the lot on needless spin doctors and bureaucrats.
Have they gone mad? The health service is being crippled by staff shortages and budget cuts.
The growing population and rampant immigration is pushing the NHS to the brink.
Campaigners say the cash could have paid for 1,662 full-time nurses.
The Government needs to get its priorities right.
Stop squandering taxpayers cash. And start spending it on those who need it - the patients and medical staff.
