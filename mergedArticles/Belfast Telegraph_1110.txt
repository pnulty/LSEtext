It was quite revealing when journalists went to interview the latest victims of hate crime in east Belfast yesterday.
Racist thugs broke windows in the property and also smashed the windscreen of a car parked outside. Yet a woman who had been in the property was out at work as usual. Her son could not go to his job because his car could not be driven.
These are two immigrants who are contributing to society here.
They are obviously hard-working and want to make better lives for themselves in this country. Yet they are the innocent targets of vicious thugs who contribute nothing to this community except to blacken the image of Northern Ireland throughout the world. Who would you rather have living next door?
