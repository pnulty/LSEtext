Scottish Home Affairs Editor A HIT squad of immigration officials is to target people trying to stay in the UK illegally after coming here for the Commonwealth Games.
Home Office sources confirmed yesterday a specialist team was set up last year to focus on this summer's sport spectacular in Glasgow. Immigration and security minister James Brokenshire said: "We'll ensure we maintain a strong border and that those who come to the UK do so legally and leave at the end of the stipulated period."
The Games involves 6,500 athletes from 71 countries, along with thousands more training staff, coaches, officials, media reps and fans.
Visa requirements will be relaxed but all visitors are expected to leave within a month of the event ending.
