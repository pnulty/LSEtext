MORE THAN half a million people immigrated to the UK last year, including a “statistically significant” increase in the number of people heading here from the EU.
Theresa May had vowed to cut net migration [PA]
The official figures make a mockery of the Conservative pledge to slash net migration to the “tens of thousands’ by next year. 
Officially net migration – the difference between migrants arriving and leaving the UK – stood at 212,000, according to the Office of National Statistics. 
Some 526,000 people arrived, including 201,000 from the EU, while 314,000 left. 
Sir Andrew Green of Migration Watch said: “These new figures confirm that migration from the EU has blown the Government off course in meeting its overall target.”
Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Tories immigration policy was “in shreds.”
Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May pledged to cut net migration - the difference between migrants leaving and arriving in the UK - to below 100,000 by the general election on May 7 next year.
But this target is moving further out of reach as the total rocketed from 177,000 last year to 212,000 - up 20 per cent.
This was driven by movement from EU citizens immigrating to Britain, which the Government has little power to control, from 158,000 to 201,000 - up 27 per cent.
Keith Vaz said the target was "unrealistic and unachievable" [PA]
As voters took to the polls in European and local elections, MPs and migration campaigners urged the Government to drop its "arbitrary" target.
Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: "Despite the Government's best efforts and repeated commitments to reducing the net migration figure it has remained the same.
"Controlling EU migration is impossible without reform. It is clear that their aim is unrealistic and unachievable. The Government should drop their target now."
Within these figures, 104,000 citizens of so-called EU15 countries - pre-2004 members of the union - arrived in the UK, up from 85,000 in the previous year.
Around 70,000 citizens of the EU8 countries, which joined the EU in 2004 and include Poland, came to the UK in the period, compared with 60,000 in the previous year.
And 23,000 citizens of Romanian and Bulgaria arrived in the period, before employment curbs for the two nations were lifted, up from 9,000 previous year.
Non-EU citizens immigrating to the UK dropped to 249,000 in the same period, from 260,000 the previous year.
Statisticians said this was due to fewer New Commonwealth citizens - such as those from India - arriving to study.
After the data was published, immigration and security minister James Brokenshire said: "Uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on our public services and forces down wages for people on low incomes.
"While recent net migration levels remain stable the figures show that it has fallen by a third since its peak in 2005 under the last government and that this Government's reforms have cut net migration from outside the EU to levels not seen since the late 1990s.
"We are building an immigration system that is fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants and tough on those who abuse the system or flout the law. We want to ensure that people come to the UK for the right reasons - to work hard and contribute to our economy and society."
