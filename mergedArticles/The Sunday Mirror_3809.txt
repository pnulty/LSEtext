AT least three UKIP Euro MPs have foreigners on their payroll despite the party blasting immigrants taking British jobs.
The disclosure comes after Nigel Farage said last week no British worker was fit to replace his German wife Kirsten as his Â£25,000-a-year secretary.
East Midlands MEP Roger Helmer has an Italian assistant, the South West's William Dartford employs a Dane and London MEP Gerard Batten has a Russian dissident on staff.
REVELATIONS Lib Dem MEP Sarah Ludford said Farage's antiimmigration party was "taking the British people for a ride".
Her party president Tim Farron accused UKIP of spreading lies.
The latest revelations come after a "jobless" British worker in a UKIP campaign poster complaining of cheap foreign labour turned out to be an Irish actor.
And a female "voter" pictured in their manifesto was Mr Farage's events manager Lizzy Vaid.
