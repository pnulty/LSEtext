Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has said he believes the UK Independence Party (Ukip) are "xenophobic" and "über-nationalist" but not racist.
The senior Conservative minister has criticised Ukip party leader Nigel Farage for preying on people's fear of immigration, describing the tactic as "shameful".
But speaking to The Telegraph, he said he did not believe "in [his] heart" that the party was racist.
Insisting its ethos was xenophobic instead, he said: "Xenophobia is the fear of anything that’s different, anything that’s unusual, that’s slightly foreign.
"In a way, they are a sort of über-nationalist party."

His comments come after Mr Farage was subjected to a barrage of criticism during an interview with LBC yesterday.
The Ukip leader was repeatedly challenged over recent suggestions that he felt "uncomfortable" hearing so many foreign languages spoken on trains in London.
The often heated exchanges were eventually interrupted by Farage's spin doctor, communications director Patrick O'Flynn, who said the interview had overrun.
Defending his party to journalist James O'Brien, he said: "All anyone wants to talk about is the idiots in Ukip.
"Wherever we have found people who have had extreme, racist, unpleasant views we have unceremoniously got rid of them...
"To hold out the views of handful of people as being representative of Ukip frankly is not the truth."
