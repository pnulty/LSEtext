They've been married for nearly seven years so no doubt they used to each other's fashion choices.
But Billie Piper took the unusual step of wearing a pair of Birkenstock sandals for an evening out on Thursday night as she headed for a date night with her husband Laurence Fox.
The 31-year-old actress was perhaps trying the very comfortable footwear out ahead of the summer as she strolled out of the Groucho Club in central London.
Billie's penchant for comfortable attire didn't stop there as she wore a pair of stonewashed skinny jeans and a loose-fitting top.
While she was clearly keen on getting some air to her feet, the Penny Dreadful actress covered up on her top half with a long grey coat.
Laurence also opted for a similar coat but in black and also wore a pair of skinny jeans for the evening.
But he didn't quite follow his wife's summery approach with his footwear as the 35-year-old star opted for a pair of green and brown boots for the occasion.
While wearing her comfortable white Birkenstocks, blonde beauty Billie didn't look to be fully embracing the comfort factor as she walked out of the private members club.
The Secret Diary Of A Call Girl star and her husband both looked in serious mode as they left the establishment.
However, the stars seemed far more relaxed when they got inside their taxi.
Billie's latest acting role sees her star in upcoming horror TV series Penny Dreadful alongside Josh Hartnett and Eva Green.
Billie plays Brona Croft, an Irish immigrant who aims to escape from her dark past, while Laurence's latest role has seen him play Guy Haines in the stage production of Strangers On A Train in London.
