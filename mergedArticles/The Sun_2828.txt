THE Sottish Government has launched a bid to keep £1,000 seized from an illegal immigrant.
Cops found out that Sri Lankan Ansaf Mohammadu was in the country illegally when they quizzed him about serious sexual offences.
Now ministers have raised a bid at Perth Sheriff Court to keep £1,020, confiscated from him at the city's police station last October.
Mohammadu — who was deported a month later — admitted working illegally as a cleaner.
Court papers from the case say: "The proceeds of unlawful employment are recoverable property."
