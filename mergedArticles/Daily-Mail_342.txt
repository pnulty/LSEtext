THE immigration minister had to apologise yesterday over a 12-hour computer glitch which caused 'a national embarrassment' at airports across Britain.
As the Government launched an investigation into the meltdown of the main UK immigration computer network, Home Office minister James Brokenshire said he was sorry the IT crash had caused inconvenience to so many. He went on to say: 'Our engineers have been working to fix the problems and all ports are now functioning normally.
'We apologise for the delays, but security must remain our priority at all times.'
The immigration system failure forced people to queue for up to four hours to get into the country as passport control staff were no longer able to scan documents electronically and had to manually process every arrival.
Police were called to Luton Airport amid reports of fights breaking out among 'angry and frustrated' passengers, and queues at Gatwick and Heathrow were said to 'stretch for miles'. Mr Brokenshire added: 'I have asked technical staff to look into the incident to ensure lessons are learnt.'
