A DEFIANT Scot has snubbed pleas to quit Crimea — despite Brits being urged to flee the hotspot.
Retired soldier Norry Hughes is staying amid a power struggle between Russia and Ukraine.
Worried Foreign Office chiefs have urged immigrants like Norry to quit. But the OAP, 74, insists embassy bosses in Kiev have ignored his emails asking for advice.
He said: "I have no protection whatsoever from the British Government. I've been deserted by the country of my birth."
The ex-Scots Guard moved to the port city of Sevastopol from Edinburgh 13 years ago.
Norry, whose wife Terraza, 42, died in 2010, said: "Things are changing quickly. Businesses and hotels are putting up Russian insignia."
Last night the Foreign Office said: "British nationals in Crimea should leave now."
