BRANDISHING his assault rifle with bayonet fixed, one of the Queen's Guards challenges a would-be intruder outside Buckingham Palace.
This is the dramatic moment a ceremonial soldier confronted ranting illegal immigrant Tosin Odunaiya, 23, in front of shocked tourists.
The serviceman pointed his SA80 rifle as the Nigerian shouted at police and approached the palace gates.
He dashed 50 yards to level the weapon, affixed with a razor-sharp bayonet, at Odunaiya's throat.
The Coldstream Guardsman broke protocol by intervening, as they are only meant to leave their posts if a member of the Royal Family is in danger. Security is the responsibility of Scotland Yard.
But top brass are understood to have backed the soldier's actions during the incident at the North Centre Gate, which took place shortly before 6pm on Friday.
It was the fifth time Odunaiya, of Kingston, south-west London, had tried to get into the palace. He later sent out a sinister tweet saying: 'Why did you have to pull that toy on me!? If I die! I will come back at you with no mercy. Last warning.'
