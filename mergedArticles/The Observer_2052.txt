This absorbing psychological thriller transposes a short story by Raymond Carver from the US Pacific northwest to New South Wales. Gabriel Quinn plays an Irish immigrant garage-owner on a macho fishing trip, who delays reporting the discovery of an aboriginal girl's corpse and comes into serious conflict with the local population. Meanwhile his American wife (Laura Linney) conceals her pregnancy.
A well-acted tale of suppression and evasion, and very Australian.
