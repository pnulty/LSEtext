THE City of Leeds secondary school has just become the first school in the country to teach all of its pupils English as if it were a foreign language. The headteacher has said that even the 15 per cent of pupils who were born in Britain need the classes because their language skills are so poor.
The problem is even more acute for the rest of the children who come from 55 different countries and between them speak 50 different languages.
For all its perceived failings the school – which last year posted the poorest GCSE results in Leeds – has been left in an impossible position by rampant immigration from eastern Europe and the rest of the world.
Filling our classrooms with pupils who cannot communicate with the staff and children around them is desperately unfair. The children who do speak English fluently are clearly going to find their time in education far less beneficial if they are forced to sit through lessons tailored for others whose communication skills are years behind. As Ukip leader Nigel Farage says: "It is just increasing division in our society."
The ability to speak English well enough to keep up with the class has to be considered a basic requirement for a place in a British school. After all, there is only so much that the schools can achieve when many immigrant families still refuse to speak English at home.
