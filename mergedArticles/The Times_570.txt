Hostile political rhetoric on immigration is threatening the quality of British science, the head of the country's largest medical research charity has warned.
Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, said there was an increasing perception abroad that "our doors are not open" to foreign scientists after it emerged that Britain had used only an eighth of its visa allocation last year. "The tone of some of the discussions is sometimes very unhelpful," Dr Farrar said. "If other countries are sending out more positive messages, people are going to go there instead."
His comments came as research funding bodies, including the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society, announced details of a scheme agreed with the Home Office to fast-track visa applications for the most exceptional scientists.
A candidate's application will be automatically endorsed if they are recommended for Tier 1 status by their funding body, rather than having to apply for endorsement from the Royal Society. The arrangements address concerns that only 25 scientists were approved for Tier 1 visas last year, despite a Home Office cap of 200.
Dr Farrar said that without being able to attract talented international scientists, Britain would lose its competitive edge.
