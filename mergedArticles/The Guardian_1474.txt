David Cameron has defended his decision to employ a Nepalese nanny, while at the same time refusing to say that his government will meet its target to cut the number of net migrants to the UK to fewer than 100,000 by next year. Last week James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, accused a metropolitan elite of employing home helps from abroad, making it more difficult for the government to meet its immigration targets. No 10 insists Cameron followed proper processes when Gita Lima applied for UK citizenship in 2010. On his visit to Israel, Cameron said Lima had passed a citizenship test and was a woman who worked hard and wanted to get on. He also said immigration levels needed to come down. Patrick Wintour
