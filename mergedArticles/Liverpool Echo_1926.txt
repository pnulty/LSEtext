JONATHAN CREEK BBC1, 9pm When Alan Davis returned to our screens last week as the eponymous illusionist-turnedcrimesolver, it was almost as though he'd never been away. In actual fact, it's been 10 years since the actor graced a regular schedule slot in this particular role, and while we were hardly crying out for yet another mystery drama series, it's still good to have him back. In this latest instalment, Creek and Polly are keen to settle into rural life, but it would seem that their apparently serene country village is actually anything but. Meanwhile, Creek pays a visit to a former psychic magician who is about to pull off the most baffling act of clairvoyance in history.
CRUFTS 2014 Channel 4, 7.30pm Having returned from distinctly chillier climes, reporting on the Winter Olympics last month, Clare Balding is basking in the relative warmth of the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, where she's presenting highlights of the second day's action at the annual dog show to end all dog shows. Crufts, having been around for over 120 years, is the jewel in the Kennel Club's crown and is the event all dog owners go barking mad for.
THE PROPOSAL BBC1, 10.35pm A Canadian publishing editor working in New York faces deportation to her own country. Desperate to stay in America, she offers her assistant a promotion if he will marry her, but an immigration official becomes suspicious and the pair are forced to go to desperate lengths to look like a happy couple. Romantic comedy, directed by Anne Fletcher, starring Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds, Mary Steenburgen, Craig T Nelson, Betty White, Denis O'Hare, Malin Akerman and Oscar Nunez.
