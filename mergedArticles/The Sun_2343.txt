Workers 'needed to balance books'
AN indy Scotland would have to increase immigration to balance the books, a new study says.
The neutral report warns an influx of foreign workers would be needed because of soaring pension costs.
The revelation emerged in an analysis on Scottish independence by experts at investment giant Exane BNP Paribas.
They warned Scotland had a "far worse demographic" than the rest of the UK in terms of ageing population — meaning "less people to generate wealth and more people to support".
The study said the high number of OAPs did NOT destroy the argument for a split.
But it stressed: "Encouraging inward migration of labour to offset the current demographic profile and maintain a healthy economy would be essential."
SNP chiefs have said they'd increase immigration under independence — but not how urgent the policy would be.
The latest data, published in 2013, showed Scotland had 369,284 foreign-born residents.
The analsis by the brokers — aimed at informing big-money investors — said there was a "realistic chance of independence".
The report added that being part of the EU would be vital to make it easier for foreign workers to move here. It said: "We see no reason why, with the help of EU membership and the right economic policies Scotland could not attract sufficient labour to fuel healthy economic growth rates."
Labour's shadow pensions minister Gregg McClymont, below, said: "Alex Salmond must come clean on how much extra immigration would be needed to pay for pensions in a separate Scotland." SNP Veterans minister Keith Brown said: "Our controlled immigration system will ensure those given entry are here for right reasons."
