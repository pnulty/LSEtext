CAPTAIN AMERICA: The Winter Soldier **** (Cert 12A; 136mins)
YOU have to feel sorry for Captain America, he is not the coolest superhero on the planet.
Iron Man is a charismatic cocktail of cutting–edge technology and a king–size ego. Thor is a strapping god, while the Incredible Hulk has his anger management issues and frequent wardrobe malfunctions.
So it's hard to compete when all you have to offer is a Charles Atlas back story, stars–and–stripes heroism and a costume that is more boilersuit than fashion plate.
Maybe that's why Marvel's Captain America: The Winter Soldier works a little harder to devise a plot that goes beyond the traditional evil race from outer space out to conquer planet Earth.
There is a fairly complex conspiracy theory plot at the heart of the film that plays on topical fears of how much our most respectable institutions can be trusted to behave with our best interests at heart.
A war on terror makes it much more acceptable to erode the civil liberties we once took for granted.
This is all about friendship, faith and betrayal with Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury uttering the most useful advice: "Don't trust anyone."
The film also mines some poignancy from the plight of Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans). Thawed out after decades in cold storage, he has outlived his friends and the values that once made life so straightforward.
His beloved Peggy (Hayley Atwell) is now an elderly, bedridden woman half in the clutches of dementia.
A charming moment finds him walking through The Smithsonian, where a Captain America exhibition is as popular as the Vikings and the Pharaohs. He is a relic of the past, struggling to adjust to the complexities of a present in which Shield leader Fury was not being entirely honest with him.
A mission to rescue captured hostages is achieved with customary, two–fisted aplomb but Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) has her own agenda that Captain America knew nothing about.
What does doing the right thing even mean any more? What is really going on and what it has to do with slick politician Alexander Pierce (a dapper, ironically cast Robert Redford) is something you'll have to discover for yourself.
The screenplay cleverly folds in elements from Captain America's past and builds a sense that evil is some kind of tenacious garden weed that will never be eradicated because you can't quite get to the root of it.
We shouldn't get too carried away with the plot as it is still reliant on the kind of twists and surprises that seem entirely predictable, even down to the identity of the ruthless, soulless Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who becomes central to the whole dastardly enterprise.
There is also a tendency to fall back on endless, mindless shootouts on city streets and bouts of well–choreographed fisticuffs in which each blow seems like a killer but nobody ever suffers more than a minor cut or temporary breathlessness.
When everyone is indestructible there is little real sense of anyone being expendable.
The Winter Soldier is still a pretty decent superhero epic with welcome additions to the mix including Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson, aka Falcon, and a smoothly, persuasive Redford enjoying himself in an uncharacteristic role.
Regulars will know to stay beyond the end credits for a little taster of what to expect in the next exciting instalment.
20 FEET FROM STARDOM ***** (Cert 12A; 91mins)
BEHIND many of the greatest rock 'n' roll performances lie the unsung talents of some thrilling back–up singers.
What would the Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter be without Merry Clayton's contribution or Michael Jackson's Thriller album without the harmonies of the Waters family?
Morgan Neville's Oscar–winning documentary begins to make amends to those lesser–known individuals who have spent their careers in the shadows of more celebrated names.
Mick Jagger, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder and Bette Midler are among those singing the praises of back–up singers and questioning the fickle nature of celebrity and success.
Darlene Love provides a typical tale from the back room. Love, who was a back–up singer for Frank Sinatra and Dionne Warwick among others, was signed by Phil Spector but never enjoyed the stardom she deserved. After her solo career floundered she was working as a cleaner before making a comeback.
The film has tales of triumph and disaster, lost opportunities and curtailed careers but is at its most magical when the women are allowed to sing and we savour the full power and range of their voices.
An informative, eye–opening film told with love and filled with joy.
STAR RATINGS.

MUPPETS MOST WANTED ** (Cert U; 113mins)
THERE is a jolly song near the beginning of Muppets Most Wanted warning us that sequels are "never quite as good" and how right they are.
The latest caper staggers around the globe in search of a half–decent plot and amusing jokes. It seems to go on for ever, serving up endless random cameos (Lady Gaga, Tony Bennett, Hugh Bonneville, etc) and desperate actors trying to mine comedy gold from sporting zilly foreign accents.
Did we not stop doing that when Peter Sellers died? Flushed by their return to the limelight, Kermit, Miss Piggy and the gang are bamboozled into signing up for a world tour by unscrupulous promoter Dominic Badguy, an ill–at–ease Ricky Gervais.
He is in cahoots with evil frog Constantine who escapes from a Russian gulag and swaps places with Kermit. Animal is the only one who notices the difference.
Your eyes may be glazing over at this point as we scurry from Berlin to Madrid, Dublin to London while poor Kermit languishes in Siberia directing the gulag annual revue show for Soviet guard Nadya (Tina Fey).
Nobody thought this may appear a tad tasteless? Frantic and charmless, this is a big flabby disappointment.
THe PasT **** (Cert 12A; 130mins)
BÉRÉNICE BEJO won the Best Actress prize at Cannes for her performance in this, showing impressive range in a role far removed from her crowd–pleasing turn as flapper girl Peppy Miller in The Artist.
Here she's the careworn Marie, an estranged wife caught between lingering issues with her husband Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa), her angry teenage daughter and a complex relationship with new partner Samir (Tahar Rahim) and his young son. When Ahmad arrives in Paris to sign divorce papers it brings everything to a head, subtly conveying all the simmering resentments in a deeply fractured family unit.
Director Asghar Farhadi has us observe the heady mix of malice, good intentions and misunderstandings as flawed humans make the most of impossible circumstances.
Not quite in the same league as Farhadi's Oscar–winning A Separation but still an intense, compelling slice of family life.
AFTERNOON DELIGHT *** (Cert 18; 96mins)
THIS is awkwardly poised between John Cassavetes–style soul searching and Judd Apatow–style raciness, with some tart lines and toe–curling situations but it never finds the courage to really run with its premise.
Housewife Rachel (Kathryn Hahn) is a woman on the verge of a breakdown, bored by her affluent lifestyle, neglectful of her son and exasperated by husband Jeff (Josh Radnor), a man who barely seems present even when they are in the same room.
Intent on spicing up their nonexistent sex life Rachel coaxes Jeff to attend a strip club.
Later she goes out of her way to befriend lap dancer McKenna (Juno Temple) and welcomes her into her home. Rachel's walk on the wild side has fairly predictable consequences suggesting discontent is a luxury for people with too much time on their hands and too much money in the bank.
THE Borderlands *** (Cert 15; 89mins)
ONE of the smarter British chillers of recent years, Elliot Goldner's low–key, low–budget yarn is sharply written and well acted.
It makes effective use of the "found footage" formula to tell the tale of Vatican investigator Deacon (Gordon Kennedy) and Gray (Rob Hill) as they challenge claims a miracle has happened in a small West Country parish.
Headcam footage and CCTV cameras reveal the weary Deacon's conviction there is more going on here than cynical fakery.
There's a lurch into Da Vinci Code territory as faith is tested and religion's acknowledged as a source of both good and evil.
THE Fold ** (Cert 15; 87mins)
A STRONG performance from Catherine McCormack and some well–used Cornish locations are the main attractions of The Fold, a sombre, low–budget British drama.
Nearly a year after her daughter's tragic death McCormack's fragile priest Rebecca arrives at a new parish with surviving daughter Eloise (Dakota Blue Richards).
Rebecca takes a motherly interest in Radka (Marina Stoimenova), a Bulgarian immigrant who is working at the annual daffodil harvest.
The relationship grows more intense but the stilted dialogue and some melodramatic performances cannot sustain credibility.
