Immigration figures released for the past year are yet more proof of the damage being done by unfettered immigration from the EU.
David Cameron pledged in 2010 to reduce net immigration to below 100,000 by 2015. Net immigration for the past year was a staggering 212,000 and represents a brutal blow to Mr Cameron’s hopes of getting a grip on the problem before the next election.
The number of immigrants coming to this country now stands at more than half a million every year and the main cause is our membership of the EU. Immigration from within the EU rose alarmingly in the past year from 149,000 to 209,000. However immigration from non-EU nations – which the Government still has the power to restrict – has fallen by 15,000 over the same period.
Mr Cameron has been powerless to stem the tide of immigrants from Europe because of the EU’s barmy rules on freedom of movement. A fortnight ago Jose Barroso, the president of the European Commission, even admitted that limitless immigration has caused “strains" in Britain. He also made it abundantly clear that we can expect no repatriation of border control powers while we’re still under the yoke of Brussels.
As this newspaper has repeatedly warned we will be forced to endure the crippling effects of rampant immigration until Britain leaves the EU.

Bonus reward for failures
The Royal Bank of Scotland is dishing out £576million in bonuses despite making a loss of £8.2billion in the past three years and with plans under way to axe 30,000 jobs in the next 12 months. Even chief executive Ross McEwan has shown that he recognises it is a ridiculous state of affairs by turning down his own lavish bonus.
Six years ago taxpayers were forced to stump up £46billion to rescue the failing bank. Today we still own 80 per cent of RBS and it is far from strong enough to return to the private sector. Rewarding failure with vast bonuses cannot go on for ever.

Man Utd face the strap
News that former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson still has the belt with which he was whipped at school will terrify his beleaguered former players. The club are languishing in sixth place in the Premier League even though Sir Alex is still at Old Trafford as one of Manchester United’s directors.
The current crop of players and staff should be on the lookout. There’s every chance their next thrashing could be at the hands of Sir Alex rather than a rival team.
