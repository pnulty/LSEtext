NEXT month's Euro elections will be a triumph for Ukip.
They'll double their 2010 vote. Even if they don't beat Labour into first place, they'll come close.
What is more significant in our poll today is that their extra support is predicted to evaporate before the General Election next year.
Ukip voters are sick of the three main parties. They are angry over our place in Europe and the soaring immigration from the EU we are currently powerless to stop.
But just maybe they are starting to realise that only the Tories have the will — and the ability — to do anything about it.
And that every vote for Nigel Farage's party in May NEXT year will make it less likely they'll get the chance.
