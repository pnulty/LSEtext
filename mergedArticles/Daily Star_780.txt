A MOTHER tried to smuggle four illegal immigrants into Britain inside a VW camper van to clear her Â£3,000 cocaine debts.
Crystal Mosley, 27, and lover Daniel Hassard, 25, were caught as they were about to board a ferry near Calais.
The illegal passengers, three from Vietnam and one from China, were hiding in the back.
Mosley and Hassard, both from Marton, near Blackpool, admitted people smuggling charges.
Painter and decorator Hassard was jailed for 15 months after claiming the operation was "his idea."
Mosley was also given 15-months but it was suspended for two years so she could care for her nine-year-old son.
Details of the couple's shame emerged at Canterbury Crown Court last Friday.
After the case David Fairclough from Home Office Criminal Investigations said: "Those involved in people smuggling prey on the desperation of others to line their own pockets and are a major factor in illegal immigration to the UK."
