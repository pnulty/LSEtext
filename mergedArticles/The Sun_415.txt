POP FANCY DRESS STORM
AN anti-racism MP poses for a pic with his son — who's blacked up to look like Michael Jackson.
Labour's Ian Lavery, 51, was snapped with 25-yearold Ian Jnr, who wore the Thriller outfit to a fancy dress party.
The son posted the photo online triggering racist comments — all of which the warehouse worker "liked".
One pal called him a "liquorice stick", a second dubbed him "Lanky the n*gga" and a third wrote: "Your dads probably thinking who's the immigrant". But ano-ther branded the make-up "appallingly racist", claiming the MP showed "total disrespect" by posing with his lad. Ian Jnr also posted a snap holding his crotch like Jacko, right. The images emerged weeks after the MP for Wansbeck, Northumberland — who's president of the National Union of Mineworkers — backed an anti-racism rally. Yesterday he denied the stunt was racist, saying: "Absolute nonsense." Ian Jnr, of Ashington, Northumberland, wouldn't comment. In April he was blasted over a sick tweet about Katie Price's disabled son Harvey. r.perrie@the-sun.co.uk
