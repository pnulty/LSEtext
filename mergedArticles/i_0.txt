A head teacher who funded the £2,000 bail money for one of her "best students" to release her from an immigration centre is trying to prevent the teenager's deportation to Mauritius amid claims she will be attacked if she is returned.
Classmates and teachers are rallying behind Yashika Bageerathi, 19, with a protest outside the Home Office, ahead of a flight that has been scheduled for tomorrow.
Ms Bageerathi came to the UK in 2012 with her mother and brother to escape alleged attempts at sexual assault. She had since been attending Oasis Academy Hadley in Enfield, north London, until she was detained at the Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre. As part of the asylum process, Ms Bageerathi was required to sign on at the Home Office every week since her arrival. Now she is over 18, however, her case has been separated from her other family members. Ms Bageerathi is predicted to get an A* in maths and French, and a B in chemistry. She has university offers at all five of her choices, including scholarships at Newcastle and Queen Mary's.
The Home Office declined to comment.
