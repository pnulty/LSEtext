It’s the Second World War, all the men have gone to war. Fritzi, a spirited first-generation Polish immigrant, joins her sisters to run an all-girl filling station — on roller-skates and wearing snappy short skirts. Cut to Alabama in 2005. Sookie is exhausted after marrying off the last of her three daughters. Four weddings later (one girl got married twice), she’s looking forward to a little peace with her husband, though she still has to look after her beautiful, barmy old southern belle of a mother. However, a registered letter arrives and Sookie is horrified to find out that she was adopted. She has grown up worrying about the genetic “curse” that runs through her mother’s family; now she’s being told that her real mother is called Fritzi Willinka. Flagg is a writer of great warmth and wisdom; Sookie’s voyage of discovery takes her back to the 1940s, and a glorious, richly imagined family saga.
