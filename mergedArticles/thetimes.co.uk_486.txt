Immigrants have cost the taxpayer more than £22 million a day, or £140 billion in total, over the past 17 years, a report claims.
Despite their financial contribution in terms of jobs and taxes, immigrants have overall been a fiscal burden and not a benefit, Migration Watch says.
The report, the latest to fuel the debate on immigration figures, challenges recent findings by the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration at University College London, which claimed that recent migrants made a “very sizeable contribution" — a net benefit of £25 billion.
This concluded that migrants contributed 34 per cent more than they received, amounting to more than £20 billion from 2001 to 2011, and they were only half as likely to claim state benefits as the general population.
However, analysis by Migration Watch, which lobbies for sustainable levels of managed immigration, concludes that the “true figure" is a net cost, when the level of taxes paid or benefits claimed is properly taken into account.
Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the independent think-tank, said: “Our report disposes of the immigration lobby’s claims that immigration reduces our tax burden. The cost is high and increased dramatically between 1995 and 2011, providing no compensation for the overcrowding of this island."
