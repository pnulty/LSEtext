WHAT would Ed Miliband do about soaring immigration, voters' equal-highest priority? Answer: Next to nothing.
That's because the Labour leader doesn't believe the huge annual influx is a problem in itself.
Never mind the pressure on housing, schools, hospitals and transport.
The two things that really matter, Ed tells Sun cabbie Grant Davis on Page 23, are his "cost-of-living crisis" and the NHS.
It does bother him some migrants undercut British workers. He'd do something about it if elected PM.
But he'd do nothing about the open movement of people between EU countries, the biggest cause of our soaring net migration. He might vaguely lobby the EU for reform.
As for a referendum, forget it.
And since the Tories are committed to one, with even the Lib Dems now warming to it, that makes the election choice easier for those worried about migrants from the EU.
We do applaud Mr Miliband's promise of a tax cut for low-earners.
Except we'd remind him the Coalition has also done that every year, despite the recession, by hiking the tax-free earnings threshold.
Perhaps Ed's hoping no one noticed.
