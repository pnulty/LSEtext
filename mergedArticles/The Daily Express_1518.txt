SCOTLAND could get greater powers over tax if it decides to stay in the UK, David Cameron hinted yesterday.
Opening the Scottish Conservative conference in Edinburgh, the Prime Minister said he was committed to making devolution work better.
On September 18, Scots will decide in a referendum whether to go it alone. Mr Cameron promised: "A vote for No is not a vote for 'no change'."
He stopped short of spelling out any detail on what new powers the Holyrood parliament could have. But he said the Conservatives wanted devolution to "work better still". Anticipating fears that more powers will make independence inevitable, even if Scots reject it this year, he stressed greater devolution would not give Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond "a consolation prize if Scotland votes No, but because it's the right thing to do".
The Scottish government already has the power to vary income tax by 3p but has never used it.
Home Secretary Theresa May also told the conference the British Government would expect passport checks between Scotland and England if a looser immigration policy north of the border is adopted after independence.
She warned that the SNP's pledge to pursue "healthy population growth" would "undermine" Tory policies in England.
Meanwhile, an opinion poll this week put support for independence at its highest level for more than six months. Survation found 39.3 per cent would vote for independence, compared with 47.6 per cent wanting to stay in the UK.
