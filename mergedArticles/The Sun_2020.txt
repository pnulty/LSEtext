He slams Cam over 'voter deception'
BORIS Johnson has lashed out at David Cameron for "not doing anything" over the flood of immigrants from the EU.
The London Mayor warned that voters will feel "deceived" unless we urgently change "freedom of movement" rules.
BoJo — tipped as a future Tory leader — told Total Politics magazine that migrants should find work before coming so they do not need benefits. And he said people in new EU states should wait "much longer" before they can move here. He added: "There's no reason why we need to have completely untrammelled movement." It comes after The Sun issued a red line demand to the PM: win back our power to halt immigration from the EU.
Tory backbenchers fear Ukip is winning the argument ahead of next month's Euro elections.
