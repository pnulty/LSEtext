UKIP has rejected as "nonsense" Tory criticism of it using an Irish actor in a poster about the impact of immigration on British jobs.
The poster features a builder begging on the street next to the slogans 'EU policy at work' and 'British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour'.
But it has emerged the man is Dubliner Dave O''Rourke, prompting Conservative MP Bob Neill to criticise the party. He said: "I think it is pretty hypocritical of Ukip. They are using a trick most other parties stopped using long ago, because they get found out doing it. "As far as I am aware, we always use genuine people in our ads."
Ukip's Patrick O''Flynn insisted the use of actors was "totally standard practice".
"It is nonsense for the Conservatives to depict this as anything out of the ordinary. For example, the people depicted in the Conservatives'' 'You paid the taxes...' campaign under William Hague were actors. So, Bob Neill needs to go and berate the Foreign Secretary if he really thinks there is anything wrong... this is pure Tory party humbug."
