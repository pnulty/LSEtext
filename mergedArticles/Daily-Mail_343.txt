UKIP is upping the stakes in its controversial anti-immigration campaign for the European elections by unveiling another provocative poster focusing on EU migration.
Showing an escalator ascending the White Cliffs of Dover, it claims the EU's free movement rules mean Britain has 'no border' and 'no control' over incomers.
The party has been criticised for running adverts attacking eurocrats and workers from the Continent who, it says, take UK jobs.
But an unrepentant Ukip leader Nigel Farage said last night: 'This is the most powerful image of the European election campaign.
'The White Cliffs have always been symbolic of Britain's island status. That status should give us added ability to pick the people who come to live and work in our country. But under EU free movement laws we have no serious control.'
The Tories will today unveil a poster of a ballot box marked Europe: You Decide alongside the words: 'An In-Out Referendum on Europe. Labour and the Lib Dems won't. Ukip can't. We will in 2017.'
÷ More than twice as many EU migrants live in the UK as there are Britons on the continent. Oxford University's Migration Observatory says 2.6million EU nationals live in the UK, with just over a million Britons living in Europe.
