A BRIDE and groom were arrested yesterday after a suspected sham marriage was stopped minutes before they wed.
Home Office immigration staff swooped on the register office in Winchester, Hants, after a tip-off.
The 21-year-old bride from France, is believed to have been wed twice before — but neither marriage was dissolved. She was arrested on suspicion of perjury, bigamy and assisting unlawful immigration.
The groom, 26, from Cameroon, whose leave to remain in the UK expires shortly, was held on suspicion of perjury.
