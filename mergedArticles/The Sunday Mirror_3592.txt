AS many as 340 people are living in slavery in Ireland.
The Global Slavery Index, produced by the Walk Free Foundation, said Ireland was a destination country for criminals trafficking people into the country for forced labour and the sex trade.
The study claimed most of the victims of slavery here are women controlled by gangs.
The Immigrant Council of Ireland said the report, which was released late last year, highlights the need for stricter laws and the purchase of sex to be made illegal.
Chief executive Denise Charlton said: "The Global Index again confirms the most prevalent form of trafficking in Ireland is for sexual exploitation, with the victims mostly women and girls."
