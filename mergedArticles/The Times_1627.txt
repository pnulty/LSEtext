David Cameron is keen to tighten rules on EU immigration after Germanysaid migrants who fail to find work in member states should be expelled.
Ministers announced a series of immigration reforms at the start of the year to tackle the electoral threat from Ukip, but Mr Cameron has now said that he may go farther.
Mr Cameron told the BBC: "We are going to work with Angela Merkel, with the Swedish Prime Minister, with the Dutch Prime Minister on how we can tighten up in this area."
Mr Cameron's hopes of reforming Britain's ties with Brussels received another boost when the German finance minister suggested EU treaties needed to be changed soon.
The Prime Minister wants a treaty change to secure a new relationship with the EU.
Wolfgang Schäuble said that "institutional improvements" would be needed after the European Parliament elections in May.
Raoul Ruparel, from the Open Europe think-tank, said Germany had now been "far more explicit" about supporting a major treaty change.
"Importantly for David Cameron, it is also the first time that Germany has made it clear treaty change will be on the table in the near future rather than being kicked into the long grass."
