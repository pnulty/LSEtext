Yes WE have friends who moved to Spain several years ago and are slowly learning to speak Spanish ("UK school that teaches English as 2nd language", March 25).
If they have problems understanding the meaning of the country's laws, etc, they have to pay for an interpreter to help them.
It seems that in this country it doesn't appear to matter whether you are from Outer Mongolia or the depths of the Amazon jungle, we will find someone to help you translate - free of course.
Is it just me or do others think we are too much of a soft touch? John Hearn, Rainham, Kent No LIKE it or not, we live in a multicultural society and need to make the most of it for everyone.
Young people who quite often cannot read or write in their own language, let alone English, have no chance in life if we ignore them.
They have far more chance of getting a good job and contributing to society if we help them.
Having said that, schools in areas with high numbers of immigrants should be given the resources required to do the job.
The quicker the children can learn English, the better for everyone.
