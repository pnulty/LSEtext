The case of a teenager threatened with rapid deportation without her family should be reviewed urgently, the shadow immigration minister has said.
More than a hundred people held a demonstration at the Home Office yesterday in support of Yashika Bageerathi, who came to Britain in 2012 to seek shelter from threats of violence in her home country. She faces being sent back to Mauritius as early as tomorrow after the Home Office refused her appeal to stay in the UK. Her case was considered separately to that of her mother, brother and sister because at the age of 19 she is considered an adult.
Yashika fled Mauritius after threats of violence by a family member, who is allegedly involved with drug dealing and is accused of an attempted sexual assault.
Shadow minister David Hanson called the decision to deport her "very unfair" and urged the Home Office to consider a fresh appeal lodged by her lawyers arguing that deportation would infringe her right to a family life. "It seems very unfair for the Home Office to deport Yashika without considering her family circumstances and to deport her alone, given the circumstances of her original move to the UK. I know that representations have been made and I hope the Home Office can review those urgently."
Yashika has been attending Oasis Academy Hadley for more than two years and is being held at Yarl's Wood detention centre.
