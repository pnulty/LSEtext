OPEN BORDERS SHOCK EU immigrants to overtake non-EU EU immigrants to overtake non-EU
MINISTERS fear EU immigrants are now outnumbering arrivals from the rest of the world — heaping more pressure on the PM to get tough on Europe.
Largely from debt-hit south and eastern European states, the amount of continental newcomers could top 250,000 for the first time.
The bombshell stats are due to be confirmed when official 2013 immigration figures come out in two weeks. They make a nonsense of David Cameron's vow to get net migration — the number arriving in the country minus the number leaving — down to 100,000 a year.
Under EU rules, Britain is powerless to stop anyone coming here from the other 27 member states.
Demands Anger is growing among senior Tories that the PM is asking too little from Brussels in his renegotiation bid. He has refused to include any curtailing of the freedom-of-movement principle in his seven public demands.
One minister told The Sun: "We simply have to go further. The numbers in a few weeks will prove that.
"It's frustrating as we've made a lot of progress cutting non-EU arrivals. The PM has got to put freedom of movement on the table."
The stats bolster The Sun's Red Line demand for Mr Cameron to win back control of UK borders or see Brits vote to leave the EU in 2017.
Figures from February show 141,000 more non-EU immigrants arrived than left in the year to September 2013. But that was down 20,000 on a year earlier.
Meanwhile net EU immigration doubled to a record 131,000, just behind the non-EU tally. MigrationWatch UK last night backed Tory calls to restrict movement — predicting more than 500,000 more EU immigrants will arrive within five years.
It said: "We must achieve a significant reduction." Non-EU newcomers are at their lowest level since 1998 — but the explosion of EU arrivals has left the Tories unable to gloat.
The next figures are due out on May 22 — European and council elections polling day.
