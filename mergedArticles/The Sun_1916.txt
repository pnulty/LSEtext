BLUE-COLLAR workers do lose jobs when immigrants flood into the country, an official report revealed yesterday.
They suffer when times are hard because firms opt for cheaper employees from overseas.
Officials said the findings echo Home Secretary Theresa May's warnings that immigration does cause unemployment.
But there is little to suggest workers lose out due to immigration in a strong economy, the Home Office report says.
Tory MPs blasted the BBC after its Newsnight programme on Tuesday said the report would show the effect was "actually very, very small".
Backbencher Michael Ellis told The Sun: "Newsnight and the BBC should apologise. It's clear now that what they were reporting on air was in fact wrong and that the Government was right."
Theresa May has often referred to an earlier Migration Advisory Committee report from 2012 when claiming immigration needed to be cut.
It claims for every extra 100 non-EU migrants, 23 fewer "native" people are employed.
Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi said that report had not been "contradicted" by the Beeb.
Newsnight's Chris Cook claimed yesterday it had, but admitted research into the issue had been "very narrowly drawn". He said it did not "seek to cover all the economic impacts, let alone the cultural or social effects, of large movements of people".
