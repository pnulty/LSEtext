UKIP CHIEF CRUSHES CLEGG Urges Brits: Join the people's army
NIGEL Farage last night trounced Nick Clegg in their second EU debate as he called on Britain to join the people's army to overthrow Brussels rule.
A YouGov poll for The Sun found 68 per cent thought the Ukip leader won the TV clash.
Only 27 per cent called it for the Lib Dem leader.
The anti-EU party boss's last words on the BBC2 showdown were: "Come and join the people's army and let's topple the establishment who led us to this mess."
Mr Farage also predicted the EU would collapse in violence. He said: "I want the EU to end democratically. If it doesn't, it will end very unpleasantly.
"We see in Madrid, we see in Athens very large protests, a lot of violence.
"You take away from people the ability through the ballot box to change their future then they tend to resort to aggressive means."
Mr Clegg branded Mr Farage's support for Russian president Vladimir Putin in Crimea and Syria "utterly indefensible".
But Mr Farage hit back: "You wanted us to go to war again." He added: "This country has had enough of getting involved in foreign wars."
Mr Clegg, 47, said quitting the EU would threaten jobs. Mr Farage, 50 today, said Britain will never control immigration if we stay in.
He told his rival: "We need to build a house every seven minutes just to cope with immigration You don't believe in this country, and this country's ability to govern ourselves." Last night 100 per cent of Ukip voters said Mr Farage won the debate — along with 33 per cent of Lib Dem backers and 77 per cent of the Tories.
QLIB DEM president Tim Farron yesterday challenged Nick Clegg by calling for the "bedroom tax" to be axed.
