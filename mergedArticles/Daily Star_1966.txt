DAILY STAR Says..
AN astonishing 150,000 foreign workers pay just Â£1 a week in tax, a study has revealed.
The immigrants make the paltry net contribution after raking in hundreds of pounds a week in benefits.
MigrationWatch say it rubbishes claims that migrants always pay their way. We would have to agree.
Ordinary, hard-working UK families are being shafted.
Brit taxpayers are essentially footing the bill for thousands of freeloaders who are not pulling their weight.
This has to stop.
We are constantly told immigration is great for our economy but as these figures show this is not the case.
Britain has always welcomed newcomers who are willing to graft and share our values of fair play.
This something-for-nothing freefor-all on offer to anyone who turns up here must end.
