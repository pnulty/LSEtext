A MASSIVE 45,000 Romanians and Bulgarians registered to work in Britain in the first three months of 2014 AFTER controls were lifted on them.
The number of National Insurance numbers issued to workers from the two new eastern EU countries also more than DOUBLED in the year to March - from 29,000 to 65,000 - official statistics also revealed.
Campaigners argued the first full set of figures since border restrictions were lifted on January 1 proved that fears of a new immigration tidal wave were coming true.
The number of people arriving from the rest of Europe also surged by more than a quarter last year, sending net EU immigration spiralling up to 124,000 from 82,000 in 2012.
And total net immigration from everywhere soared to 212,000 for the whole of 2013.
The grim numbers dealt a fresh blow to David Cameron's collapsing pledge to slash figures down to the tens of thousands by the general election.
And they also heaped more pressure on the PM from Tory MPs to toughen his EU renegotiation stance and demand a red line for Britain's borders.
While immigration from the rest of the world FELL by 11,000 in the year ending December 2013, it ROSE by 43,000 from EU countries.
Another set of figures also revealed arrivals from the EU made up a huge chunk of the 603,000 new workers in Britain in the year to March - up 7% from the year before.
Of those, Poles made up 102,000 of them, Italians 42,000, Romanians 47,000 and Bulgarians 18,000.
Migration Watch UK Chairman Sir Andrew Green said: "The number of new Romanian and Bulgarian citizens in the first quarter of this year suggests that our estimate of a 50,000 a year increase in the UK population of these citizens will be broadly correct".
Labour said the latest figures left Mr Cameron's flagship immigration pledge "in shreds".
Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: "They promised 'no ifs, no buts' to get their net migration target down to the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament, and the actual figure is over twice that".
Commons Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz added: "Controlling EU migration is impossible without reform".
Ministers insisted immigration is still down by a third since its peak in 2005 under Labour.
The Coalition's reforms have also cut net migration from outside the EU to levels "not seen since the late 1990s".
Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: "We are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and addressing the factors that drive European immigration to Britain".
Germany is also dealing with significant new immigration tidal wave, it emerged.
Net immigration there rose to 437,000 - double the UK's numbers - because its economy is attracting people from struggling EU countries.
