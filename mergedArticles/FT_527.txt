The government's plan to cut net migration will damage Britain's economy, weaken the public finances and reduce people's take-home pay, according to research to be presented today, writes Sarah O'Connor .
The paper, which will be presented at the Royal Economic Society's annual conference in Manchester, concludes there would be "strong negative effects on the economy" if the government achieved its target to cut annual net migration to the "tens of thousands".
The research, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, is likely to fuel the UK's heated political debate about the costs and benefits of immigration.
The Conservative party has taken an increasingly tough stance on the issue, which pollsters see as an attempt to counter the danger posed by Nigel Farage's populist UK Independence party ahead of May's European and local elections.
Researchers modelled two potential scenarios: one where net migration remained at its current level of about 200,000 per year for the next 50 years and one where it fell to about half that level, in line with the Conservative party's target. By 2060, the level of gross domestic product in the "low migration" scenario was 11 per cent lower than in the "baseline" scenario, the researchers said. GDP per person was 2.7 per cent lower.
