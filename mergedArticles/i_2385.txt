A Polish MP who came to the UK in a bid to help tackle his country's emigration problem by discovering why it is so popular with his compatriots has reported that he has found it "friendly" but expensive.
Artur Debski arrived earlier this month to live as a migrant and said he quickly found it was "not possible" to survive in London on a budget of £100 per week. He told the BBC that Britain had a "friendly image" that attracted businesses and people, while praising the London Underground as "very good".
Visiting a job centre, Mr Debski observed that the process was slow and unsuccessful for jobseeking migrants, so instead asked a Polish person for a list of employers to call, and secured a job with a building firm, renovating an office in Harrow.
