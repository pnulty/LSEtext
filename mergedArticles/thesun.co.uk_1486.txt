The PM said Nepalese born Gita Lima had done a "fantastic job" and fitted the description of someone who "worked hard and wanted to get on".
And he rubbished suggestions that he helped her secure her British citizenship. Speaking at a press conference in Israel yesterday, he said: "She did once ask me one of the questions in her exam, what is the role of the British cabinet.
"I wont share the answer I gave but I'll leave you to speculate in the way you normally do."
The comments came as an Ipsos poll today revealed 69 per cent of the population feel the Government has not been open and honest about the scale of immigration into the country.
A row over the PM's home help erupted last week when Immigration minister James Brokenshire said the "wealthy metropolitan elite" were the only ones to benefit from the flood of cheap labour into Britain.
The PM refused yesterday to comment on claims the Government he little chance of hitting its key pledge of bringing net migration down to tens of thousands by 2015.
Numbers last month showed net migration soared nearly 40 per cent to 212,000 in the past year - because of rising numbers of EU migrants.
The PM instead boasted of the Government's success in bringing down migrants from non-EU by a third to the lowest levels since 1998. He said: "We have a clear position on immigration, which is that it has been too high and needs to come down."
The Sun yesterday revealed immigration has cost Britain ﾂ｣148billion in the past two decades.
