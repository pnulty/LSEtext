We Need New Names by NoViolet Bulawayo (Vintage, 289pp £7.99 * £7.59, e-book £9.49) Ten-year-old Darling lived with her parents in a house in Zimbabwe. It was bulldozed by the government and she's now one of a pack of kids in a shanty town called Paradise. Her father has gone to South Africa to find work, and comes back only to die of Aids. Her 11-year-old friend is pregnant. This story is shocking, often heartbreaking — but also pulsing with energy. Darling and her friends dream of escaping to Europe or America. And suddenly, Darling really is in America. Bulawayo conveys the culture shock brilliantly. Kate Saunders Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (4th Estate, 477pp £8.99 * £8.54, e-book £8.99) Adichie has chosen to look at the subject head-on, to do what her writer character declares is impossible to do in America, to write "an honest novel about race". She has done so with guts and lustre, and she has done it within the context of a well-crafted, compassionate, visceral and delicately funny tale of lasting high-school love and the sorrows and adventures of immigration.
