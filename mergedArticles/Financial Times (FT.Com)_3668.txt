The level of long-term migration to the UK barely changed last year - underlining the coalition government's failure to carry out its pledge to cut immigration.
Official statistics showed that net migration to the UK - the number of people arriving, minus those emigrating - rose to 212,000 in the year to December, from 177,000 the previous year. The figures were unchanged from the previous quarterly findings.
Labour seized on the new data, saying the government's policy was "in shreds".
Net migration has shown an increase from 154,000 in 2012 - which was the lowest since 2003. But over the past two years, the pattern "has continued to be lower than the general level of net migration since 2004", said the Office for National Statistics.
James Brokenshire, immigration and security minister, said the figures showed that migration had fallen by a third since its peak in 2005, under the previous government, "and that this government's reforms have cut net migration from outside the EU to levels not seen since the late 1990s".
However, Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, said: "David Cameron and [home secretary] Theresa May's flagship immigration pledge is in shreds."
They had promised to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands by the end of the current parliament, yet "the actual figure is over twice [their target]", she said.
Ms Cooper added: "Just 18 months ago, the home secretary claimed she would meet her target. Just a week ago, the prime minister claimed meeting the target was 'perfectly feasible'. But they have no policies to deliver it, and the public know there is a huge gap between Tory rhetoric and the reality."
The data came on a day when the UK Independence party - which campaigns against EU immigration - was expected to perform strongly in European and local elections.
Mark Hilton, head of immigration policy at the London First business group, said the figures had again demonstrated that EU migrants were driving immigration, "and there's nothing we can do about that".
Taking aim at George Osborne, he said that while the chancellor had claimed it was "the left and the populist right" who wanted to "pull up the drawbridge and shut Britain off from the world", the immigration target sent out precisely that message.
A total of 526,000 people migrated to the UK in the year ending December 2013 - and 314,000 emigrated - compared with 498,000 arrivals the previous year. The data show that 43,000 more EU citizens and 11,000 fewer non-EU citizens migrated to the UK than in the previous year.
The number migrating from Romania and Bulgaria - who have been allowed to work without restrictions across the EU since January - rose to 23,000 in the year ending December 2013, compared with 9,000 the previous year.
In the 12 months ending March 2014, work visas issued increased by 10 per cent, with skilled work visas up 18 per cent.
Study visas also rose - by 6 per cent - and student visitor visas rose by 14 per cent, although this rise was partly offset by a 4 per cent fall in family visas, said the ONS.
There was a 5 per cent increase in asylum applications in the year ending March 2014 compared with the previous 12 months, although the numbers remain well below the peak of 84,132 reached in 2002.
