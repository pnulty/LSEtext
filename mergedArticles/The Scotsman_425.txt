ATTENTION was focused yesterday on how two passengers managed to board the aircraft using stolen passports.
Interpol has long sounded the alarm as growing international travel has underpinned a new market for identity theft.
Bogus passports are mostly used by illegal immigrants, but also anyone looking to travel unnoticed, such as drug runners or terrorists.
More than one billion times last year, travellers boarded planes without their passports being checked against Interpol's database of 40 million stolen or lost travel documents, the police agency said.
A European diplomat in Kuala Lumpur said the Malaysian capital was an Asian hub for illegal migrants, many of whom used false documents and complex routes including via Beijing or West Africa to reach a final destination in Europe.
"You shouldn't automatically think that the fact there were two people on the plane with false passports had anything to do with the disappearance of the plane," the diplomat said.
