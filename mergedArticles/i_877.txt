One of Europe's largest detention centres is facing the prospect of an internal revolt after hundreds of its detainees threatened to renew a hunger strike in protest against rules that leave them locked up while their asylum application is processed. Harmondsworth, near Heathrow airport in west London, holds 615 detainees and is run by the GEO Group. On Friday more than 100 detainees staged a demonstration, threatening to starve themselves amid growing anger over the Government's fasttrack asylum procedure which involves immigration officers making an initial decision within two weeks while an asylum seeker is in detention. Campaigners argue that it often leads to rushed and unfair decisions as applicants are left with insufficient time to gather evidence.
The demonstration is understood to have been sparked by a broken fax machine that many were relying on to mount their appeals.
Campaigners say that they opted to suspend their hunger strike over the weekend after they were told of a meeting between Home Office officials and detainees scheduled for Tuesday. A Home Office spokesperson said: "Detention remains an essential element in protecting the UK's borders and maintaining an effective immigration control."
