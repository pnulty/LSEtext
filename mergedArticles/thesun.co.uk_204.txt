A UKIP rising star has quit the party after accusing it of "deliberately attracting the racist vote".
In a huge blow for Nigel Farage barely a week before the European elections, Sanya-Jeet Thandi called on other Ukip supporters not to vote for the party.
Ms Thandi, chair of Young Independence London, joined the party when she was 18 and was seen as a Ukip poster girl.
But she said: "The direction in which the party is going is terrifying.
"Ukip has descended into a form of racist populism that I cannot bring myself to vote for.
"This week I decided to leave the party and I will abstain from voting in the upcoming European elections. I urge other Ukip supporters to do the same."
Ms Thandi said a recent Ukip election billboard warning voters that 26 million unemployed Europeans were after their job had helped to make up her mind.
She said: "Ukip is exploiting the stupidity of ignorant anti-immigrant voters for electoral gain.
"While the party deliberately attracts the racist vote, I refuse to be associated with them."
A Ukip spokesman said: "The trend of our party membership is sharply upwards - it's growing by 500 a week."
