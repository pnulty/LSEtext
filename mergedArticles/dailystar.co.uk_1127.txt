A DESPERATE Afghan migrant who tried to sail to England on a raft made of six planks of wood and a bed sheet was saved by French coastguards after becoming stranded in the English channel.
The 23-year-old was suffering with hypothermia when rescuers found him where he told them he would do anything to "start a new life" in England.
Reports say the youngster was being blown closer to French shores as he struggled with choppy conditions on his way to Britain.
Wearing jeans, a blue hoodie and a wooly hat, the migrant was soaked right through after being spotted on his wooden raft, fitted with tarpaulin, a table leg and a white sheet at around 2pm on Monday.
Officials fear that those who attempt to come to England in this way would normal die.
Bernard Barron, head of local coastal rescue operations
Bernard Barron, head of local coastal rescue operations, believed he would have never made it to England on his makeshift raft.
He said: "He was upset at being caught to begin with, but was then very happy to be safe.
"Because of the very strong winds and currents, it would have been impossible for him to get to Britain, even in a rowing boat.
"If the wind had risen, or the raft had collided with a ferry, then the raft would have capsized and the man would have died."
It was reported in December than up to 40 immigrants every day are trying to cross the channel from Calais in large groups.
But because the man travelled by himself, officials do not believe he is part of the hundreds of non-EU migrants from the camp yards around Calais' port.
More than 600 still wait for their moment to attempt to cross the channel to the British Isles.
