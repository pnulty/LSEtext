Visas giving the right to settle in Britain could be auctioned off to the highest bidders under proposals expected to be unveiled today by the government's official immigration advisers.
The suggestion, expected from the home secretary's migration advisory committee, has been criticised by immigration lawyers for creating an "eBay culture" for permanent UK residence.
Under the proposal overseas millionaires will be invited to bid for investor or tier one UK visas which allow holders and their families to live indefinitely in Britain. A second option would allow visas to be "bought" through donations to hospitals or universities. The existing route lets rich individuals accelerate the process of being allowed to settle in the UK by between two and five years depending on how much is invested.
Professor Sir David Metcalf, chairman of the migration advisory committee, has told MPs it is time to think more creatively about the operation of the investor visa route. "It may very well be that we should be auctioning some of these slots," he told the Commons home affairs select committee. "It may well be that we should be letting people in if they endow a Cambridge college, a major teaching hospital or the London School of Economics with pounds 10m," he added.
Nick Rollason of the Kingsley Napley law firm has warned that an auction of investors' visas would create an "eBay culture" for visas that would leave a bad taste in the mouth of the British public. Alan Travis
