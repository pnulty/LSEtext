THREE people have been charged with an identity card scam following an investigation by the Sunday Mirror.
Police and immigration officers seized the suspects in two planned raids and earlier this week.
A 39-year-old man of Eccles, Manchester, a 36-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman, of Preston, Lancs, have been remanded in custody to appear at Preston Crown Court later this month charged with possession or control of an identity document with improper intent.
Government Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire praised our investigation. He said: "I am grateful to the Sunday Mirror for helping to uncover evidence of suspected dealing in false documents.
"The arrests show that we will take swift and robust action when suspected immigration crime is brought to our attention."
