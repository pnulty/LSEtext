DAVID Cameron yesterday dodged demands for Britain to regain full control of its borders from the European Union.
The PM, launching the Tory European election campaign in Manchester, said he wanted to stop "vast migrations" from new EU states. That stops short of meeting The Sun's demand to claw back all immigration controls from Brussels. The PM also attacked Ukip "extremists", with polls hinting the Tories could come third for the first time in a national poll. Mr Cameron said Ukip MEPs rarely vote and could not be trusted to stand up for Britain.
