TWO people thought to be immigrants being deported were feared dead last night after jumping from a ferry into the North Sea in a bid to get back to Britain.
Stena Line said that two passengers were believed to have jumped off a vessel which left Harwich bound for the Hook of Holland yesterday.
Thames Coastguard began a search after being alerted to the disappearance, around 9.45am, from the Stena Britannica which was approximately one mile off the Essex coast.
A spokesman said: "A thorough search of the area has been carried out but nothing found. Unless new information comes to light, search and rescue units have now been stood down."
Felixstowe and Shingle Street Coastguard Rescue Teams, two RNLI lifeboats from Harwich, the Walton RNLI lifeboat and the search and rescue helicopter from RAF Wattisham had been sent to the scene.
