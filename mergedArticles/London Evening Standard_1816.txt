FORMER New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's comments on immigration come at an important time. Yesterday Ukip launched a series of election posters targeting fear of immigration. One reads, "26 million people in Europe are looking for work And whose jobs are they after?", with a finger pointing at the reader. Mr Bloomberg, chairman of the Serpentine Gallery, takes a very different line: "We definitely need immigrants and that's exactly true of London and the whole of the UK in particular."
Mr Bloomberg is right. London, like New York, has benefited enormously from immigration — indeed the inflow of newcomers is an intrinsic part of it being an open world city. A new study predicts that the City will create 41,000 new jobs over the next decade: in terms of nationality, it is one of the most diverse workforces in the country, drawing in talent from across the whole world. Of course immigration can also present challenges: it can increase pressure on public services and housing. But the answer is to meet such practical challenges while reaping the economic rewards of immigration — not to stop it.
At present, the British debate remains constrained by the reluctance of politicians in all three major parties to be clear about migration's benefits. Yet as the Tories have found with their pledge to cut net immigration below 100,000 by 2015, which they have virtually no chance of meeting, drastic cuts to immigration, especially from Europe, are not practicable in any case. Mr Bloomberg's international perspective is valuable: world cities like his, and London, show the way on immigration.
