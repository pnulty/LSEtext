BRITAIN must build two new cities the size of Leeds to house 1.4million migrants in the next seven years.
By 2012 new arrivals will need 629,000 of the 2.2m households predicted to be created in the UK.
The House Of Commons library study will heap more pressure on David Cameron to restrict soaring migrant numbers.
Experts warned such large migration would send house prices and rents rocketing, forcing many British nationals into social housing.

MigrationWatch vice-chairman Alp Mehmet said: “Mass migration will have an impact on house prices. If demand goes up while supply remains stationary, prices will rise."
And Oxford University Migration Observatory researcher Carlos Vargas-Silva said: “British nationals may end up going into social housing because the price of rent is too high."
Around 1.8m migrants have arrived since 2004, hitting an annual high of 250,000 in 2010. Migrants have taken 795,000 households since then.
Tory MP James Clappison, who requested the Offi ce For National Statistics research, said: “Labour pursued an open-door immigration policy and gave no thought to the consequences."
