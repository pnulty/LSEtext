GRAVITY
From Monday, Sky Store
Just how many Oscars will this brilliant movie win on Sunday night? Don't worry If you missed it at the cinema, because on Monday, you can watch it from the comfort of your own living room. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock play astronauts trapped in space - and the effects will have you gawping.
THE PRODUCERS

Director Tim Burton's comedy, which stars Winona Ryder, sees recently dead couple Adam and Barbara get help from a ghost (Michael Keaton) to scare away a yuppie family who have bought their old home - but he's more trouble than he's worth.
THE PROPOSAL
Friday, 10.35pm, BBC1
Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock prove to be a great comedy couple in this story of a Canadian publishing editor who is facing deportation from the United States, so she begs her assistant to marry her and convince an immigration official that they are a couple for real.
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY
Friday, 10.55pm, Film4
It's the film that spawned the phrase 'gross-out', and it's not hard to see why - with unusual hair gel substitutes, things caught in trouser flies and genital-munching border terriers. Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon and Lee Evans star.
