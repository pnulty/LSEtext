International human rights organisations were last night demanding that Home Secretary Theresa May step in to prevent a Nigerian "witch-hunter" returning to the UK after preaching to congregations in London.
"Lady Apostle" Helen Ukpabio (inset), founder of the controversial Liberty Foundation Gospel Ministries, is believed to still be in the capital after addressing three gatherings last week. The born-again Christian Pentecostal preacher claims to have been betrothed to Satan as a teenager before being rescued from a cult. She now specialises in liberating captives in "deliverance sessions" that critics claim are little more than crude exorcisms which exploit local superstitions about witchcraft. Among her advice to parents is the suggestion: "If a child under the age of two screams in the night, cries and is always feverish with deteriorating health he or she is a servant of Satan."
Campaigners say such beliefs risk childrens' safety and have written to Mrs May urging that the pastor should not be allowed back at the conclusion of the current tour. In the letter, the Witchcraft and Human Rights Information Network (WHRIN), the Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales and the International Humanist and Ethical Union claim that her activities in Nigeria mean the pastor is in breach of the Immigration Act 1971.
Mrs Ukpabio cancelled her first service in south-east London after the location was leaked. She is understood to have made three other appearances including one at a private home. Around a dozen people attended each event which offered to help those "under attack" from witchcraft, ancestral or "mermaid" spirits.
