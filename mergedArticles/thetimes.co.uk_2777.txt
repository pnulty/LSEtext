Net immigration has risen to more than 200,000 in a significant blow to David Cameron who has pledged to reduce it below 100,000 by the next general election.
A surge in migrants from the EU, particularly southern mediterranean countries, helped push up the figures, according to official statistics.
Immigration from Romania and Bulgaria more than doubled in the year to last September with an estimated 70 per cent of the 24,000 arriving coming to work.
The latest migration figures highlight how difficult it is for the Government to reduce the numbers coming to the UK when it has no control over those coming from the EU under free movement rules.
Levels of immigration from the EU countries are at the highest level since 1964, the Office for National Statistics said.
Figures from the Office for National Statistics show net migration — the difference between those arriving and those leaving — rose from 154,000 to 212,000 in the 12 months to September last year.
The number arriving was broadly stable but within the overall figure there was a 60,000 jump in those coming from the EU and a fall in non EU citizens.
Almost 210,000 people from the EU came to the UK — the highest estimate of migration from EU states almost fifty years — including a rise of 40,000 in those coming to work.
More than half of those arriving from the EU came from older member states including big jumps in those coming from Poland, Spain, Italy and Portugal to seek work.
About a third of those coming from the EU were from the eight former Soviet bloc states which joined the EU in 2004 and 12 per cent from Romania and Bulgaria.
National insurance numbers issued to overseas nationals wanting to work confirmed the surge in EU citizens finding jobs in the UK with 440,000 registrations — up by almost 30 per cent in a year.
The number issued to Poles rose by 30 per cent to 111,000 and those to Spaniards jumped by 36 per cent to 51,000, Italians by 66 per cent to 44,000 and to Portuguese by almost fifty per cent to 30,000.
James Brokenshire, the Immigration Minister, said in a statement “We cannot impose formal immigration controls on EU migrants, so we are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and seeking to address the factors that drive European immigration to Britain."
The rise in net migration was caused by a slight increase in immigration to just over half a million and a fall in emigration of 23,000 to 320,000.
Numbers coming to study fell to 176,000 with falls in those coming for non University course with falls in those coming from India and Pakistan as a result of the Government’s drive to tackle abuses such as bogus colleges.
Visa applications for universities rose by seven per cent but there was a fall of more than a third in applications for further education courses and two per cent falls in those applying to come to English language schools and to independent schools.
Dr Scott Blinder, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said: “This is clearly challenging news for the Government. The key changes in this report are to EU migration – an area over which immigration policy has less direct influence. This highlights the fact that the net migration target is not something that can be delivered purely through policy, but relies on other trends as well."
