CONGRATULATIONS to The Evening Standard for organising such a stimulating and civilised debate (News/Comment, March 4) on the subject of immigration. Every panellist had something useful to say and the huge audience underlined just how passionate Londoners are to openly discuss and resolve the great issues of our day. It was an exhilarating evening. Stan Labovitch, Windsor
