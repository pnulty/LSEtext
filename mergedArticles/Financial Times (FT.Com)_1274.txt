From Mr Peter Verstage.
Sir, Reading your report on the sale of UK resident visas to wealthy foreigners ("UK proposes Â£2.5m 'premium' visas", February 26), it seems unfair that I am not allowed to sell my citizenship and right of abode to a foreigner. I have no wish ever to live in the UK again, and I'm sure many others feel the same. Thus the immigration and emigration figures would cancel each other out, and no net immigration would result. As a bonus you get rid of us disaffected folk with all our negative views on the way the country is going.
Peter Verstage, Onchan, Isle of Man
