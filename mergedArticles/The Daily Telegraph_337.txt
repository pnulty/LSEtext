LABOUR has made a "complete hash" of its response to the UK Independence party, a key ally of Ed Miliband has said.
John Denham, a former Cabinet minister and aide to the Labour leader, said his party is failing to respond to the threat from Nigel Farage.
The Ukip leader has said he wants to come first in this month's European elections by winning the support of working–class voters on whom Mr Miliband has "turned his back".
Mr Denham, the former Communities secretary, said: "Are the political parties as a whole, including mine, making a complete hash of their response to Ukip? Yes."
Labour politicians are driving voters to Mr Farage by describing as racist Ukip posters warning that immigrants are taking British jobs, he said.
Mr Denham added: "That's the sort of thing said by somebody whose aim is to mobilise anti–Ukip voters to come out and vote.
"It's not the sort of thing said by a candidate who is actually trying to engage with the voters, because they are the people we need to vote for us."
