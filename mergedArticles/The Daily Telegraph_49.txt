THE BBC risks being accused of political bias by broadcasting a Conservative MP's history of England's links with Scotland ahead of the independence referendum.
Rory Stewart, a half–Scottish, half–English MP, has spoken of his fervent opposition to an independent Scotland in an interview with the Radio Times to publicise his BBC Two film, Border Country: The Story of Britain's Lost Middleland.
"Scottish independence would mean I would have to decide either to be an immigrant with a life outside my own country, or make the more romantic choice of returning to Scotland," he said.
"I really resent the idea of having to choose."
