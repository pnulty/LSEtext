IMMIGRATION to the UK has cost each household £5,600, a study reveals today.
The price of Britain’s open doors policy means taxpayers over 17 years have picked up a bill for £148billion – at more than £22million a day.
The figures emerged after analysis of a controversial university report which tried to claim migrants had added £25billion to the economy.
Sir Andrew Green, chairman of campaign group MigrationWatch UK, which published today’s paper, said: “Our report finally disposes of the immigration lobby’s oft repeated claims that immigration reduces our tax burden.
“The total cost is high and increased dramatically between 1995 and 2011, providing no compensation for the overcrowding of this island which we are experiencing, largely as a result of immigration."
MigrationWatch UK’s findings come as Prime Minister David Cameron faces humiliation over his pledge to cut net migration to the UK to the “tens of thousands".
Figures from the Office for National Statistics show arrivals last year outstripped those leaving by 212,000 – a massive leap on the 154,000 over the previous 12 months.
The revelations are in a review of a paper by the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration at University College London.
Professor Christian Dustmann and Dr Tommaso Frattini claimed EU migrants paid four per cent more into the tax system than they took, while British-born people paid in seven per cent less. The pair also said migrants arriving between 2001 and 2011 added £25billion to Britain’s economy.
But when MigrationWatch did the sums again with a more realistic approach they found “no positive contribution" by European migrants between 2001 and 2011. The actual cost to the UK of all migrants between 1995 and 2011 stood at £148billion.
The annual bill rocketed from around £7billion in 2003 – a year before Poland, Slovakia and eight other countries joined the EU – to about £22billion in 2011 after Romania and Bulgaria won membership, according to MigrationWatch estimates.
While migrants were half as likely as natives to claim benefits they were “much more likely" to get tax credits – costing the state more – to make up for low pay.
MigrationWatch experts also found the academics had buried a figure showing that, even using their hopelessly optimistic calculations, the full cost of immigration stood at nearly £100billion.
“The authors themselves found a cost to the UK from migrants in the UK of £95billion between 1995 and 2011.
“This result can be found only...at the end of their paper; the figure is not mentioned in their text and...furthermore, their findings show a net cost every year," MigrationWatch found. The academics said in reply: “MigrationWatch’s main criticism is based on a stark misapprehension of our methodology.
“The report is written in a derogatory language seemingly attempting to undermine our reputation.
“We welcome constructive criticism of our work, and we have engaged responsively and transparently with outside researchers who have raised criticisms since we believe that only an open and fact-based debate can do justice to a subject as sensitive as immigration."
