TUESDAY: Ukip launched its posters displaying a giant pointing finger with the slogan: '26 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?' Critics branded the poster racist and warned it was scaremongering about immigration.
WEDNESDAY: Nigel Farage was left embarrassed after it emerged a woman portrayed as a Ukip voter in Devon was actually his assistant Lizzy Vaid. The leader was also left squirming after he was asked by the BBC whether his German wife, who works for him, had 'stolen' a British job.
THURSDAY: It emerges that council candidate Andre Lampitt, a builder who featured in a party election broadcast, had tweeted a string of controversial messages about Islam, slavery and Africa. He was suspended after declaring that Ed Miliband was 'not a real Brit' and suggesting people should 'get over' slavery.
FRIDAY: David Challice, a leading party activist in the South West, is exposed for posting sexist comments about working women and for placing an advertisement advising 'cash-strapped' Muslims of a 'potential moneyspinner' - to take multiple wives for benefits. It is also revealed that the hard-up 'British builder' who had complained of losing work to cheaper EU labour was actually Irish actor Dave O'Rourke.
