BY his own admission David Cameron has failed to curb soaring immigration.
As long as our borders are open to the EU that will remain so — no matter who's in Downing Street.
We hope the major parties no longer pretend this isn't a burning issue. In our latest poll it's at the top, alongside the economy.
Ukip followers delude themselves that Nigel Farage alone wants to do anything about it. But only the Tories trust voters enough to pledge a referendum on Europe. Cameron has now staked his future on it.
On Pages 18 and 19, Farage cheekily offers to form a Government with the Tories next May to force the EU vote through.
But there's a problem there.
If Ukip do win Westminster seats and their vote is strong, they'll have wrecked Tory chances in key marginals which decide the election.
There won't be a potential Tory Government to make a deal with.
It's a paradox that Mr Cameron is Ukip's only hope of achieving their dream — and the man they are most likely to destroy.
