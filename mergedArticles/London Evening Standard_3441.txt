THE amount of time it takes to deport a foreign criminal has leapt by almost a third since the coalition took power, Labour claimed today.
It said latest Home Office figures showed it now took more than six months to ship a foreign offender out of the UK â€” in 2010 there were 143 days between a deportation order and an offender being kicked out, but by 2013 this had increased to 187 days.
Ministers denied criminals were staying in the country longer and claimed the rise occurred because they were securing orders earlier in the deportation process.
The statistics come on the eve of European elections in which immigration is a key issue, with Ukip surging towards possible victory.
Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: "The Government's failure to remove people even after they've ordered their deportation is inexcusable." Labour also claimed fewer offenders were being deported now, with 4,667 in 2013 against 5,342 in 2009. But Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said offenders were not remaining longer.
