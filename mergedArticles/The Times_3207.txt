Bosses employing large numbers of migrant workers on less than the minimum wage face being jailed under proposals to be revealed by Labour today. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, plans to toughen penalties to tackle businesses exploiting workers. She will also announce that Labour plans to set a minimum jail term for anyone found employing large numbers of illegal immigrants. Ms Cooper will say that much tougher action is needed to stop employers hiring cheap migrant labour to undercut wages, jobs and responsible businesses.
In a speech in London she will also say that illegal immigrants caught in Calais should have their fingerprints taken so that further action can be taken if they try to re-enter the UK. She will repeat that the last Labour government got things wrong on immigration.
