Illegal immigrants, guns and drugs are arriving in Britain on light aircraft landing on rural airstrips or in fields, the National Crime Agency has warned.
Criminal gangs and terrorists are using non–passenger flights to slip into the UK away from large airports where security measures are concentrated, it is feared.
According to the crime agency, there are almost 3,000 sites in the UK where the country's 20,000 small aircraft can land, including aerodromes, small airfields, farmers' field strips and helipads. It said organised criminals and terrorists use the aviation sector for crimes ranging from illegal immigration, importing hard drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines, and trafficking firearms.
The NCA is asking farmers and airstrip operators to look out for planes that are "covered in mud" when only Tarmac strips are listed on their flight plans. Aircraft that stay "very briefly" at foreign destinations should also be reported, it said.
Planes that regularly suffer minor damage, and those modified to increase range or load, should also be monitored, it added.
