BRITAIN pulling out of the European Union is "like Scotland pulling out of the UK", Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg claimed as he and Nigel Farage traded insults in the second televised debate on Europe.
Mr Farage came out on top in a Yougov poll by 68 per cent to 27 per cent - a bigger margin than the first debate which was 56 per cent, 37 per cent.
The Ukip leader appealed to voters watching the BBC News debate to join a "people's army" to get Britain back again after it had "been given away through lies and deceit".
He claimed that Mr Clegg had "wilfully lied" over his claims that only 7 per cent of the UK's laws were made in the EU.
Mr Clegg hit back by saying that Mr Farage had "made up" facts to support his case.
The Deputy Prime Minister also produced a Ukip leaflet with a picture of a Native American saying: "He ignored immigration now he lives in a reservation."
