PASSENGERS flying into Manchester Airport faced huge queues and delays as they tried to pass through immigration.
More than 1,000 passengers waited almost an hour at terminal three from 7.30am yesterday morning.
The Border Force (BF) said that the immigration desks were all manned but a combination of early and late arrivals caused a 'bottleneck'.
Two flights were delayed by around 15 minutes, while another arrival was 20 minutes early, causing one thousand passengers to arrive in a much shorter period than expected.
A Chicago flight came in at 8.06am rather than 7.50am, a Paris shuttle arrived at 8.16am rather than 7.50am and the Gerona plane arrived at 8.54am rather than 9.15am. The queues were dealt with by around 9.30am.
A BF spokesman said: "There were queues for a short period at Manchester Airport caused by the late arrival of busy flights coinciding with the early arrival of another.
"Border Force deployed staff to deal with the queues and reduce disruption for passengers, while ensuring the necessary checks took place. "We are working with Manchester Airport to try and resolve issues around flight timings to ensure we provide an excellent service to legitimate travellers, as well as securing the border."
However, M.E.N. Twitter followers responded to the delays saying it was a regular occurrence.
Tommy posted: "Happens all the time especially terminal 3".
