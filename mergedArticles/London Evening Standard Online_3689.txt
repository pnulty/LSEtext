A man gave a Nazi salute and shouted "Heil Hitler" outside a north London kosher restaurant at Jewish diners marking Holocaust Remembrance Day.
Miroslav Ondrus, 33, marched up to three men eating at the White House Express in Golders Green and performed the offensive gesture, Hendon magistrates' court heard.
The Slovakian also picked up restaurant manager Solomon Tangi after he protested about his behaviour and shook him violently, injuring his wrist.
District Judge Mark Jabbitt branded Ondrus "outrageous" as he banned him from entering the NW11 postcode area or a year.
He also ordered the restaurant worker, who had been drinking nearby, to do 180 hours of community service.
Judge Jabbitt told Ondrus: "What you did was profoundly insulting and threatening.‚Äù
Ondrus, of Wimbledon, south-west London, admitted two charges of racially or religiously aggravated harassment and a charge of assault by beating.
Tina Patel, defending, said the remorseful immigrant "could not be more apologetic" and was so drunk at the time he "can't remember anything".
