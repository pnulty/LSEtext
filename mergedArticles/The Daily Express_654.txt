DECEITFUL propaganda is the weapon of the fanatical proimmigration brigade. Desperate to foist their ideology on a reluctant public they trumpet the diligence of all new arrivals, without whose hard work our economy and public services would supposedly collapse.
The emptiness of that claim has been exposed by shocking new figures obtained by this paper. These show that in February 2013 no fewer than 397,000 immigrants were living off benefits provided by the taxpayer, a phenomenal increase of 110,000 in five years.
That rise makes a mockery of the sanctimonious rhetoric in favour of unrestricted free movement and open borders. The truth, as today's statistics demonstrate, is that many foreigners who come here are freeloaders eager to exploit our absurdly generous benefits.
The ease with which migrants can claim social security is profoundly damaging to our country. First, it is completely unaffordable, especially since our welfare bill is already more than Â£220billion. Second, it destroys the welfare contract: support is meant to be based on past payments of tax and national insurance. By definition newly arrived migrants have made no contribution to our society.
A simple solution would be to bar all migrants from claiming benefits until they had paid tax for at least five years but sadly, given the feebleness of our political class combined with the despotism of the EU, there is no sign of that happening. So we will have to keep on subsidising scroungers.
