A group of Tory backbenchers will this week urge David Cameron to tone down his rhetoric on immigration and will criticise the "arbitrary" pledge to bring down net migration to the tens of thousands.
The new group, Conservatives for Managed Migration, will call on the leadership to stop its obsession with reducing immigration in growing efforts to "outdo" Ukip.
Mark Field, a Tory MP leading the group, said efforts to bring down numbers of foreign students were damaging because they discouraged talented students who would be good for the economy. He told Sky News: "We went into the last election with a bit of a frenzy about immigration across the political divide, therefore came up with this idea of net migration figures. The trouble with net migration figures is there's so little control over it."
Weekend reports suggested the European commission may announce legal action within weeks against Britain over its efforts to limit benefits to EU citizens.
Meanwhile a report from the Lords' EU committee will today call for a new system that would allow groups of member countries to propose and more easily veto legislation brought forward by the commission on grounds of proportionality.
