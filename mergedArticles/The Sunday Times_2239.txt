DAVID CAMERON was facing questions last night about the immigration status of his children's nanny when he first employed her.
Downing Street declined to say if Gita Lima, who is from Nepal, had a valid visa to live and work in Britain when she was taken on by Cameron.
Lima was recruited by the prime minister and his wife, Samantha, through the charity Kalayaan, which advises foreign cleaners and nannies on their right to work in the UK and helps those who suffer abuse from employers.
She was given a British passport in 2010, before which she is believed to have been employed on an overseas domestic workers' visa that is renewed annually.
No 10 has refused to say if Lima had such a visa when she was initially employed.
While there is no suggestion that the Camerons have broken any rules and No 10 has insisted "the correct processes had been followed", the questions come just days after James Brokenshire, the new immigration minister, appeared to criticise the "wealthy metropolitan elite" who employ immigrants for "cheap labour".
Domestic workers can apply for indefinite leave to remain after they have been in the UK for five years on a visa. The Camerons are believed to have applied for the visa annually.
Yesterday Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, defended his employment of a Portuguese cleaner and accused the Tories of opening a "poisonous" debate about immigration.
Spring is near: time, says the minister, to ethnically cleanse your house, Camilla Cavendish, page 21
