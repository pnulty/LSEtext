THE population of Scotland reached a record high of almost 5.33million last year.
The rise was fuelled by more people coming to live in the country from the rest of the UK and further afield.
There were also about 910 more births than deaths, the National Records of Scotland (NRS) statistics show.
Net immigration figures were higher for people from elsewhere in the UK than from overseas for the first time in nearly a decade.
The NRS estimate the total population was 5,327,700 in mid-2013, a rise of 14,100 from the previous year.
For the tenth year in a row, more people moved to Scotland than left to live elsewhere. There was a net increase of about 9,960 between mid-2012 and mid-2013. The figures are based on data from the 2011 census.
NRS chief executive Tim Ellis said: 'Scotland's population increased primarily because of a net inflow of approximately 10,000 more people coming to Scotland than leaving, although there were also around 900 more births than deaths.
'However, for the first time in nine years, net migration from the rest of the UK was larger than that from overseas.' Approximately 47,700 people moved to Scotland frome the rest of the UK with 39,800 going in the opposite direction.
Around 28,200 overseas immigrants came to Scotland, while 26,100 people from Scotland moved abroad.
