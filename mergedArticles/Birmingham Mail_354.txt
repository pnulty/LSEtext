THE EU enthusiasts who keep telling us of the dangers of Britain leaving the expensive club never tell us of the benefits of our membership, for there aren't any.
It costs us Â£53 per day, most of it going to poorer countries. No wonder they don't want Britain to leave.
When the European Economic Union was formed in 1956, it was said to be for free trade only - no mention of each country surrendering its sovereign.
There was no mention of the free flow of labour which means uncontrollable immigration which means unemployment which could mean civil unrest.
If Britain left the EU she could still export to those counties still in the union.
