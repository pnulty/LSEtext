THE mother of a black teenager stabbed to death in an unprovoked racist attack 21 years ago has said it is an 'abomination' that the fight against intolerance continues.
Baroness Lawrence told a conference on hate crime in Edinburgh yesterday that although there has been some progress over the last 20 years 'stark inequalities' still exist.
She stressed it is not only black and ethnic minority groups that experience prejudice, with white immigrants also targeted.
Baroness Lawrence's son Stephen, 18, was stabbed by a group of up to six white youths at a bus stop in south-east London in 1993.
It took 19 years to convict just two of the men involved. Baroness Lawrence said people from all backgrounds must work together to pursue the 'dignity of difference'.
She said: 'When we talk about hate crime, we are not just talking about the experience of black and minority ethnic groups.
'We are also talking about the experiences of white groups, yet this is something we as a society still do not acknowledge or discuss. More than 20 years after Stephen's murder, it is an abomination that we should still be fighting against intolerance.' The baroness added: 'Communities should work together to raise awareness of the suffering of others. Similarity is what unites us and difference is what enriches us.'
