The exploitation of migrant workers in a bid to undercut wages would be made a criminal offence under a Labour government, the shadow home secretary will say today. Yvette Cooper will also propose minimum custodial sentences for wholesale employment of illegal immigrants.
The measures are designed to reassure British workers that immigrant labour will not be used to undercut their wages but the specific proposal is legally fraught since employers will be concerned that it could give the state greater control over the setting of wages in the private sector.
The current law on forced labour requires an element of coercion or deception between the defendant and the victim, such as unwarranted deductions from wages, poor accommodation provided by the employer, the employer not paying the full tax or national insurance contributions for the worker.
In a speech today Cooper will say: "The truth is that for too long exploitation in the labour market - a cause and effect of low-skilled immigration and illegal immigration - has gone unchecked."
She will also commit to introduce proper exit checks as part of UK border policy. Cooper will also admit that "the last Labour government got things wrong on immigration. We should have had transitional controls in place for eastern Europe. The figures were wrong, and migration was far greater than we expected. As a result ,the pace and scale of immigration was too great and it is right to bring it down."
