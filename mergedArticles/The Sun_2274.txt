England border controls fear
BORDER posts may have to be introduced on the British mainland if Scotland votes to go it alone, MPs say.
It could mean travellers having to show their passports to cross over from Scotland into England.
The warning comes as a report says an independent Scotland would need an influx of immigrants to balance the books. Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas bank say Scotland will not be able to pay for its pensions because of its ageing population. It recommends: "Encouraging inward immigration would be essential."
The Scottish National Party insists border checks will not be needed if Scots vote for independence in September's referendum, with First Minister Alex Salmond saying the "common travel area" would continue.
But MPs with constituencies near the border yesterday told The Sun that controls would be unavoidable if thousands of immigrants move to Scotland.
Former Scottish Secretary Michael Moore, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: "You either have similar immigration policies, or you have border controls."
Berwick MP Sir Alan Beith said: "If the UK government believed Scotland was letting in people who could pose a danger, it might be necessary to exercise some controls. That would mean passport checks."
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael meanwhile promised to give Scotland more powers if it votes to stay in the UK. kevin.
