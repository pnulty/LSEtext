Officials are investigating a computer glitch that left airline passengers queuing for up to four hours to clear immigration (Philip Pank writes).
The failure meant that passport control staff had to validate the identity of passengers manually, provoking disruption and even violence at the busiest airports.
James Brokenshire, the immigration and security minister, said: "We apologise for the delays, but security must remain our priority. I visited Heathrow and have asked technical staff to ensure lessons are learnt."
Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said security may have been compromised during the computer meltdown.
Long queues developed at Heathrow and Gatwick on Wednesday night. Chris Hyland from Islington, north London, said: "We landed from Geneva at 5.20pm but it took until 6.40pm for us to get through passport control. You'd have thought there would be a back-up plan."
A Heathrow passenger said: "There were people there who had come off 18-hour flights, very tired, and obviously it was pretty unpleasant."
Passengers with passports from countries outside the EU endured the longest waits.
The IT systems were back up and running yesterday.
