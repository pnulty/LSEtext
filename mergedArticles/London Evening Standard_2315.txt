UKIP was to hold a carnival-style event in London today to help show it has candidates from all backgrounds.
The event complete with steel drums, musicians and other performers was aimed to show that the party is campaigning in a "bold and vibrant way".
It comes after leader Nigel Farage was accused of racism for making comments about Romanian immigrants.
Days before EU Parliament elections this week, he said in an interview on LBC Radio: "I was asked if a group of Romanian men moved in next to you, would you be concerned? And if you lived in London, I think you would be."
The leader later backtracked by saying he was "tired out" and did not use the "form of words" he would have liked to.
