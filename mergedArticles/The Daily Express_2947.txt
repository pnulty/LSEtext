EU migrants coming to the UK are set to outnumber arrivals from the rest of the world combined.
Booming numbers moving to Britain from debt-ridden countries in southern and eastern Europe are expected to top the 250,000 mark for the first time.
Meanwhile, the number entering the country from outside the EU is predicted to fall below the quarter of a million mark.
The startling figures will be confirmed when official immigration figures for 2013 are published at the end of the month.
They will heap more pressure on Prime Minister David Cameron who vowed to slash net migration - the number entering the country minus those leaving - to the "tens of thousands" by the end of next year.
Campaign group MigrationWatch chairman, Sir Andrew Green, said: "We must achieve a significant reduction."
Ukip MEP Gerard Batten said: "David Cameron is powerless to deliver on his promise to cut migration because of the open borders policy. We have to cut our ties with the EU and take back control over our own borders."
