BRITAIN'S immigration crisis continues to deepen as a direct result of EU membership. It is now being predicted that official figures to be released at the end of the month will show that immigration from EU member states has outstripped arrivals from the rest of the world combined.
It is not difficult to understand why that is. EU citizens can move to this country whenever they like with no restrictions. Thanks to the strictures imposed by Brussels our politicians are powerless to stem this flow.
Immigrants coming from outside the EU remain subject to British border controls meaning we can in theory ensure that only migrants who will contribute positively to society can enter and that migration remains at a reasonable level. Indeed migration from outside the EU is dropping.
Being able to impose the same restrictions on EU migrants as we do on migrants from the rest of the world would give the Government a fighting chance of bringing immigrant numbers under control. While we remain a member of the EU David Cameron's pledge of reducing net migration to the "tens of thousands" will never be achieved.
