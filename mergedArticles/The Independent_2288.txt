Comment
In a joint Radio Times interview with Marion Bartoli - whose Wimbledon victory last year he sourced, at the time, to the work ethic she derived from not being a long-legged "looker" in the Maria Sharapova mould - John Inverdale reveals what caused him to make the comment: pollen.
"I was feeling so ill that day," Inverdale ventures. "I had terrible hayfever, and all I could think of was that I wanted to go home to bed." This will be a relief to anyone misled into imagining that the remark was somehow related to his status as a laureate of rugger-bugger sexism.
If Ms Bartoli has forgiven him, so must we all. What cannot be excused is the stab at heroic victimhood. As a top-ranked hypochondriac with a sideline in malingering, I loathe a trouper. If you feel lousy (or exhausted, as Nigel Farage alleges he was when drawing his elegant distinction between Romanian and German immigrants), go to bed and trust the world to muck along without you.
While accepting Inverdale's indispensability to those who like their Wimbledon coverage drenched in smugness, sprinkled with narcissism and garnished with cliché, other BBC presenters could have stepped in at short notice. Some might even have had access to antihistamines, and a better than 50-50 chance of marking the hugely intelligent, enchanting and, for what it's worth, beautiful Bartoli's triumph without Clarksonian reference to her appearance.
