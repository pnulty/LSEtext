I, LIKE many of those on the AAPG panel, was really horrified by what we found.
What was clear from the evidence is that the system is now tilted against family life, unless someone can demonstrate that their spouse who is coming into the UK is desirable in some way and meets some extra criteria.
One of the striking characteristics of the new rules is the complete lack of flexibility.
At no time can an immigration officer look at somebody's case and make a decision based on compassion or common sense.
But why are the rules so rigid and inflexible? It is because income probably has nothing to do with it. It is not really about trying to prevent a burden on the taxpayer. It is actually about the Government trying to demonstrate that we are reducing the number of foreigners coming in.
But the result of trying to look tough is that families are being separated, people are having to live thousands of miles from their loved ones, and British nationals are being forced to leave the country as their Government won't allow them to live with their family in the UK.
Our inquiry showed the rules are inhumane, lacking in common sense, and will do great damage to the country.
