MONSTER muncher Stacey McFarlane has blamed the Government for making her fat by giving her too much benefits cash.
The mum of three said she was left with £400 spare each week from her handouts and blew the lot on grub.
Stacey, 33, eats out up to five times a week and when she stays in pigs out on takeaways.
Her regular lunches with pals while the children are at school involve a three-course meal and "a couple of lagers" for £30.
When she cooks at home she treats her family to the finest fillet steak.
But her taxpayerfunded food fest has seen Stacey balloon to 19 stone.
And she said the blame for her size 24 frame lay solely with the Government.

She moaned: "They give me a fortune in benefits.
"The amount of disposable income I have is probably more than 90% of working people. It's crazy. I spend it on food. I love my food. I'm able to go out five times a week to restaurants.
"These ladies that lunch, most of them have rich husbands who work. I don't, I have benefits."
Stacey pockets £1,800 a month in handouts and the rent on her council home in Rochdale is paid by housing benefit.
She said she started piling on the pounds after son Jamie was born deaf in 2003. Her benefits soared by £800 a month due to his disability.
But she is worried he now shares her love of grub and, aged 11, weighs 10st.
She said: "We're far too big."
