David Cameron has said he is keen to further tighten rules on EU immigration after German proposals to expel migrants who fail to find work.
Downing Street aides confirmed that they would examine the German plan, included in a draft report.
European Commission sources suggested that EU states did have the right to expel migrants after three months if they had failed to find work and could not support themselves.
Ministers announced a series of immigration reforms at the start of the year to head off public concerns and tackle the electoral threat from Ukip, but Mr Cameron has now said that he may go farther.
“We’ll look very closely if the Germans want to take this further,” Mr Cameron told the BBC. “I talked to Angela Merkel personally last week and we are going to work with her, with the Swedish Prime Minister, with the Dutch Prime Minister on how we can tighten up in this area.”
Raoul Ruparel, from the Open Europe think-tank, said Germany had now been “far more explicit” about supporting a major treaty change. “Importantly for David Cameron, it is also the first time that Germany has made it clear treaty change will be on the table in the near future rather than being kicked into the long grass,” he said.
