British kids are disadvantaged DUE to uncontrolled immigration our country is being flooded with thousands of people who have no capabilities or language knowledge to support themselves or families, also numerous more who head straight for medical assistance.
These are cases being reported in schools where there are up to 450 different languages being spoken.
Hence teachers are having to spend 25 per cent of their time trying to communicate with this problem.
Due to this thousands of British-born children are not receiving the full education that is their birthright and are leaving school hardly capable of writing their own name . Richard Smith, Acocks Green
