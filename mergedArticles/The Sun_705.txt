NIGELLA LAWSON has been stopped from getting on a plane to the States because of her reputation for snorting cocaine and smoking cannabis in front of her kids.
God bless America. Nigella flounced into court, chest on high alert - and admitted taking drugs without anyone raising an eyebrow. She has been gushing and crying on chat shows, winning over the nation with her talk of eating chocolate late at night. Most women have every sympathy for the self-styled domestic goddess.
I have none. The Americans have the sort of strict immigration and passport controls we need to adopt here. If you aren't good enough, you aren't coming in.
Nigella has lived a blessed life yet took drugs in front of her kids. If she was a single mum living on an estate do we really think anyone would be quite so sympathetic?
