HOW many organisations can one man be "editor-at-large" of ? David Goodhart appears to be testing the limits. He founded Prospect magazine and edited it until 2011, becoming its editor-at-large. Now, after two years as director of think-tank Demos, he is stepping aside to become its editor-atlarge too.
Back in November The Londoner reported that there was a plot to remove Goodhart altogether, with chair of trustees Phil Collins, former adviser to Tony Blair, said to be deeply unhappy with his director's politics. It seems that months of futile wrangling have come to an end with all sides signed up to a truce.
Goodhart, banned from the Hay festival for his anti-immigration book The British Dream, will edit the Demos journal and chair a new advisory board — including Charlie Falconer, Trevor Phillips and Onora O'Neill — remaining in charge of intellectual positioning. Day-to-day management rests with new chief executive Claudia Wood.
As for Collins v Goodhart? "Think of it this way," says one senior wonk. "The Korean War never officially ended. They just agreed a border after fighting to a stalemate."
