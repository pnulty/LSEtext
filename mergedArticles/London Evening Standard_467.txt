WITH his recalibration of Labour's position on the EU today, Ed Miliband has not ruled out a referendum on EU membership — nor has he committed himself to one should Labour win the election. What he has done is promise that in the unlikely (as he sees it) event of Britain being asked to transfer further powers to the EU, he would hold an in-out referendum. It is a reasonably neat solution to the problem of being seen to refuse people a say on the issue, or of being bounced into promising a poll by the Tories.
Yet the strategy has its dangers. In making clear that he thinks it very unlikely that Britain will be asked to cede further powers to Brussels, he is ruling out a poll in the foreseeable future — despite potentially serious changes to the EU's workings as a result of the divide between the eurozone core and non-euro nations. His gamble is that most of the electorate shares his view that the Tories look out of touch with their fixation on Europe. It may turn out that on issues such as freedom of labour the EU plays into concerns about immigration that people do care about. Still, today's pledge puts some clear water between the main parties: that should serve a useful electoral purpose.
