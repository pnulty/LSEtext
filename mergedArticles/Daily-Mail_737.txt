FRANCE'S far-Right National Front has angered Jews and Muslims by announcing it will stop offering non-pork school dinners to children in towns where it controls the local council.
The extremist party's leader, Marine Le Pen, said yesterday that no alternative meat would be served on days when pork was on the school menu.
'We will accept no religious requirements in the school lunch menus,' she a radio station. 'There is no reason for religion to enter into the public sphere.'
Miss Le Pen's anti-immigration party made huge gains in last weekend's municipal elections, and now controls 11 councils around France.
A year ago, a school in the village of Arveyres, south-west France, stopped offering an alternative meat to pork, which is forbidden under Jewish and Muslim dietary rules. The action triggered protests among parents outside the school.
Commenting on Miss Le Pen's announcement, France's League Against Rascism said: 'This decision is outrageous and highly discriminatory. Children need protein in their diets and many will now be having to eat only vegetables one day a week, or face breaking the rules of their faith.'
