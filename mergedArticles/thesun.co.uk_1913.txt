Sir Mike Rake faces a fierce backlash after claiming education was a bigger concern for UK PLC than immigration.
In a Mansion House speech he said: “Across the country, small and medium sized firms are telling us that the skill base in the UK is not adequate.
“And that they couldn’t manage without the skilled labour made available from Europe."
The CBI president said business was as worried about the fallout from “populist" policies regarding immigration as they are about rules on energy, tax and land ownership.
And he urged politicians to stop offering “headline grabbing" policies designed to secure votes rather than encourage investment.
Sir Mike reiterated the CBI believed Scotland and the UK stood “stronger together" and would be far weaker apart.
