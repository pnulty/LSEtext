BORIS JOHNSON held talks with Australia's foreign minister today as she said her country would "stick with" its national flag.
Julie Bishop, who is visiting the UK, said there was "no great demand" to change the current flag, which includes the Union Jack.
It comes just a day after New Zealand announced a referendum on whether to ditch its own Union Jack and Southern Cross star constellation flag.
It is unusual for a visiting foreign minister to meet the Mayor of London but Mr Johnson has strong ties with Australia and was named an honorary citizen in January.
Mr Johnson was expected to use the meeting, in his office at City Hall, to argue for an easing of working visa restrictions between the two countries.
He has called for a reciprocal relationship that would make it easier for Australians and New Zealanders to enter the UK labour market, despite David Cameron's push to cut non-EU immigration.
The Mayor is understood to support Ms Bishop's plan to keep the Australian flag but as a believer in self-determination is also likely to back New Zealand's decision to give its people a vote.
