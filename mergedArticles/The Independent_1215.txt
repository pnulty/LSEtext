THE HIGHS
HOUNDS OF LIVE
Kate Bush is baaaack! She's announced her first tour since 1979. Get those whirlwind dance moves ready … and your fastest-finger-first to actually get a ticket.
CENTRE STAGE
Eight of 14 plays in the National Theatre's new season are by women, including Rona Munro. Seems Nicholas Hytner is determined to go out on a gender-equal bang.
CUTTING STUFF
The Knife are doing an 'anti-national cabaret', returning to the form's political roots with songs on immigration policy and human rights. The scamps!
THE LOWS
MARA: PANNED
Thousands have signed online petitions against white actress Rooney Mara playing Native American princess Tiger Lily in a new film of Peter Pan.
VIVA LA VOICE
Chris Martin of Coldplay is to guest as a mentor on the US version of talent-show The Voice. Check out the super-awks snaps of him with coach Shakira!
SHAKE IT UP
We love his crazy dance moves and maraca-action, but Bez running for Parliament? Lord preserve us. (Though we would be interested in his drugs policy…)
