Schools in Bolton are to be encouraged to fly the Union Jack and ask pupils to sing God Save the Queen during assembly.
A motion to that effect was approved by the council by 34 votes to four. Councillor Mudasir Dean, who was behind the move, said it would help newly arrived immigrants integrate into society and promote national pride.
"Some of us feel English, some of us Scottish, Irish, Welsh, some a bit Lancastrian and some even a sense of European," he told The Bolton News.
"But if there is one lone symbol, one flag, that ties us together I believe it is Great Britain and the flag would be the Union Jack."
