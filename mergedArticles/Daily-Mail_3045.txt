UKIP WAS facing embarrassment last night after it emerged Eastern European migrants are being employed to deliver its election campaign leaflets.
Andrew Spalis, from the firm Fast Leaflet, which distributes material for Ukip across the South East, confirmed that Latvians and other European migrants have been used to spread the party's anti-EU message.
Mr Spalis said his firm keeps a list of workers who are available for casual work, most of whom are migrants. 'Sometimes I take English people, but not very often,' he added.
The revelation is embarrassing for Nigel Farage, who is riding high in the polls on the back of a tough pledge to clamp down on immigration from Europe.
The party has also courted controversy with a series of billboard posters warning that British workers are being 'hit hard by unlimited foreign labour'.
Ukip last night declined to comment, saying that leaflet distribution was 'a matter for individual branches'.
But Tory MP Gavin Barwell said the party was guilty of rank hypocrisy. He said: 'Ukip's hypocrisy knows no bounds.
'They say they are against Europeans taking our jobs and then, when they have a chance to offer some British people work delivering their leaflets because they can't find volunteers to do it, they employ European workers. You couldn't make it up.'
David Cameron also criticised Ukip yesterday, accusing the party of peddling the politics of 'fear' and talking down Britain's prospects in the world.
He said in the Commons: 'Britain has benefited from being an economy that is open to investment and open to people coming who want to contribute and work hard here.'
