DAVID Cameron told us that everything would be different on his watch.
After years of open borders under Labour, the PM vowed to get immigration down to the "tens of thousands".
But as statistic after statistic shows, that was a hollow promise.
Figures released yesterday reveal net migration is actually rising, with half a million people piling over our borders last year.
But as the shocking stats emerged, politicians of all parties were falling over themselves to welcome German leader Angela Merkel, who told us that EU free movement is here to stay. How can our MPs be so two-faced? Polls repeatedly show the public ranks immigration as the most important political issue.
No party will get our trust until they come clean and start tackling the problem honestly.
