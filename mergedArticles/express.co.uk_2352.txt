ONLY one in three illegal immigrants arrested after public tip-offs is kicked out of the UK, official figures show.
Home Office statistics reveal that of the 4,535 arrests for immigration offences last year following calls from the public, nearly 3,000 suspects are still here.
And the police launched criminal proceedings in just 15 cases. In 94 per cent of cases officials did not even properly follow up tip-offs, the Home Affairs Committee has revealed.
Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: “These figures show the Government just can’t get a grip on illegal immigration. It is shocking. For people to have confidence in our borders and immigration system, it’s crucial those who are here illegally are found and deported.”
Gerard Batten, of Ukip, said: “This is yet more proof that the system is not working.”
A Home Office spokesperson said: “The immigration system we ­inherited was shambolic and open to abuse.
“We take reports of illegal immigrants seriously but not all the information we receive is accurate.
“When tip-offs do lead to arrests, there are many legal barriers that can prevent speedy deportation. We are addressing that.”
