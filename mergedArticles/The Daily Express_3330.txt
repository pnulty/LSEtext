Kelly's Eye BY FERGUS KELLY
EVER since I was a kid growing up in West Yorkshire I've said "ta" - the diminutive of thank you - in everyday conversation. My mum, despite being born and bred there herself, disapproved of such vulgar usage, just as she always tried to persuade me to say "bar-th" for "bath". She thought it would improve my future prospects. I regret to report she failed in her endeavours.
Last week my 16-year-old son revealed - during one of those rare conversations we have now that doesn't include the phrases "what time are you coming home?" and "so when exactly are you planning to revise?" - that his friends have expressed bafflement whenever he says "ta". Apparently it is an entirely alien phrase to young southern ears.
I've been self-conscious about using it ever since. And what on earth must new immigrants to this country who pride themselves on at least knowing the terms "please" and "thank you" make of it?
