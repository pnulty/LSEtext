A POPULAR Wolverhampton pub could have its licence suspended after police complained about thefts, violence, unlawful gambling machines and the employment of illegal migrants.
Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, Chris Sims, has asked Wolverhampton Council to reconsider the licence of the Kings Arms after a string of incidents.
Councillors meeting on Wednesday will be told of a spate of problems at the pub in Dudley Road, Blakenhall, before deciding on its future.
Mr Sims said licensee Balraj Singh Thumber took over the pub on September 10, 2013.
He said officers had been called to the pub last September over a fight and also noted that drinks were being served outside licensing hours.
The following month police attended again after two men working in the kitchen were detained by immigration officers.
Another visit confirmed that the electricity meter had been tampered with.
