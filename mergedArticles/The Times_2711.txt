Fewer students from overseas
The number of overseas students starting courses in England has fallen for the first time in almost 30 years, research shows today.
The most significant decrease was among students from India and Pakistan, who have instead chosen to enrol at universities in the US and Australia.
The drop will raise fears that tougher immigration laws are driving away bona fide students, jeopardising the country's multibillion-pound higher education sector.
The trebling of annual tuition fees to £9,000 is also scaring off European students, the study suggests. The number of EU undergraduate entrants fell by a quarter in 2012-13, the first year of the new fees regime.
Analysis by the Higher Education Funding Council for England shows the first decline in the number of overseas students starting degrees in England for 29 years.
In 2011, 311,800 international students started full-time courses at English universities but by 2012 it had fallen to 307,205.
The number of international students embarking on a full-time postgraduate degree fell by 1 per cent between 2010 and 2012, compared with double-digit growth in previous years.
The intake of students from India and Pakistan halved during the same two-year period, while their number grew in other countries.
The report said: "The number of full-time EU undergraduate entrants, who have to pay the same fees as UK students, fell by almost a quarter in 2012, probably as a result of the recent increase in tuition fees."
It warned that universities were leaving themselves open to risk, as global markets change.
About three quarters of those starting full-time taught masters degrees are from outside the UK, and there are almost equal proportions of British and Chinese students on such courses.
The report added: "This aspect of postgraduate provision is increasingly exposed to changes in international demand. These proportions are influenced by declines in entrants from traditional postgraduate markets, such as India, Pakistan and Iran, coupled with continued growth from China."
Overall, there were 7,000 first yearstudents from India, a fall of 51 per cent on the previous year, and 1,400 from Pakistan, 49 per cent lower than in 2011, although this was partly offset by China, with 8,300 more students and a 44 per cent year-on-year growth.
At the same time, the US reported a 10 per cent growth in international postgraduate students, with a 40 per cent increase in those from India. Australia also saw a significant increase in students from India and Pakistan, after streamlining its visa processing service.
The Home Office has clamped down on student visas as part of its target to reduce net migration, and introduced much tougher checks and controls. This has been interpreted in some parts of the Indian sub-continent as meaning its students are no longer welcome.
The contribution of British universities to the economy has grown by a quarter in two years. A study by Universities UK found that the sector generated £73 billion in output in 2011-12, up 24 per cent since 2009.
