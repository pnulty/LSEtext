UKIP boss Nigel Farage dropped a double election launch gaffe - over a fake voter and his foreign wife.
Overshadowing the anti-EU party's euro campaign start, its leader was stumped by a BBC grilling on why employing his German missus Kirsten was not depriving a British worker of a job - a key Ukip anti-immigration message.
Mr Farage could only insist: "Nobody else could do that job.
"I don't know anybody who would work those kinds of hours."
In a second embarrassment, it emerged that a young female 'voter' from Devon pictured in Ukip's new manifesto was actually a senior party official.
Half Indian Lizzy Vaid was quoted as saying she had turned to Ukip because "they're the only party listening".
But it swiftly emerged she works in Ukip HQ as Mr Farage's Events Manager.
