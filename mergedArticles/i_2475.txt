The Boris bikes-to-DLR operator Serco yesterday revealed just how battered it was by the electronic prisoner tagging scandal last year.
Pre-tax profit slumped by 62 per cent to £107m and the group, which poached Aggreko's Rupert Soames as its new chief executive last week, said this year would be just as tough.
Acting chief executive Ed Casey said the group was internally forecasting a mid-single-digit fall in revenues this year as it loses a large chunk of immigration work in Australia.
It also warned that profit margins would be 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent lower than last year.
That all adds up to an operating profit of between £220m and £250m for 2014, down from £285m last year. Revenues will fall from £5.1bn in 2013 to between £4.7bn and £4.9bn.
