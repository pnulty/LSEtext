Home Office staff yesterday searched a language school at the centre of a government investigation over claims migrants could buy qualifications supporting their asylum bids.
Immigration teams raided the Learn Pass Succeed (LPS) school in Upton Park, east London, after secret filming showed language certificates being sold for £500. Uzwan Ghani, a director at LPS, said the problem was confined to the Upton Park branch and that tests there had been suspended.
