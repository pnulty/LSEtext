SUN POLL EXCLUSIVE
He wins TV debate
NIGEL Farage thrashed Nick Clegg as the pair went head to head in a live TV debate last night on quitting the EU.
Ukip's boss got the thumbs-up from 57 per cent watching or listening on radio, an exclusive Sun poll revealed.
Deputy PM Mr Clegg — leader of the Lib Dems — was rated the victor by just 36 per cent. Seven per cent judged it too close to call — after a fiery clash on Sky News that saw both come close to losing their notoriously short tempers. It was hosted by London radio station LBC in front of an audience of listeners — after Mr Clegg threw down a challenge on Nick Ferrari's show.
Mr Farage had a pint beforehand — describing it as "a quick whistle-wetter".
He then went in saying it was a moment he had been "waiting 20 years" for.
He won a coin toss and allowed Mr Clegg to speak first. The Lib Dem, 47, said leaving the EU would throw Brits on the dole — declaring: "I'm not prepared to see anyone lose their job on the altar of Nigel Farage's anti-European dogma".
The Ukip chief, 49, kept returning to his favourite theme — immigration.
His opponent at one stage brandished a Ukip flier that claimed as many as 29million Romanian and Bulgarians may head here. Mr Clegg scoffed: "There aren't even 29 million people living in Romania and Bulgaria." But Mr Farage said of Brussels forcing the UK to open the floodgates: "Are we to be a self governing nation or not?
"I believe the people are on our side." The Sun's poll afterwards backed him.
Lib Dem Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander last night put on a brave face, insisting he thought his boss "won hands down".
He said: "If 36 per cent of people are backing Nick Clegg, that means there are a lot of votes out there for us on Europe."
A source close to Mr Clegg said: "Nigel Farage didn't have anywhere near as good a grasp of the facts."
