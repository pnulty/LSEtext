A POLISH MP is living in London on £100 a week to see why so many Poles prefer Britain.
Artur Debski has followed nearly a million of his countrymen by taking a low-cost flight to the UK.
He had an offer of digs from a girl on Facebook and is seeking a job while surviving on his low ­income and speaking little English.
Mr Debski wants to know why so many Poles are quitting one of Europe’s most successful economies.
Before leaving home, he said: “I want to see why people in Britain are happy and we Poles are not.
“I want to see why the systems in Britain are working and why they’re not in Poland.

“I don’t know what I’m going to do there, I’m 45 years old and my English isn’t great.
"I’ll have to work with my hands, in a kitchen, perhaps, or a shop.”
Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, more than a million nationals are thought to have emigrated to Britain.
A poll by market researchers Ipsos showed 72% of Poles ­already in the UK intend to stay, have children and take out mortgages.
And figures suggest 70% of young people in Poland are eyeing a move.
Mr Debski added: “It’s dangerous for Poland that so many of our young people are thinking about leaving.”
