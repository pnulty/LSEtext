Yes THE doom and gloom merchants underestimate the economic picture when it comes to the way people vote in elections ("Tories ready to fight election on two fronts", April 26).
I am confident that by the time voters get to the polling stations next year our economy will be roaring ahead on all fronts.
Add to that the thought of Labour's Ed Miliband and Ed Balls wrecking all the good work of the past few difficult years and the electorate will surely see that the only hope for a prosperous future is to vote for the Conservatives.
R Johnson, Birmingham No IF the Conservatives are going to fight the next election purely on the basis of the economy, it is understandable but folly.
Despite the improved economic news most people are still feeling the effects of austerity and not any upturn in their pockets.
Meanwhile, the news on the rest of the Government's term in office is, apart from the economic improvement, unremittingly bad.
The EU is still costing us billions with no referendum as promised, there is no real improvement in the benefits picture and we continue to see runaway immigration.
