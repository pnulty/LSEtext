IMMIGRATION is out of control. As things stand, it cannot be controlled.
Of all this Government's hasty promises four years ago, slashing net migration to tens of thousands a year now looks the most ridiculous.
They HAVE cut migrants from outside the EU. They are powerless to stop them coming from within it.
As our economy improves, far fewer Brits are moving abroad — while thousands flee their native Romania, Bulgaria, Italy, Spain and Portugal for greener pastures here.
Some will benefit the UK. But our schools, hospitals and housing cannot cope with an extra 212,000 people a year. And this was the figure BEFORE all controls on Romanians and Bulgarians were removed last month.
This is a crucial issue for voters.
The Sun has urged David Cameron to make it a red-line demand in his renegotiation with Europe. It is disheartening to learn he can expect little support from Angela Merkel.
And while Labour are right to say Government policy is in tatters, it was THEM who deliberately expanded our population by millions.
On immigration Labour have zero credibility. The Tories' is rapidly disappearing too.
