Immigrants are flocking to Germany in the biggest numbers in 20 years, including a large increase in arrivals from the crisis-hit countries of southern Europe, according to official data published on Thursday.
But with the economy growing, labour shortages mounting and unemployment falling, the influx has generated little public protest. That is distinct from other EU member states, such as France and the UK, where immigration is featuring as a central issue in this week's European parliament elections.
"There is no acrimonious debate in Germany, just occasional flash points. That astonishes me," said Helmut Anheier, dean of Berlin's Hertie School of Governance.
According to the government statistics department, some 1.22m people arrived in the federal republic in 2013, while only 789,000 people moved abroad, leaving a net increase of 437,000.
Both the gross and the net inflows were the largest since 1993, when Germany was flooded with people fleeing post-cold war turmoil in eastern Europe and war in the former Yugoslavia.
The main driver of the current wave is the lure of jobs in the EU's most dynamic economy, where unemployment stands at just 6.7 per cent, the lowest in two decades.
Germany in 2012 recorded the second-largest inflow of immigrants in the world after the US, according to separate data published this week by the OECD, the rich countries' grouping. Germany has soared from eighth place in 2009, overtaking traditional immigration magnets, including the UK, Australia, Canada and Spain.
The German government report said that overall immigration rose 13 per cent last year. The biggest contingent - some 727,000 - came from the EU. That was fuelled by large increases from southern Europe, with a 52 per cent rise in arrivals from Italy to 61,000, and 19 per cent from Spain to 44,000.
The biggest single group of immigrants remain the Poles, with 189,000, or 16.1 per cent of the total, followed by Romanians, with 135,000, or 11 per cent.
Germans mostly accept that their ageing society needs immigrants to work in its factories, offices and care homes but are concerned about possible abuses of their generous welfare system.
These worries were eased this week with an opinion from the advocate general of the European Court of Justice saying that countries can reject benefit claims by citizens of other EU countries if the applicants are not seriously looking for work.
The case stems from claims filed by a Romanian woman who gave birth to a child during her stay in Leipzig in eastern Germany. She received child benefits, which are easily accessed in Germany, but was refused unemployment support when the authorities decided that she was not actively seeking a job.
As well as waiting for a final judgment, the German government is preparing laws to clamp down on welfare abuse with tougher penalties for offenders. The plans are due to be published in June.
