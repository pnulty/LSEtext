Iain Macwhirter credits the SNP with campaigning for open borders and pro-immigration (Why are Yes so confident?, Comment, March 30). Looking past the bluff and ­bluster that both the British and EU free travel areas would never break down, if these did break down citizenship would affect who can live here. The White Paper citizenship policy shockingly threatens  to divide families by closing our country to some Scottish offspring.
This is because it does not make citizenship by descent an automatic entitlement. Our new state would cling on to the discretion to say no to applications from those who were born in exile.
