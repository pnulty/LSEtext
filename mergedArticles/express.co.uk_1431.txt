FOREIGN Secretary William Hague is right to say Ukraine is the biggest crisis facing Europe in the 21st century.
You would have to go as far back as the Cuban missile stand-off in 1962 to find a greater threat to peace. There are worrying echoes of 1914 when a far less significant event in a remote corner of the Balkans escalated into a world war that killed at least 20 million people.
I fear President Vladimir Putin will be unable to retreat from military intervention even if he wants to because that would mark Russia as a second-class power incapable of defending what it considers to be its own territory.
So we are back to the Cold War with the US and Britain leading calls to punish Russia by kicking it out of the G8 and imposing sanctions. Putin will then have to react, probably by cutting off gas supplies to Europe.
It’s a ghastly mess and I don’t see how it can be resolved unless one side backs down. Ukraine, half European and half Russian, can’t be ignored as Syria was. We must all pray that the world does not yet again stumble into catastrophe.

A BUTCHER who removed dead animals from his window after complaints that the “disgusting" display upset children has reinstated the carcasses following overwhelming support.
John Sawyer, 53, who runs the shop in Sudbury, Suffolk, was unnecessarily apologetic in removing his rabbits, poultry and pigs’ heads after merely a couple of whingeing letters in the local newspaper.
The people of Sudbury should count themselves lucky to have a family butcher’s at a time when so many food shops have been forced out of business by customers migrating to supermarkets.
I don’t think many children are upset by the sight of meat, which is prominently on display at supermarkets, too, along with fish. It’s immoral to feed flesh to children and to hide the reality of the food’s origin. Anyone who can’t live with it can become a vegetarian and cross the street.

I DESPISE the widespread hypocrisy about the origins and consequences of cheap clothing. I listened to a debate on the radio last week in which listeners lambasted the appalling conditions in Third World sweat shops.
Almost everyone would agree if questioned that child labour, starvation wages, dangerous machinery and 18-hour days are inhuman. Minutes later they will be filling shopping bags with the products of those same factories.
It’s pointless to say we should buy British because so little clothing is made here and costs make things too expensive for all but the rich.
The dismal fact is that people have been exploited since the beginning of human kind. There are plenty of workers being exploited right now here in sanctimonious Britain.
If you really feel strongly about all this you ought to be self-sufficient. Sell your nice house, buy a smallholding, eat tofu and porridge, learn to sew and ride a bike .

AFTER having a go at big companies who expect us to wait at home all day for deliveries I am delighted to say that I’ve had a result. My mobile had been playing up so I asked the phone company for a new one. It would be delivered tomorrow I was told.
“Oh no, not another case of some time between 8am and 6pm," I thought.
Indeed not as I later received both a text and an email saying the phone would arrive between 14.37 and 15.37 and if that didn’t suit there were alternatives. A courier duly rang the bell just before 3pm and handed me the package. That’s what I call proper service so my hat goes off to 3 mobile.
Why can’t all deliveries be done that way? No reason at all. Just as there is no reason why airlines can’t allocate you a seat, as easyJet has now conceded.
With very little more thought and effort big business could make life so much better for everyone.

THE Tories insist they hope to reduce immigration to 10,000 a year in the face of compelling evidence saying, “no way".
The key word is “hope". This is politician-speak meaning, “There’s absolutely no chance that we will keep the promise we made but we want you to believe we meant it most sincerely, folks."
It’s just possible if Britain slashed benefits that fewer people from the poorer parts of the EU would come here but no Government would cut them enough, not even the hardest-nosed Tories even if the Lib Dems would let them.
Seeing as how Vince Cable thinks 200,000 plus immigrants a year are a jolly good thing we can rule that out.

I KNOW now for a fact that Prime Minister David Cameron is scared of Nick Clegg.
When Chancellor Angela Merkel was speaking in German to MPs multilingual Clegg didn’t need to wear translation headphones. Cameron didn’t seem to have any either – unless they were invisible – although he doesn’t speak German. A bit pathetic, Dave.

ANY cat experts out there? My wife’s sister has a moggy called Jackson that hasn’t got the right idea about mice.
Jackson brings them into the house as presents for her and leaves them to run around. She catches them and, thoughtful person that she is, puts them back outside. Jackson then…well, you can guess.
Please don’t say drown the cat as she’s very fond of him.
