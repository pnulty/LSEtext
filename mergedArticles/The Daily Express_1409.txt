THE Government is still aiming to cut annual net immigration to "tens of thousands" despite the latest surge in newcomers, a Tory Cabinet Minister insisted yesterday.
Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps expressed "hope" the target will be reached by next year's General Election.
Official figures last week showed a 50,000 rise in the net influx to 200,000 migrants in the year to September, sparking calls for the Government to accept the policy had flopped and scrap the target.
Even Home Secretary Theresa May appeared to acknowledge the "tens of thousands" target can't be reached as long as Britain is signed up to EU freedomof-movement rules.
But Mr Shapps said: "That's still our goal, to bring the numbers down. Asked on the BBC1 Andrew Marr Show if it was still possible, Mr Shapps said: "I very much hope so."
He said ministers had succeeded in cutting numbers coming to Britain from outside the EU.
And he said new measures introduced this year by the Home Office are yet to have an impact on figures. Mr Shapps spoke out after ex-Tory Defence Secretary Liam Fox described the immigration target as "statistical nonsense".
He urged the Tories to come up with a clearer message to stop former voters switching to Ukip.
The Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday admitted EU rules were hampering her task.
"As long as there is such an enormous disparity in terms of income per head there will be an overwhelming incentive for people to move from poorer nations to richer states," Mrs May said.
