French President Raymond Poincare unprecedentedly gives sworn evidence in the Caillaux Affair

From time to time articles appear in the press giving examples of the perceived lack of knowledge of the young (ignorance of historical awareness being particularly popular) or their inability to spell after a survey or the like, but it seems that this might be nothing new, given the report on page 15 of schoolboy “howlers” issued by the Chief Examiner after London examinations.
In a way it is quite impressive that those taking the test can manage no fewer than 87 different spellings for reservoir, and one wonders quite what was meant about water being put into large tanks and filleted. Some of what are considered howlers are quite revealing about life at the time in the poorer areas – “When people have no money to have a drink they go to the tap, and have a drop of water,” or “the girl must learn to saw because nearly the whole time from 14 years of age until she gets married she must sew.”
Some of the uses of ships given are quite entertaining – “if there were no ships people could not go and see models of them” has some sort of logic to it; “to go to foreign countries and teach savages how to dress” is symptomatic of how many people saw the world at the time; whilst it's likely that the answer “to take Mrs Pankhurst to a lonely island” would be seen as a very good use of a ship by a number of readers of the newspaper!
