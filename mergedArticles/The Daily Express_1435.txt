THE Tories insist they hope to reduce immigration to 10,000 a year in the face of compelling evidence saying, "no way".
The key word is "hope". This is politician–speak meaning, "There's absolutely no chance that we will keep the promise we made but we want you to believe we meant it most sincerely, folks."
It's just possible if Britain slashed benefits that fewer people from the poorer parts of the EU would come here but no Government would cut them enough, not even the hardest–nosed Tories even if the Lib Dems would let them.
Seeing as how Vince Cable thinks 200,000 plus immigrants a year are a jolly good thing we can rule that out.
