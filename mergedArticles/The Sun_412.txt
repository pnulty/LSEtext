THERESA May insisted the poorest Brits are the biggest victims of rising immigration last night.
The Home Secretary blasted critics of the Government's strategy and backed immigration minister James Brokenshire. He was slammed last week for saying only the "wealthy metropolitan elite" benefit from migrants driving down the cost of some services.
Ms May told the House of Commons: "Uncontrolled gross immigration of course does put pressure on public services. "The people who suffer from the impact of this are those at the lower end of the income scale."
