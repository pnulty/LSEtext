? Good to see we're taking a hard line on immigration these days and rooting out the foreign scum who move here and threaten mayhem against us. So Yashika Bageerathi, 19, is dispatched back to Mauritius after warning us that she intended to take her A-levels in a month or two and expected to get very good results. Ha! No you won't, not now.
Bageerathi, who came here legally with her family and has never committed a crime, has been held in a detention centre since last month. A petition of 175,000 names failed to sway the home secretary Theresa May.
And this is the problem — studious, law-abiding and pro-British individuals such as Yashika are the only people we can kick out of the country. Rapists, murderers and deranged jihadists we have to keep, in case they receive inclement treatment in their hellish lands of origin. There is no moral, social or economic sense to this absurd policy.
