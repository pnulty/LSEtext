Officials have drastically underestimated net migration into the UK because they missed tens of thousands of people arriving at regional airports every year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
The combined effect of people leaving and coming to the UK was that the population grew by 2.53 million between 2001 and 2011, the ONS said yesterday, rather than 2.18 million as originally estimated.
The revelation that the figures were out by 346,000 - about the population of Cardiff - came after statisticians discovered that there had been "inadequate sampling" of passengers at small airports.
They had focused too heavily on the main hubs, such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester, using a system developed in the 1960s.
Citizens arriving from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia were missed by the International Passenger Survey between 2004 and 2008, the review found, as new flight routes into the UK were added.
Arrivals are not physically counted; instead the figures are based on surveys. One expert said the mistake showed the limitations of this method, adding that "better migration data" was needed.
Over the 11-year period, net migration ranged from 172,000 in 2002 to 273,000 in 2007.
The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "What the latest ONS statistics underline is the point at which, in the 2000s, immigration was out of control."
But he added that, despite the error, David Cameron had "confidence" in the ONS. Mr Cameron has set a target of reducing net migration to below 100,000 by 2015.
