AIRLINE passengers faced disruption last night after an IT fault resulted in extended queues at immigration desks.
Lengthy queues started forming at airports across the country after a glitch on UK Border Force computers yesterday afternoon.
Extra staff were drafted in to try to reduce the queues and a government spokesman apologised "for any additional time to passengers' journeys". Non–EU passengers were particularly badly hit and a Heathrow spokesman said that there had been "some longer queues than normal in the terminals".
A Birmingham Airport spokesman said that he was "aware [of the glitch] and the impact it was having", adding that it appeared "to be getting progressively worse".
A Gatwick spokesman said that the airport was "working to get people through".
Chris Hyland, a 32–year–old company director from Islington in north London, said international passengers at Gatwick had been told to expect a wait of up to four hours.
He said: "We landed from Geneva at 5.20pm but it took until 6.40pm for us to get through passport control."
But a Glasgow Airport spokesman said it had been "largely unaffected" by the fault.
