Tough, outspoken and sharp
SO there's a Tory debate on how to cut taxes? Good.
What a turnaround for an economy down the drain under Brown and Balls.
Osborne wants to keep raising the personal allowance threshold - taking the lower-paid out of tax - while some Blues are arguing for a cut in the top rates.
Treasury insiders tell me George is standing firm.
They point out that, to win in 2015, Tories desperately need to be on the side of working-class strivers - who are fed up with Ed Miliband's love of the EU and immigration. Furthermore, the personal allowance rise actually benefits the middle classes - anyone earning up to £100K gains. Add up National Insurance and threshold rises, and by April, when the personal allowance hits £10,000, a higher-rate payer will save £500+ a year.
So why the whining? Tory MPs need to remember that George Osborne ALWAYS wears two hats - Iron Chancellor and election guru.
Winning seats like my old town of Corby means the Tories must prioritise putting money in the pockets of factory workers, bus drivers, school dinner ladies and traffic wardens - hard workers who control all those marginal seats. He's been proved right on the economy again and again - and George is in no mood to argue.
DAVID CAMERON, right. was in Israel this week working towards the peace process as the country was attacked by rockets from Gaza. The PM's made at least ten major foreign visits in the past six months, while Ed Miliband messed up so badly on Syria, he seems afraid of stepping outside SW1. When Cam was opposition leader, he travelled widely for policy, including trips to Georgia, South Africa and Washington.
Can you think of a SINGLE foreign policy of Ed's?
