Downing Street was forced yesterday to check how a foreign-born nanny employed by David and Samantha Cameron became a British citizen.
The issue blew up after James Brokenshire, the newly appointed Immigration minister, delivered a speech which appeared to blame the "wealthy metropolitan elite" who employ foreign-born staff for jeopardising the employment prospects of working-class Britons.
The Camerons have never made a secret of the fact that they employed a Nepalese-born nanny, Gita Lima, who has worked with them for years and moved with them into Downing Street.
Labour whip Phil Wilson demanded: "There must now be complete transparency and openness from the Prime Minister over any contact between him, his office and the Home Office regarding his family's nanny."
After some delay, No 10 confirmed that Samantha Cameron was named as the nanny's employer on her application form, as required, but said that neither of the Camerons had written a letter to support her application.
