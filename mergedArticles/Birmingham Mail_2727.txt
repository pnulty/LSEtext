A FORMER Mayor of Wolverhampton has stunned colleagues by defecting from the Lib Dems to UKIP.
Coun Maclolm Gwinnett was until recently leader of the three strong Lib Dem group on Wolverhampton City Council.
Defections to UKIP, which is growing in popularity as the European elections approach, have become quite common in recent months but it is almost unheard of for a politician to leave the pro-European Union Lib Dems to join the eurosceptic party.
Coun Gwinnet, who was Mayor of Wolverhampton in 2010-11, fell out with Lib Dem colleagues over his selection for the Springvale ward after they picked another candidate while he was unwell with a heart condition in hospital.
He said: "I felt as though I had been stabbed in the back by my so-called council colleagues. On the issue of immigration I think the Liberal Democrats have lost the plot as well as on matters such like pushing through HS2 without consideration for anybody."
He is also critical of the Lib Dem's role in the coalition Government over issues such as the bedroom tax.
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage, said: "Malcolm is not only a former Mayor but has proven himself to have great fighting spirit too, having undergone an urgent heart transplant battling his way back to fitness."
