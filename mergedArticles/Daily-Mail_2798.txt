* 532,000 people arrived in Britain in year to September, up from 497,000
* 320,000 left the UK, down from 343,000 a year earlier, ONS says
* Number of Romanians and Bulgarians arriving almost trebles to 24,000
* Tories promised to cut net migration to less than 100,000 by 2015
David Cameron's pledge to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands' suffered a devastating blow today as figures showed the figure rose by a third in a single year.
The Conservatives vowed to reduce the gap between numbers arriving and leaving to fewer than 100,000 before the general election.
But in the year to September net migration hit 212,000, up by almost a third from 154,000 in the same period in 2012 - a surge fuelled by arrivals from elsewhere in the European Union.
The Office for National Statistics said the sharp rise was 'statistically significant', including the number of Romanians and Bulgarians arriving in Britain almost trebling in a single year.
The government has been preparing for a sharp rise in the numbers from the two countries when work restrictions were lifted in January this year.
But today's figures show the influx was already underway last year, with 24,000 arriving from Romania and Bulgaria in the 12 months to September compared to just 9,000 in the year before.
In total 532,000 immigrants came to Britain in the latest period, up from 343,000 a year earlier.
At the same time 320,000 people left the UK, down slightly from 343,000 year-on-year.
It meant net migration - the difference between the number arriving and the number leaving - was 212,000 the highest since 2011 and higher than the last two full years of the Labour government.
Tory ministers were forced to admit the target was all but impossible to meet because no formal immigration controls can be imposed on migrants from elsewhere in the EU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel used a rare speech to Parliament in Westminster to hail free movement as 'one of the greatest achievements of European unification'.
The ONS said: 'There was a statistically significant increase in immigration of EU2 (Romanian and Bulgarian) citizens to 24,000 in the year ending September 2013 from 9,000 in the previous year. An
estimated 70 per cent arrived for work and 30 per cent for study.'
Immigration minister James Brokenshire admitted the government is powerless to control the numbers of people coming from elsewhere in the EU, despite the pledge to cut the total figure.
'Numbers are down across the board in areas where we can control immigration, but arrivals from the EU have doubled in the last year,' he said.
'The Government is ensuring that our controls on accessing benefits and services, including the NHS and social housing, are among the tightest in Europe.
'We cannot impose formal immigration controls on EU migrants, so we are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and seeking to address the factors that drive European immigration to Britain.'
Mr Brokenshire went on: 'Uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on our public services and forces down wages for people on low incomes.'
But Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'It is utterly pointless setting immigration figures when you can't control who comes in to this country. They were for spin only.'
Overall net migration of all EU citizens doubled from 65,000 in the year ending September 2012 to 131,000 in the year ending September 2013.
In December Mr Cameron hinted that it was becoming increasingly difficult to meet his pledge to reduce net migration below 100,000. At that the latest figure was 182,000, well below today's figure of 212,000.
Speaking on a trip to China, the Prime Minister said: 'A lot of these things take an amount of time to be dealt with.’
Three years ago Mr Cameron used a major speech to insist he would leave no stone unturned in his bid to reduce immigration to levels last seen in the 1980s.
He said: 'Our borders will be under control and immigration will be at levels our country can manage. No ifs. No buts. That's a promise we made to the British people. And it's a promise we are keeping.'
But those words were seized on by Labour today. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'These figures show the Government's net migration target is in tatters, and their immigration policy is a mess.
'David Cameron promised, "no ifs, no buts" to cut net migration to the tens of thousands, yet these figures show net migration has gone up and is now more than twice that figure.'
