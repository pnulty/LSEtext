AN ILLEGAL immigrant is demanding to stay in Britain to look after the five children he has fathered since he arrived.
Mohammed Zulfiqar, who was smuggled in on a fake passport, is battling deportation to Pakistan claiming he has a human right to a family life.
He paid £15,000 for forged travel documents so he could enter the country illegally in 2002.
Since then he has met and married a British woman and now has five children under six.
Zulfiqar, 55, was arrested last year after he used his bogus passport to support a job application to be a doorman.
Inquiries revealed the man named in the passport had reported it stolen.
And the National Insurance number quoted by Zulfiqar belonged to a dead man.
He was jailed for 21 months at Leeds Crown Court after being convicted of possessing a fake passport and using it to gain employment.
His lawyer Lisa Julian said Zulfiqar, from Bradford, wanted to stay to look after his children. She also said his wife has health difficulties.
But Mr Recorder Keith Miller told him: “I believe you know very much more than you are prepared to divulge about the circumstances in which you acquired the British passport and the stamps on the Pakistani passport.”
The judge told Zulfiqar it would be up to the Home Office what happened over his deportation, but his family could join him in Pakistan.
