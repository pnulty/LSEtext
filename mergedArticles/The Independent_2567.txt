Ron DeKoven
Founder, Mybarrister.co.uk
"Since 2004, barristers have been able to take instructions directly from clients, rather than only through solicitors, as had been the case. The idea appealed to many barristers but they worried about the cost of marketing their services and were concerned solicitors would blacklist them if they started going direct. I realised there was an opportunity for a business here to take those problems out of the equation - if we could solve the marketing headache for barristers, and attract enough barristers so solicitors wouldn't have the option of blacklisting them.
"It took almost two years of thinking and planning to get up and running. We started with a soft launch, and learned a great deal from our early months of trading, so that we were able to really go for it later that year.
"Barristers pay us a £1,200 annual membership fee and agree to give their first half-hour of time to clients at no charge. The clients pay nothing to us, but can use our site to find a barrister specialising in the particular area where they need help. We get a broad range of inquiries - and we can help people on the phone as well as online - but the leading issues are family, employment and immigration.
"It's going really well - we've already signed up more than 100 barristers and we're getting 200 to 300 visits a day from potential clients."
