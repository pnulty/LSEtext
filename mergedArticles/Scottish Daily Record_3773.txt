NIGEL Farage isn't just frightening the political horses, he's beginning to alarm me and the SNP, too.
With UK polls showing UKIP now leading the way in the Euro-elections, the SNP fear the Kippers are within a cat's whisker of gaining a Scottish MEP at their expense.
The SNP are keen for UKIP to have a strong showing in England, but not in Scotland.
It is essential for their "two nations" narrative that the headline results are different, although Scottish attitudes to immigration are as hostile as English ones. Also, the SNP don't want Farage stealing their anti-mainstream thunder.
An ICM poll last week found the SNP comfortably ahead in European voting elections on 37 per cent, down four points.
That could translate as three out of Scotland's six MEPs. Yay for the SNP.
Labour, at 28 per cent, can expect to return two MEPs.
The Conservatives on 11 per cent can scrape one MEP on Thursday, May 22.
The Lib Dems, on a measly seven per cent of the poll, are off the board.
Under the proportional voting system, the SNP could expect to benefit if the Lib Dems lose one. But UKIP had gained four points, taking them to 10 per cent support in Scotland. Uh, oh.
An increase of just a few percentage points could put Farage in position to have his first MEP in Scotland.
UKIP claim they are "within striking distance" of taking a seat the SNP had taken for granted. Gulp.
Winning at the cost of the SNP would be sweet revenge for the UKIP leader who was drummed out of Scotland by a nationalist mob last year.
