THE United Nations is launching an investigation into violence against women in Britain.
A UN 'special rapporteur' will spend two weeks looking at 'manifestations of violence perpetrated in the family and in the community' - and our Government's response.
The visit by South African academic Rashida Manjoo has angered ministers, who fear it will lead to UN demands for radical new laws. One Government source said the inquiry would produce 'a fiesta of politically correct nonsense about a serious issue'.
Last autumn the UN's special rapporteur on adequate housing, Raquel Rolnik, delivered a report demanding an end to the so-called bedroom tax, infuriating many Tories.
Professor Manjoo, who arrived in Britain on Monday, will visit women's shelters and consider immigrant groups. She said violence to women 'continues to be one of the most pervasive human rights violations globally'.
