CULTURE Secretary Sajid Javid last night insisted migrants had to learn English and respect British culture.
The Tory minister, whose parents came here from Pakistan, said he also understood voters' fears over excessive migration.
He said: "People say that when immigrants come to Britain they should work, make a contribution and respect our way of life. "I agree with that. It means things like trying to learn English." Mr Javid, also Equalities minister, added: "People want Britain to have more control over its borders and I think they're right."
But he said only Tories could push the EU into reforms.
