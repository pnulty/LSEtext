Leading UK business figures have warned David Cameron, the prime minister, against a further strengthening of immigration controls as the government struggles to meet its target for cutting net migration.
More than half of FTSE 100 chairmen who participated in a survey by headhunters Korn Ferry said tougher immigration laws would harm competitiveness and growth. Only one in 10 believed they would help the economy.
While 52 per cent were concerned about the impact on Britain of a crackdown, they did not think their companies would be harmed to the same extent. Just 34 per cent said tightened immigration would damage the competitiveness and growth of their business, while 56 per cent believed it would have no effect.
Net migration to the UK rose by more than a third to 212,000 in the year to September, dealing a blow to the prime minister's hopes of reaching his "tens of thousands" target by May 2015.
Theresa May, the home secretary, is considering shortening visas for foreign employees by as little as one day, which would avoid labelling them as migrants, a statistical sleight of hand that would cut net migration by more than 19,000.
One chairman said of potential tighter controls: "Bolting the stable door now makes little sense: the UK will lose out on attracting world talent."
Korn Ferry questioned 29 chairmen representing 32 FTSE 100 companies in February as part of its regular Boardroom Pulse survey.
