Chava is a golem, a creature made of clay, brought to life by a disgraced rabbi. When her master dies en route from Poland to New York, she finds herself cast adrift in an alien city. Ahmad is a djinni, born in Syria, but accidently released by a Manhattan tinsmith. In this bold debut, Helene Wecker explores 19th-century immigrant life in the Lower East Side and Little Syria through the eyes of this folkloric couple. An inventive storyteller, Wecker makes us care about the fate of these two outsiders more than you might expect. Shades of Isaac Bashevis Singer and Cynthia Ozick.
