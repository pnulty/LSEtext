Watch out Corona, Coors and Cobra - Britain is fast developing a taste for Polish lager, industry figures reveal.
Thanks to the influx of workers from Eastern Europe, Tyskie beer has become so popular in the UK it has made the top ten 'World Beers' table.
The list records the best-selling foreign beers and lagers in the UK, outside the mass-market brewers such as Carling and Stella.
But while the other brands have built up a strong following in Britain over decades, Tyskie - owned by SABMiller - is a relative newcomer thanks to the influx of Polish immigrants in recent years.
At 5.6 per cent it is stronger than most other lagers sold over here which are often too weak for Eastern European tastes.
