A REAL-LIFE Shirley Valentine is demanding a move back to Britain with her Tunisian toy boy - as they are broke. But Deborah Chniti's plan has been scuppered after husband Ala was denied a visa as the couple do not have enough money. Grandmother-of-four Mrs Chniti, 43, met her 27-yearold husband on Facebook and moved to Africa in 2012. She believed she could return with Ala within four years but new rules have killed off the couple's hopes. Mrs Chniti, who lived on benefits in Britain, has been told they must have £62,500 in savings if Ala is to be granted a visa. But he earns just £5 a day as a labourer. Mrs Chniti, originally of Stoke, said: It's disgusting. The government just wants my money and is letting all the wrong immigrants in.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'We welcome those who wish to make a life in Britain but it must not be at the taxpayers' expense.'
