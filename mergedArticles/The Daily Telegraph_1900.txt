VINCE Cable, the Business Secretary, has warned that the UK cannot "duck the issue of immigration" if the economy is to continue to grow.
In a speech in the City of London last night, Mr Cable said that businesses big and small cannot afford to wait for politicians to resolve what to do on immigration.
Pointing to some of the Square Mile's greatest forebears, he said that dynasties such as "the Rothschilds, Warburgs, Cazenoves" were immigrants, who had "fuelled our economic success historically".
"Bearing down on economic migration is a clear example of a restriction on trade," cautioned Mr Cable, in a speech at the Lord Mayor's trade and industry dinner at the Mansion House.
"Bear down on immigrants, and you lose some of the most dynamic, innovative and imaginative workers in your economy. The costs are huge," he went on.
Mr Cable pointed to business's continued questioning of why students from countries such as China and India who graduate from British universities cannot then gain visas to work in the UK.
