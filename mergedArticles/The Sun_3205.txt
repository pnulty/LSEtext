EVERY new arrival to Britain will be counted in and counted out for the first time, Labour will pledge today.
Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper will promise strict entry and exit checks if her party wins power.
The ambitious move will allow officials to track down and expel tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who overstay their visas. It is Labour's biggest attempt yet to win credibility on immigration in time for next year's general election. In a speech today, Ms Cooper will again concede that the last government got things wrong, adding: "We need to know how many people are arriving and leaving and what the impact will be. And we need to make sure the rules are enforced and not abused.
"The next Labour government will introduce exit checks so that visas can be enforced and action can be swiftly taken to make sure people leave when their time runs out."
Critics say it would be tough to implement and cost millions.
The plan goes further than the Coalition's scheme to reintroduce exit checks.
