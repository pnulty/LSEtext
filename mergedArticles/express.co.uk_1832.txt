A MAN who cannot be named for legal reasons but referred to as JR arrived in this country at 15 on a temporary visa to visit his mother. Refused permission to stay, he did anyway and a few months later stabbed a schoolboy of 15 to death over a drug debt.
He was jailed and, upon release, appealed against deportation. That appeal was rightly rejected so he appealed again, stating for the first time in this long saga that it would be dangerous for him to return to Jamaica because he is gay.
Astoundingly this appeal has been upheld so this nasty murderer is free to stay in Britain, despite the best efforts of Theresa May to get rid of him.
There is now so much anxiety about large numbers of lawful migrants from eastern Europe that we have begun to forget just how badly abused our asylum laws are and this case should act as a sharp reminder.
Any illegal immigrant has only to utter three words: I claim asylum. Then he or she will stay in the country while the claim is assessed and as we have no identity cards, a flourishing black economy and make limited use of detention it is a very easy country in which to disappear.
The international convention governing asylum was enacted to prevent any repetition of the appalling events of the 1930s when boatloads of Jews had been turned away at port after port, with the result that many perished in horrendous circumstances under the Nazi regime.
International law now says that anybody fleeing persecution must be given a safe haven and nobody must be sent back to his country of origin if it would put him in danger. That was just, but the world has moved on since 1951 when that decree came into being.
Then there was very little civilian air travel but now people can cross the globe in 24 hours. Then there was only limited television but now anyone in the Third World eking out an existence in a makeshift hut, with tarpaulin for a roof if lucky, can see daily images of the West, where even the poorest are housed and adequately fed, where the shops are piled high with goods and the schools have roofs on.
That understandably is what they want for their own families.
In 1951 large tracts of the Third World were still colonised and run peaceably. The withdrawal of the West over succeeding years gave rise to wars, genocide and persecution and, more frequently, the collapse of economies under incompetent and corrupt regimes.
The impetus to escape was huge and Britain is seen as a soft touch, which is why the people at Sangatte do not apply to stay in France but spend their days trying to get unlawfully into Britain.
We will not stop the abuse of our asylum system until we automatically detain all new applicants so that we know where they are, until immigration officers routinely meet planes so that they know exactly which country asylum seekers have come from and until we deport those who commit serious crimes.
After all, if they need safety it should not be granted at the expense of the safety of our own nationals. I am sorry if JR would suffer in Jamaica for being gay but I am vastly more sorry for the teenage victim who died at his hands.
The first duty of government is to keep its citizens from harm.

Other faiths not offended by David Cameron's speech on Christianity
David Cameron is right to claim that this country is a Christian one. Christianity has been vital to the formation of Britain and infuses our history and heritage. We have an established Church, the big ceremonies of state are based on the Christian religion and nearly 60 per cent of the nation regards itself as Christian according to the census.
The usual suspects in the form of militant atheists and those who make a habit of taking offence on behalf of others are now claiming such a statement of the obvious to be inappropriate in a multi-faith society. Offensive to whom?
Certainly followers of other faiths do not find it offensive that Christians maintain their own. Rather they are baffled when we do not. Has the Board of Deputies of British Jews complained? Has the Muslim Council berated the Prime Minister? No, just the usual bigots who think that because they have no faith nobody else is entitled to act on one.
So keep on talking Christianity, Prime Minister, even if you do regularly ride roughshod over the Church’s beliefs.

How nasty to stop children building a den
The Northumbria Police are to be congratulated on taking complaints of anti-social behaviour seriously but did they really have to intervene when a group of innocent kids built a den in the woods and played there, taking picnics?
The youngsters were told off and sent home. Apparently some snooty dog-walker had complained that the den interfered with Fido’s usual amble.
Many of us will remember a time when if police or dog walkers had come upon a scene of den-making they would have briefly joined in.
The parents of these children should tell them to carry on with their den and should threaten the police with an official complaint if they interfere.
As for the dog walkers the police should politely point out that they don’t own the woods any more than do the children.
The countryside is there for all to enjoy: adults, children and animals alike.

BGT is another string to Lettice's bow
Lettice Rowbotham has been declared the poshest contestant on Britain's Got Talent [PA]
First there were grumbles that BGT’s dancing granny had already won a talent contest in Spain and now there is carping that Lettice the violinist has already played for Prince Charles.
The idea of talent shows is not to exclude anybody who has ever performed outside a village hall but to gain recognition for excellence.
Last year’s fourth place went to Steve Hewlett the ventriloquist who has performed on cruise ships and in panto for years. It was a chance to gain a wider audience.
Good luck to them all, performing dogs and virtuoso violinists alike.

Some things on bucket list are beyond the pail
If I were composing a bucket list of 50 things to do in Great Britain before I die the very last things I would include would be to find myself in the bedlam of Harrods on the first day of the sales, gawking at those miles of illuminations in Blackpool and eating haggis on Burns’ Night. Yuk!
Those are just three of the suggestions compiled from a survey of 1,000 British adults.
Other ideas include whale watching in Welsh waters and watching the sun come up over Stonehenge on midsummer’s day.
For me the essence of Britain is never much further away than my own garden.
To listen to birdsong must surely be the greatest and most attainable enjoyment of our entire kingdom.
