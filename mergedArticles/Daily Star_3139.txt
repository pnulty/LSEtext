AN illegal immigrant raped a vulnerable 14-year-old girl a month after he should have been deported.
Evil Afghan Hamidullah Hamidi, 19, lured her off the street and back to his home with money.
Then when the girl - who has learning difficulties, giving her a mental age of seven - finally fled, he chased her until a member of the public flagged down a passing police car.
Judge Michael Longman jailed Hamidi for six years and ordered that he be deported halfway through his sentence. He told him: "Your victim was just 14 when you raped her.
"She was an extremely vulnerable girl. You caused her severe psychological harm."
Hamidi, from Bristol, was smuggled to the UK as a child by his mother to stop him being recruited by the Taliban, the city's crown court heard.
He should have been deported in November 2013 but offi-cials could not find him. He raped the girl in December.
Stephen Mooney, defending, said: "He has thrown away all that he has in this country."
