Kevin McKenna on immigration (Scotland edition, last week) clearly perceives racism as a nascent problem in Scotland and "the tendrils of this creeping disease" as only recently arrived there. As a native with a Scottish mother and a father born in England to an Irish father and a mother whose family was Welsh, I have always been aware of the anti-English sentiments of many Scots. So normal is this attitude that people routinely express this resentment without any reaction from others. So I was quite unsurprised by McKenna's description of the verbal abuse suffered by the African street musician in Glasgow. My Devonian husband, an Aberdonian for more than 50 years, recently held the door of a local shop for an elderly man whose reply to my husband's friendly "Morning!" was: "English bastard."
So McKenna thinks "Scotland needs more immigration". He fails to add the blatant nationalistic subtext - just so long as it's not from England.
