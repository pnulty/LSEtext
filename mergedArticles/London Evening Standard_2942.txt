IMMIGRATION minister James Brokenshire today appeared to seal the fate of an A-level student facing deportation to her native Mauritius after ruling her removal is "appropriate".
A total of 160,000 people signed a petition demanding that Yashika Bageerathi, 19, is allowed to stay.
Yashika came to London with her mother and younger brother and sister in 2011 to escape a relative who was physically abusive. The family claimed asylum last summer but all face deportation.
Two attempts to deport her have so far failed after two airlines refused to let her board flights.
