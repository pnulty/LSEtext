DOWNING Street last night defended the PM's decision to employ a foreign-born nanny.
Sources insisted neither David nor Samantha Cameron wrote a letter of endorsement to help Nepalese Gita Lima become a UK citizen.
Labour demanded to be told of any contact between the Camerons and the Home Office. A No10 spokesperson said: "The nanny came here, worked hard and is now a British citizen."
The row erupted after Tory Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said the wealthy elite were gaining from cheap migrant labour.
