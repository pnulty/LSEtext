Nigel Farage could find himself challenged by millions of students at next year's General Election if a controversial motion to be debated at this week's National Union of Students (NUS) conference in Liverpool is agreed. The leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (Ukip), who last week bested Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg in a televised debate on European Union membership, is accused in the motion of leading a party of the "nationalist right", the rise of which should be challenged.
Students will debate whether their union "should be alarmed by the electoral rise of a 'respectable' nationalist right, including UKIP" and that "we must fight the idea there is a problem with immigration".
The motion goes on to state whether the NUS should "make opposition to Ukip and the nationalist right a central part of our campaigning in the run up to the general election" and whether to oppose any withdrawal from the European Union.
The NUS, which represents more than 7 million students throughout Britain, is expecting around 1,000 delegates to vote and thus decide on its political direction for the next year at the conference which begins tomorrow and runs until Thursday.
