LABOUR needs a "straight-talking leader" who is comfortable drinking a pint to reconnect with working-class voters and reverse Labour's slide in the polls, the woman who torpedoed Gordon Brown's re-election chances has said.
Gillian Duffy said Ed Miliband was a "privileged" career politician who lacked the authenticity of Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader. Four years ago Mrs Duffy, a Rochdale pensioner, was called a "bigoted woman" by Mr Brown after she tackled him on immigration issues in the run-up to the last election.
