FIVE illegal workers were discovered in a raid on an restaurant.
Officers from Home Office Immigration Enforcement visited the Pearl Restaurant Bar and Lounge in Audenshaw and arrested a 23-year-old Pakistani man who had overstayed his visa, two Pakistani men, aged 26 and 33, who were working in breach of their visas and a 32-year-old Bangladeshi man who had entered the country illegally.
They all currently remain in detention. A 27-year-old Pakistani man who had overstayed his visa was not arrested but placed on immigration bail.
Paul Airlie, head of the Manchester Home Office Immigration Enforcement team, said: "We are happy to work with employers who want to play by the rules but those which continue to flout them will face heavy financial penalties."
