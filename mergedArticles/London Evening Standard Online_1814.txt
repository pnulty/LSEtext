A former head of the Army today rounded on Nigel Farage for a poster showing the Union Jack on fire.
Lord Dannatt said the Ukip ad  was “disrespectful and inappropriate” and treated the national flag as a political football.
The intervention of the former Chief of the General Staff is a blow to Mr Farage’s claim to stand up for Britain.
It came as David Cameron issued a  St George’s Day video message to proclaim his own English patriotism.

The posted shows a Union Jack burning with a caption: “Who really runs this country? 75 per cent of our laws are now made in Brussels.”
But Lord Dannatt told the Telegraph: “I’m certainly not happy about it. We should respect and revere the Union flag and not involve it in the way that it is being involved in a political campaign. It will be counter-productive.”
Mr Farage claimed only the “chattering classes” would be offended by Ukip’s controversial posters, which have been branded “racist” by rivals for their criticism immigration.
