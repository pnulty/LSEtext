The new trailer for the forthcoming sci-fi movie Jupiter Ascending starring Mila Kunis, Sean Bean and Eddie Redmayne has appeared online
The new trailer for the forthcoming sci-fi movie Jupiter Ascending appeared online on Wednesday.
The epic, released this July, is written and directed by the Wachowskis, famed for the Matrix trilogy and V for Vendetta.
It features a star-studded cast, with Mila Kunis taking the lead as Jupiter Jones and Channing Tatum as Caine. Other stars include Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne, Douglas Booth and Tuppence Middleton.
Set in the distant future, the movie centres on Kunis's character, a lowly Russian immigrant who cleans toilets for a living in a universe where gods rule over humans.
It happens that when she was born, the stars’ alignment meant her DNA could signify her as the next Queen of the Universe.
She comes into contact with Caine, a genetically engineered ex-military hunter, who has been sent to kill her by the Queen of the Universe, but ends up trying to protect her.
The trailer opens with a person in medical dress ordering that Jupiter be killed. Caine rescues her, and she is told ‘you are royalty’.
‘You are in for a surprise when you find out what I do for a living’, Jupiter responds.
English actor Eddie Redmayne, as villain Balem The King, then comes on to the scene declaring ‘I want her found and I want her dead.’
The battle for our world then commences, the trailer ending with Jupiter falling into a ravine with the tagline ‘Expand your Universe’.
Jupiter Ascending will be released in UK cinemas on July 18
