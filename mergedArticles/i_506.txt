Another week, another crackdown on benefit claims by migrants. The Government's latest measures tick three important boxes: immigration, welfare and Europe.
The timing looks suspiciously close to next month's European Parliament elections, when the UK Independence Party looks likely to come first or second. In fact, the restrictions on child benefit claims are unfinished business from the curbs on jobseeker's allowance and housing benefit since January.
Some eyebrows will be raised at the Liberal Democrats' support, especially as the much-predicted influx of Romanians and Bulgarians has failed to materialise. The new measures will not sound very "liberal" to the Government's critics, who insist that migrants contribute more in taxes than they claim in benefits.
To be fair, Nick Clegg did speak about the benefits of immigration in the first of his two broadcast debates with Nigel Farage. The Deputy Prime Minister insists that being pro-European does not mean being "soft" on migrants who abuse the system. Nor does he oppose all the EU reforms that David Cameron wants to see - such as stopping a Polish plumber claiming child benefit for his kids who still live in Warsaw. That is next on the Government's hit list.
Reducing access to interpreters at Jobcentre Plus offices appears to be a "dog whistle" aimed at potential Ukip voters. It ignores the inconvenient truth that unemployment amongst the ethnic minorities is 14 per cent, almost double the 7.2 per cent level in the population as a whole.
