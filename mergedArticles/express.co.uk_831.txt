MIKE TYSON has cancelled his upcoming theatre tour after failing to resolve visa issues.
The former boxer's Undisputed Truth shows were thrown into jeopardy late last year when Tyson was refused entry to the country due to a change in immigration law which bars convicts previously sentenced to more than four years in prison.
Tyson vowed to work with authorities to resolve the visa issues ahead of his planned theatre shows, but he has been unable to find a solution and his tour has now been cancelled.
He says in a statement, "I am truly grateful for my U.K. fans and have always considered this country my second home so it is disheartening that I am no longer granted entry. I hope at some point I will be allowed entry back into the country that has afforded me so many cherished memories. In the meantime, I send my sincerest apologies to my fans that purchased tickets and have been inconvenienced by this due process. Please understand this is all out of my control. I was looking forward to performing and meeting you all. I hope in the near future I am still given the opportunity to do so."
Tyson was freed in 1995 after serving half of a six-year jail term for rape.
Ticketholders to the March shows will be given full refunds.
