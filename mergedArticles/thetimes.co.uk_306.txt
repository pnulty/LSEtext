Dido Belle “was an authentic London immigrant”, writes Paula Byrne, who estimates that some 15,000 black people were living in the city in the late 18th century. Dr Johnson, for one, employed a black manservant. Belle was a beautiful young mixed-race woman, adopted and treated tenderly by the family of Lord Mansfield. As the Lord Chief Justice of England he presided over the “Zong” case, a claim against the insurers of a shipping company for the deliberate drowning at sea of 132 slaves. Lord Mansfield’s ruling laid a legal foundation for the abolition of slavery in Britain. Belle is an attractive figure in English high society and provides Byrne with a poignant human interest story. This contrasts neatly with the dramatic legal issues scrupulously upheld as a matter of principle by Mansfield. The theatrical zest of the narrative, which is a tie-in with a movie of the same name released next month, holds it all together.
