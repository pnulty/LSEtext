FRUSTRATED plane passengers returning to Britain last night started fighting as a computer glitch led to huge queues at UK airports.
Immigration desks at Heathrow, Gatwick, stansted and Birmingham airports were affected. Anger spilled over at Gatwick as long queues of people arriving at the North and South terminals started to merge. Kay Perry, who landed from Majorca, said: "No one really knew where they were meant to join so fights broke out."
The glitch hit UK Border Force computers yesterday afternoon. The resulting delays mainly affected inbound passengers at passport control. Extra staff were brought in to try to cut queues.
A Government spokesman said: "We are working to rectify this. Our priority remains security of the border."
