A STUDENT due to be deported from Britain yesterday was still in the country last night after her removal was delayed.
Mauritian-born Yashika Bageerathi, 19, was given tickets by the Home Office for a 5pm flight from Heathrow to her homeland.
But then she was told she would not be on the plane.
Lawyers for her school — Oasis Academy Hadley in Enfield, North London — are seeking a High Court injunction to prevent the A-level student being deported. One appeal has already failed.
Head teacher Lynne Dawes said: “Yashika was told she wouldn’t be on the flight, but we don’t know why."
Yashika came to the UK with her mother, younger brother and sister in 2011 to escape a physically abusive relative. But all four were refused asylum and face deportation.
Yashika has spent the last 12 days at Yarl’s Wood Immigration Removal Centre in Bedfordshire.
She told Sky News last night: “I just want to be with my mum right now and celebrate Mother’s Day."
