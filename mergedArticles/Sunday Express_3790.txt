THE number of elderly Scots being rushed to hospital after suffering a serious fall has soared to almost 40 a day, sparking concerns about the NHS's ability to cope with the country's ageing population.
According to the latest figures, there were 14,346 emergency admissions among over-75s as a result of a fall last year - up from 13,355 the previous year.
The annual total has risen by almost a third over the past decade, while 2,769 elderly Scots have been killed by falls over the past five years.
The numbers were unearthed by the Scottish Conservatives, who said the trend highlighted the additional pressures likely to face Scottish hospitals over the years ahead.
Health spokesman Jackson Carlaw MSP said: "While it is extremely welcome that people are living longer there are clearly problems emerging with that.
"The fact 276 people aged 75 and over are being rushed to casualty every week as a result of a fall is extremely worrying.
"Unless we take urgent action, this number will only increase as our population ages."
He said the Scottish Government has been "particularly poor" in planning for the fact that Scotland's population is ageing more quickly than in England and Wales, largely as a result of higher immigration there.
Mr Carlaw said that the SNP has to "face up to this demographic timebomb" and added: "As we know from these figures, a fall at home for a frail person can be fatal, but it can also leave lasting impacts for the rest of a person's life.
"Our NHS is already stretched to the limit, so if we can reduce these admissions that would allow nurses to focus on other challenges within our healthcare system."
Managing the consequences of falls is already estimated to cost the NHS and other public bodies in excess of Â£470 million a year in Scotland alone.
Last night, campaigners said that elderly people should be supported so they can live safely and independently for as long as possible.
However, they warned that the level of support on offer varies dramatically from one part of the country to another.
Some areas have services such as exercise classes to help maintain balance, while other areas have relatively little.
A spokeswoman for Age Scotland said more work and funding is needed to prevent falls, and added: "Falls are the main cause of disability and the leading cause of death from injury among people aged over 75 in the United Kingdom.
"They also destroy confidence, increase isolation and reduce independence, often hastening a move into residential care.
"Exercise programmes designed to improve strength and balance can lead to significant reductions in falls. But such services are not always available to everyone who needs them at the right time to help them with health and fitness."
