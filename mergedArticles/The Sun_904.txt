THE old saying "it's the economy, stupid" remains true and it's the phrase that will decide next year's General Election.
But the question is, which party will the economy help? YouGov's poll found that the Tories trounce Labour by two to one when voters were asked who they trust most to keep the economy growing. Labour leads by the same huge margin on making sure ordinary people's wages keep up with inflation.
In the long run, the economy and living standards go hand in hand. Millions think differently on these two things. That's why David Cameron talks about Britain's growth numbers, which are beginning to perk up, while Ed Miliband stresses the "cost of living crisis", which voters feel.
In our poll, more think they are worse off than a year ago.
Nick Clegg hopes voters will think that the best thing the Coalition has done - raising the personal tax allowance to £10,000 - was a Lib Dem idea.
Ukip's Nigel Farage is gaining ground by blaming our troubles on Europe and immigration.
Our poll shows all four party leaders have a message that chimes with voters. But which will have the greatest impact?
