CHANCELLOR George Osborne was given a boost yesterday with the news that a record 100,000 new jobs were created last month.
That equates to 3,300 workers being hired every day, or 1.2million a year.
If the positive trend continues, it will push employment to a record high of more than 31.5m by next May’s ­General Election.
Chris Williamson, chief economist at research group Markit which produced the figures, said: “With the outlook brightening, the pace of job creation hit a record high.”
And in another show of confidence for the Chancellor’s financial policies, he was given a pat on the back by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The international watchdog praised him for sticking to his economic plan.
But their backing will be a blow to Labour’s Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who have consistently criticised the Chancellor’s austerity plans only to see the recovery take off.
Labour has put the “cost of living crisis” at the heart of its economic message.
But with inflation at 1.6%, its lowest level for nearly five years, and wages rising, the squeeze on families could be coming to an end.
Mr Osborne said the ­latest forecasts were a vote of confidence in the UK’s long-term economic plan.
