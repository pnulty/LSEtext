BRITAIN has the most "in your face" sexist culture in the world, says a United Nations expert.
Rashida Manjoo, who is a UN special rapporteur on violence against women, claimed the UK was home to a "boys' club sexist culture".
Following a 16-day visit to the UK she also claimed that Government cutbacks had hit services designed to curb violence against women.
Ms Manjoo complained that she was blocked from entering the controversial immigration detention centre for women at Yarl's Wood in Bedfordshire.
The South African human rights expert said the UK's main focus of legal and policy responses focused on harmful practices, such as early and forced marriages but ignored the harms coming from "a sexist culture that exists in the country".
She said: "Have I seen this level of sexist culture in other countries? It hasn't been so in-your-face in other countries.
"What is clear from these indications of portrayals of women and girls is that there is a boys' club sexist culture."
A Home Office spokeswoman said: "Violence against women and girls in any form is unacceptable and the Government has shown its commitment to ending it."
