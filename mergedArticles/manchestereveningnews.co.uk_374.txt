Engineers have worked through the night at Manchester Airport to fix an IT glitch causing long queues at immigration.
The fault affected UK Border Force computers at airports across the country yesterday afternoon, leading to travel disruption.
It mostly affected people trying to come in to the country - particularly non-EU airline customers.
A Border Force spokesman said Manchester was one of the less affected sites, adding: “We are currently experiencing temporary IT problems which may add to the time taken to conduct passport checks.
“We are working to rectify this issue and are providing extra staff to get passengers through the controls as quickly as possible. Our priority remains security of the border.
“We apologise for any additional time this adds to passengers’ journeys.”
Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said: “Our engineers have been working through the night to fix the temporary IT problems that regrettably led to longer queues for some passengers at passport controls yesterday.
“The current situation is much improved and we are doing our best to keep waiting times to a minimum during this morning’s busy period.
“We apologise for any delays but security must remain our priority at all times.”
