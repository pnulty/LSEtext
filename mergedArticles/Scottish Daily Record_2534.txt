SCOTLAND will need 60,000 working age immigrants every year to maintain the current level of state pensions, it was claimed yesterday.
Almost triple the current levels of immigration would be needed to defuse Scotland's pensions timebomb and pay taxes to keep public services running, experts said.
Professor Robert Wright, of Strathclyde University, told MPs on Westminster's Scottish affairs committee: "The longer we wait, the harder it is to address. The population is ageing and it is time to make some tough decisions."
Wright said that double the rate of net migration, currently 25,000 a year, would not be enough.
Stirling University economics professor David Comerford estimated the figure would be 60,000 a year.
Wright said: "Some people argue that it is not fixable and that you can only expect the standard of living to fall.
"It is going to be a mix of policies that are very difficult political decisions to make."
He said measures from closing schools to privatisations would be needed to maintain the standard of living, either under independence or in the UK.
