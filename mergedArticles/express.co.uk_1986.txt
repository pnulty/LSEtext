SCANDAL-hit outsourcer Serco Group had £300million wiped off its market value yesterday after a profit alert and warned it may have to raise funds to shore up its finances.
The FTSE 250 company, which had to repay £68.5million to the UK Government for overcharging on contracts to tag criminals, issued the latest in a string of profit warnings after the market closed on Monday.
Serco, where Rupert Soames, a grandson of Sir Winston Churchill takes over as chief executive next month, said it is reviewing its performance so far this year, which has been “more challenging than expected”.
It added: “It has now become evident in the light of recent performance that we may need to reassess the level of risk implicit in the assumptions underlying our forecasts. We will be consulting with shareholders regarding the possibility of strengthening the balance sheet through an equity placing.”
Analysts pointed to an immigration detention contract in Australia as a source of Serco’s latest woes and suggested it may have to tap investors for up to £500million. Serco shares plunged 60¾p to 343¾p.
