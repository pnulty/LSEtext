Handouts 10x bigger for Bulgs
BRITAIN'S handouts are up to TEN times more generous than in Romania and Bulgaria.
A Sun investigation found housing benefit in Romania pays just £40 per week and does not exist in Bulgaria — but claimants here can get up to £500.
And Britain's jobless can claim £71.70 a week, while Romanians get £29 and Bulgarians £50. Both nations offer the benefit for just a year and only if the person has worked for a decade.
Tory MP Nigel Mills said: "Whether you're coming to work or claim benefits, Britain is a very attractive option. You fare so much better off here."
Our findings come as official stats show 168,000 more European workers came to the UK in the past year alone — taking the total to 1.74million.
The number of Romanians and Bulgarians in work in the UK FELL by 4,000 since EU restrictions were lifted on January 1. However, the total for the two nations in the 12 months as a whole was up 29,000 compared to a year ago to 140,000.
Critics pointed out yesterday's figures do not include dependants and immigrants out of work. And Tory Defence Minister Anna Soubry admitted the Government does not "seem to be on course" to meet its pledge of reducing net migration to below 100,000.
