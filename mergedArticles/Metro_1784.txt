The book of drunks banned from Dundee pubs in 1905 is sold for £1,500
A BOOK depicting mugshots of drunkards in 1905 - so that publicans could keep them out of their bars - has sold for £1,500.
Robert Wightman bought the book of police pictures for more than three times its estimated value after being fascinated by its part in illustrating the history of his home city of Dundee.
The book depicts dozens of residents whose bad behaviour got them banned from local pubs.
It was valued at around £400 but Mr Wightman spent £1,500 at the Curr and Dewar auction in the city yesterday. He said: 'I wanted to buy it because it is a part of the history of Dundee.' The collection of 40 faces is of mainly women and Irish immigrants, the youngest being just 16 years old and the oldest 63.
Among them is fish dealer John Boyd, a 46-year-old of 'proportionate' build, who was convicted at Dundee's police court after he was found 'in a state of intoxication' on November 13, 1905. Under 'peculiarities or marks', the report notes 'left eye awanting'.
