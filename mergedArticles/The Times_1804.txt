A £500 million government programme to count people in and out of Britain electronically cannot be used to estimate levels of immigration, ministers said yesterday.
Information from the Home Office's e-Borders scheme, initiated by Labour, cannot replace the current system because it will not collect details of how long migrants intend to stay in Britain.
The Home Office said that it would be illegal under EU law on the free movement of people for officials to ask travellers routinely how long they intended to stay or the reason for their visit.
The disclosure came in an official response to the Commons public administration committee, which had described the existing system, the International Passenger Survey, as "not fit for purpose". MPs on the committee said that the IPS, which interviews arriving passengers, was "inadequate for measuring the levels of migration that are now typical in the UK".
The Home Office rejected the committee's dismissal of IPS, saying that it backed the view of the UK Statistics Authority that the survey remained as reliable and accurate as possible and was "currently the best available estimate of net migration".
