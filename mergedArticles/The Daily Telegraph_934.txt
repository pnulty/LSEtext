THE WEEK'S BEST FILMS
Monsieur Lazhar (2011)
FILM4, 11.00AM ****
An Algerian immigrant (Mohamed Fellag) offers his services to a school when he learns of a popular school teacher committing suicide in her classroom. While trying to help the children cope with their grief, he also has a secret tragedy of his own and is in a constantly precarious position as a refugee. Philippe Falardeau's film is both raw and thought–provoking, led by a stellar performance from Fellag.
The Man in the Iron Mask (1998)
5*, 6.30PM **
Randall Wallace (Braveheart) made his directorial debut with this loose adaptation of Alexandre Dumas's 1848 novel. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in a duel role as the title character and villain, though isn't convincing as either. The ageing musketeers (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gérard Depardieu and Gabriel Byrne) plot how to overcome the brutal King Louis XIV (DiCaprio) using his secret twin brother.
Unknown (2011)
FILM4, 9.00PM **
Roman Polanski didn't direct this delirious Euro–pudding, but he might have done, if forcefed the wrong kind of mushroom and reminded about his 1988 thriller, Frantic. Liam Neeson has the comparable role of a biotech scientist visiting Berlin, who mislays his passport, all proof of his identity, and the plot. His wife (January Jones, flubbing cool Hitchcock blonde duties) denies all knowledge. Clunky and laughable but never dull.
The Life of David Gale (2003)
ITV3, 11.10PM ***
Kate Winslet, Kevin Spacey and Laura Linney all deliver expectedly fine performances in this gripping but convoluted thriller from Alan Parker. David Gale (Spacey), an opponent of capital punishment, ends up, with bitter irony, on death row after being found guilty of the rape and murder of a fellow activist. Gale agrees to tell his story to a nervy journalist (Winslet), who's convinced he's innocent.
The New World (2005)
FILM4, 1.10AM ***
This vivid retelling of the Pocahontas story stars Q'orianka Kilcher as the young Indian chief's daughter and Colin Farrell as the English captain with whom she has a passionate affair. Terrence Malick's magnificent visual imagination is in full flight and there is glorious cinematography throughout, but the self–indulgent slow pacing means that it is perhaps more to be admired than enjoyed.
