A KENYAN fraudster stole more than Â£26,000 in benefits - after being denied permission to stay in the UK.
Lucy Mbugua had already been ordered to leave the country when she launched the four-year scam.
Amazingly, she was then allowed to stay - AFTER being charged over her crimes.
The 40-year-old mother was convicted of three offences of dishonestly claiming taxpayers' cash while having no right to remain in the UK.
She was found guilty in her absence and also failed to turn up to be sentenced at Birmingham Magistrates' Court.
A warrant was issued for Mbugua's arrest - but the Mail tracked her down to her home in Westminster Road, Selly Oak, before police caught up with her. She told our reporter that she failed to attend court because of childcare issues, but would not comment further on the case.
Her convictions were welcomed by Birmingham City Council.
