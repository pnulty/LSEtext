WOULD-be Ukip councillor William Henwood said Lenny Henry should emigrate to a 'black country' after the comedian said there should be more ethnic minorities in creative industries.
Defending his Twitter remark, the Ukip candidate later told the BBC: 'I think if black people come to this country and don't like mixing with white people why are they here?
'If he (Henry) wants a lot of blacks around go and live in a black country.'
In previous tweets Mr Henwood, 66, has compared Islam to the Nazi Third Reich. He wrote: 'Islam reminds me of the 3rd Reich. Strength through violence against the citizens.'
Mr Henry, 55, is the son of Jamaican immigrants and was born and raised in Dudley, West Midlands. He shot to fame as a comedian and has recently performed to great critical acclaim in Shakespeare.
Earlier this month he said that he wanted the public to join his campaign to put more ethnic minorities on the screen. Ukip has already launched an investigation into another of its aspiring politicians after apparently homophobic and racist comments came to light.
On March 29, the day gay marriage was made legal in the UK, Robert Bilcliff, who is standing to be a councillor in Tamworth, Staffordshire, wrote on Twitter: 'Sad day for all us straight people.'
In a separate Facebook post in July 2012 he allegedly made a joke against Muslims.
