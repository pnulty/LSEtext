IT'S all coming tumbling down for JUSTIN BIEBER - including his pants.
The Canadian singer lifted his arms to go through the full body scanner at LAX airport and nearly lost his kecks, right.
Justin was detained by US immigration officials for FIVE HOURS on his return from Japan. After the lengthy grilling he left the airport in different trousers, clutching the belt to preserve his modesty, below.
While in Japan, he upset fans by visiting a controversial shrine which honours notorious Second World War criminals.
And earlier this year almost 300,000 people signed a White House petition demanding: "Deport Justin Bieber!" No update on this yet, sadly.
