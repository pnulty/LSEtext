OPINION
JUST ONE week on from assurances that the coalition would make it easier for us to see GPs out of hours comes news that in some parts of the country it is well nigh impossible to see them even in the middle of the day.
How have we allowed matters to come to this? The problem, as with so much wrong in our society, stems from the last Labour government: in its irresponsible attitude towards immigration it encouraged so many people to move here that the social services, including the NHS, can't cope.
The outcome has been that people who can't get doctor's appointments are going to A&E, thus putting pressure on hospitals, which in turn will not be able to function efficiently.
The NHS is already on its sickbed, overburdened by bureaucracy and with resources stretched to breaking point. If this situation isn't dealt with the illness will be terminal. Is that what Labour strove for?
