HEALING PRAISE FOR INTEGRATION Scots football team for refugees fleeing war zones hailed by Oxford Uni experts
AN extraordinary Scots football team who have transformed the lives of refugees have been praised by experts at Oxford University.
United Glasgow FC, who boast players from more than 20 countries including Somalia, Congo and Pakistan, have been hailed as an example of how sport brings people together.
Following a study, Oxford's Refugee Studies Centre praised them as an example of how to help immigrants and refugees, many of whom have fled war zones, adjust to their new lives.
They called the team "not merely an integration of foreigners into society, but a new creation, where the identity as a footballer overrides ethnic, racial and national identities".
The multicultural team, who play at the Firhill Complex and Pollok Park in Glasgow, were set up by equality worker Alan White in 2011.
Alan said: "There are so many nationalities and religions that nobody feels out of place."
Nick Ikunda, who fled Congo with his family when he was 12 to escape war, plays for the team in the Scottish Unity Football League.
He said: "It was hard to adjust but I love Glasgow. A football team like this is great.
"We are all close friends and are all from different backgrounds."
Head coach Euan McLeod was delighted by Oxford's endorsement.
He said: "When we come together, nationality and religion are never mentioned."
