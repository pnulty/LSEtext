Three Pounds in My Pocket
Radio 4, 11.00am
Fascinating documentary by Kavita Puri and her father . He came to Britain from India in 1959 with £3 in his pocket, a sum determined by Indian authorities to regulate currency outflow. She grew up with the stories of people like his, arriving with little, going on to make a success of their families' lives. Her father was a maths graduate, aged 29, who came to work in engineering in Middlesbrough. It wasn't what he expected. It rained a lot, But people were kind and he managed, as did others of his immigrant generation. First part of three.
Friday Night Is Music Night
Radio 2, 8.00pm
Special edition devoted to the fruitful 25–year musical partnership of Gilbert and Sullivan. From their 14 operettas, tonight's concert recalls favourites from The Mikado, The Pirates of Penzance, Iolanthe, Patience, The Gondoliers, Ruddigore and The Yeomen of the Guard. But there's also the first performance of In Days Gone By, a ballad cut from the first production of The Sorcerer and not heard until now. The BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by Richard Balcombe, is joined by London Voices and six sterling soloists. Ken Bruce presents.
