He has spent the last few months solidly campaigning for Britain to withdraw from the EU.
But it seems UKIP leader Nigel Farage has finally been won over by the Continent - at least if this video is to be believed.
A holiday company has poked fun at the anti-Europe MEP by taking his speeches and turning them into a declaration of his love for holidays abroad.
The mash-up of his talks and interviews even manages to turn his stance on immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria - changing it to a declaration of his intent to send more Britons on holiday to Eastern Europe.
The spoof video, released on the day of the European election, sees Mr Farage declaring: I love extended holidays in Europe.'
Brussels, normally the subject of the politician's wrath for its control of UK laws, is praised in the film, with the MEP saying: 'Brussels, I've been looked after beautifully.'
But the most ardent admiration is reserved for Romania and Bulgaria.
In the video, the UKIP leader declares: 'We want make sure millions of ordinary decent people out there enjoy Romania and Bulgaria on holiday.'
He goes on to declare: 'I'd pack be packing my bags now because, as I've often said, I love Europe, great place.'
The hilarious video was created by lastminute.com to promote its holidays to the Continent and is well-timed to coincide with one of the most important European elections in recent history.
The vote comes after the UKIP leader and Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg went head-to-head over two debates to discuss whether Britain should stay in the European Union or not.
