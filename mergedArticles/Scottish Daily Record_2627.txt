OUR story yesterday about a Scots father who has been separated from his wife and child due to immigration laws got our online community talking.
Phillip Malloy has been told his Japanese wife Kyoko and son Joshua will not be able to join him until he earns at least Â£18,000 a year.
Tim Bain wrote on our Facebook page: "The rules are there to stop arranged fake marriages but harm decent people because we're swamped and they don't have time to go into each case.
"There should be a court that people can go to with evidence to prove they are legitimate, independent of the immigration service."
Ralph Irvine added: "This affects thousands of genuine applicants. He'll need to try harder to get a better paid job. Studies can wait."
Paul Slacks said: "A wee change to allow immigration officers to look at each case on an individual basis would make sense. But they won't do it."
Tracey Reid said: "I'm from Australia but my grandfather was born in Scotland before he migrated to Australia as a child. Let this family be together."
