AMERICANAH by CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE Fourth Estate £8.99 ebook £4.99 Novels about immigration can inspire one to consider the similarities between the immigrant and the novelist. Both are acutely, even painfully, sensitive to the hidden implications of language. Novelists also endeavour to see the society around them with the clarity of the newly arrived. Such thoughts may occur to readers of Americanah — or at least to those readers who resist being so seduced by the love story at the novel's heart that they overlook its broader accomplishments and intellectual ambitions.
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, whose novel Half of a Yellow Sun won the 2007 Orange prize for fiction, is, like her heroine, Ifemelu, a Nigerian who has lived in America. She is a sharp observer, with a gift for capturing those aspects of culture that seem entirely normal to Africans and Americans. She is also clever enough to send Obinze, the other half of her star-crossed couple, to Britain, where he is obliged to contend with a somewhat different approach to the questions of race, nationality and social class.
Read Americanah to enjoy the chance to visit three continents, observe a wide array of subcultures and meet complicated and interesting characters — and to go wherever Adichie chooses to takes us. Francine Prose
