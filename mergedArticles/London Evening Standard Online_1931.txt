(c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited.   
A man and a woman have been charged with holding a man as a slave for 24 years after a raid by human trafficking police.
Emmanuel Edet, 59, and Antan Edet, 56, were due to appear in court today accused of holding someone in servitude. They are also accused of assisting unlawful immigration.
They were charged yesterday after being arrested by the Met's human trafficking unit.
It is claimed that a man was brought into the country in 1989 and was denied an education or access to his passport as he was moved around various addresses in England.
The alleged victim came forward to police at the end of last year and is now being supported by specialist charity workers.
Both were remanded in custody to appear at Hendon Magistrates' Court on Friday.
