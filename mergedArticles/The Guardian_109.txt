A new and more detailed British weather forecast model, made possible by increases in computing power, will allow the Met office to make accurate long-range predictions for the first time. Meterologists' forecasts for upcoming seasons are now only a slight improvement on chance, but when the model is fully functioning, it could offer up to 80% accuracy. While knowing the weather of the future won't make it any nicer, there will nevertheless be enormous benefits for both society and the economy. Here are just a few:
* Long-range shipping forecasts could help to protect fishermen crossing the Somerset Levels.
* Newspapers will be able to write scare stories about hosepipe bans months in advance.
1/8 Highly detailed UK weather predictions for the next five years could be published in order to deter immigration.
* Test matches can be declared a draw up to six months ahead of time.
* Once the warmest and sunniest fortnight of the coming British summer can be established during the previous winter, we can all tell Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary to stuff his effing carry-on restrictions.
* The foolish optimism that leads people to buy new barbecues on Easter Monday will be quashed for ever.
* Glastonbury festival planners will realise they need to invest in a roof, like Wimbledon.
* The stretch of Devon coast incorporating Torquay, Paignton and Brixham will now know in which seasons to use the motto the English Riviera in promotional materials, and when to switch to the English Scotland.
* Tiresome conversations about the weather can now be had early: "Well, that's the coming winter for you"; "This rain can't go on for ever, just another 11 weeks"; "See you next summer, in four years' time."
* People who hate picnics can now schedule them to coincide with future thunderstorms.
1/8 Long-range climate mapping could give rise to a whole new leisure industry: flood tourism.
