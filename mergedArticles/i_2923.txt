Police were last night investigating the sudden death of a 40-year-old woman at Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre.
The woman detainee died of a heart attack yesterday morning. Unconfirmed reports suggested that she had been offered paracetamol after complaining of chest pain.
Her death is said to have left tensions between inmates and staff at the centre in Bedfordshire "sky high".
A spokesman for the Home Office said: "Sadly, we can confirm the death of a female detainee at Yarl's Wood on 30 March.
"It would not be appropriate to comment further as the death is subject to a police investigation."
