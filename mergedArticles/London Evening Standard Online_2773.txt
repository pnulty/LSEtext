There was a "statistically significant" increase in the numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians arriving in the UK last year, official figures show, as the Government's target of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands slipped further away.
Some 24,000 citizens of Romania and Bulgaria arrived in the year to September 2013, nearly three times the 9,000 who arrived in the previous year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Around 70% came to work, while 30% came to study.
Meanwhile, overall net migration - the difference between migrants leaving and arriving in the UK - soared to 212,000 in the period from 154,000 the previous year, moving further away from Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May's hopes to bring the figure down to below 100,000 by the 2015 general election.
Some 532,000 people immigrated to the UK in the year ending September, up from the 497,000 people who arrived during the previous year, while 320,000 emigrants left the country, down from the 343,000 the previous year.
A surge in European Union citizens arriving in the UK has driven the increase, rising to 209,000 from 149,000 the previous year, the ONS said.
Some 65,000 citizens of so-called EU15 countries, that is pre-2004 members of the union, arrived to work in the UK in the period, an increase of 23,000 when compared to the previous year.
However, immigration of non-EU citizens saw a statistically significant decrease to 244,000 in the period, down from 269,000 the previous year.
Statisticians said this was due to fewer New Commonwealth citizens - such as those from India - migrating to the UK for formal study.
The drop in non-EU citizens is likely to fuel fears that Britain is being perceived as "closed for business" by foreign students who are seen by many as valuable to the British economy.
