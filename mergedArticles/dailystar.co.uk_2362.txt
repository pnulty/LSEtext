OVER £31,000 is being spent by the Department for Work and Pensions on a YouTube channel which has almost no viewers!
The department, which is headed by Iain Duncan Smith, produced 33 videos in the nine months between April 2013 and January 2014 which cost a whopping £31,046.52 to produce and averages out at £940.78 per video.
A Freedom of Information Request by Buzzfeed.com found that the sum for running the channel does not even cover the staffing costs of the "small in-house team" which produce the videos.
At the time of writing the DWP's channel had only 455 subscribers with some videos pulling in as little as SEVEN views.
Over a third of the videos have under 100 hits with topics ranging from universal credit, bedroom tax and personal hygiene with the latter wracking up a paltry nine views.
Another government department – The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills – beats the DWP with more than 1,000 subscribers but the official Cabinet Office channel falls short of both with only 139.
The amount that the DWP spent on its failing YouTube channel is enough to get 75 young unemployed people onto the government's Work Programme.
