UKIP leader Nigel Farage has sparked uproar after adopting a BNP slogan as his new election battle cry.
He launched the "Love Britain, Vote UKIP" motto at his party's spring conference, declaring: "It's ours now."
It prompted BNP leader Nick Griffin to brand UKIP a "BBC-produced knock-off copy of the BNP's alternative to out-of-touch old parties".
Labour MP Simon Danczuk blasted: "UKIP is becoming more extreme in a desperate attempt to win votes."
But Mr Farage defended the motto, saying: "We're claiming that territory. To hell with the BNP or anybody else."
In a speech in Torquay, Devon, he railed against mass immigration and bemoaned the lack of English spoken on trains.
He also said he'd quit as UKIP leader if his party did not win a Westminster seat next year. The Sun Says — Page Eight
