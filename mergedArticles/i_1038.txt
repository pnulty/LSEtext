How can it be that British voters are becoming less anti-European while at the same time migrating in droves to Ukip? That is the intriguing question posed by Pew's research. One explanation could be that the reason voters are now turning to Ukip is no longer just because of their traditional anti-European calling card.
Talk to voters in many constituencies and you find that the issue on which the Ukip message resonates is controlling the number of people who can come to Britain, work, use the NHS and put their children into school.
But not all these voters see the issue of immigration and Britain's membership of the EU as being one and the same - they are fearful over the impact on jobs if Britain were to pull out of the EU entirely.
That means it is entirely possible that across the wider electorate support for the EU could be increasing while support for Ukip could be rising.
