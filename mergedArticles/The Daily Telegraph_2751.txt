A director at the UK Border Agency with "unlimited access" to personal details gave information to her boyfriend so he could pose as a lawyer and defraud immigration applicants, a court heard.
Anjali Patel, 30, a former director at the agency, is also accused of jointly laundering more than £70,000 worth of criminal proceeds with Abdul Farooq, 27, her boyfriend. Mr Farooq fraudulently charged the immigration applicants as much as £13,000 for advice, Croydon Crown Court heard.
Miss Patel, from Addiscombe, southwest London, and Mr Farooq, from Waddon, south–west London, both deny all charges in relation to the alleged fraud and money laundering. The trial continues.
