IMMIGRANTS from within the European Union will head the list of newcomers to Britain for the first time, says a report.
MigrationWatch UK, which favours tougher immigration laws, said the economic crisis in southern Europe would continue to drive a huge influx to this country.
It predicted net migration from EU nations of about 130,000 a year and that such levels would be maintained for the "medium term".
The total of 520,000 over four years would exceed the population of Manchester, the study said.
The report also said overall net migration would be "in the order of 160,000 a year" – far higher than the Government's target of "tens of thousands" – once immigration from outside the EU was taken into account.
"If non–EU net migration does fall to about 100,000 per year and EU migration stays at around 130,000, it would become, for the first time, the main source of net migration," it added.
Sir Andrew Green, the chairman of MigrationWatch UK, said: "The Government is successfully bringing down immigration from outside the European Union, but we now face a situation where the numbers from inside the EU could form the majority of foreign migrants.
"This clearly poses a fundamental issue for our negotiations with the EU.
"It was crazy to have opened up our labour market and our benefit system to 100 million people from countries with a standard of living less than a quarter of our own."
Sir Andrew added: "There must now be a determined renegotiation."
The next set of current offi–cial immigration figures is due to be published next month.
