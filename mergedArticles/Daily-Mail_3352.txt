THE exam known as the entry 3 level ESOL is a language test for immigrants applying for British citizenship or to settle in the UK.
A total of 279 awarding bodies saw 283,650 people take the test in centres across the country last year.
It demands an intermediate level of 'conversational English' and assesses applicants on speaking, listening, reading and writing, based on the book 'Life in the United Kingdom: a Guide for New Residents'.
For the written element, the applicant is given an hour to write a 90-word letter and a 60-word email about a given topic - for example, asking a landlord about problems with a flat.
The reading test presents applicants with pieces of text including newspaper articles and emails. They must read the copy before answering multiple choice questions. They are asked to identify spelling mistakes.
For speaking and listening, the candidate must answer questions including 'What is your name?' and 'What do you enjoy doing in your spare time, before asking the examiner questions.
