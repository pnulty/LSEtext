A LONDON Tory MP today warned that his party's rigid immigration policy is harming the British economy.
Mark Field argued that the Government was now "hamstrung" by its stubborn focus on lowering net migration when it had limited control over the measure. The Cities of London and Westminster MP claimed the Government's crackdown was blocking talented students and skilled workers coming to the UK. He also warned party leaders against trying to "out-Ukip Ukip". His comments come before he is due to launch a new backbench group of Tory MPs which will aim to promote the positives of migration.
He said: "We'll try and make the case that Britain is open for business. I feel strongly, and businesses that I speak to agree, that we have to tone down the immigration rhetoric."
