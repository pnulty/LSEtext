Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, will today set out her "progressive" vision for immigration to the UK, pledging that Labour would safeguard growth sectors such as higher education from any immigration cap.
Ms Cooper will tell an audience in London that legitimate students coming to study at UK universities who paid their fees and return home would not count under any Labour government target.
She will admit that her party has historically "got things wrong" on immigration but will also hit out at the Conservatives by saying: "the coalition approach is failing".
"Top businesses are worried they can't get the high skills they need, the public are more concerned than ever - especially about the impact of EU migration," Ms Cooper is expected to say.
Her comments come just a week after research by university funding body HEFCE found the number of international students at English universities fell for the first time in nearly three decades as a result of increases in tuition fees and stricter visa rules.
Ms Cooper will argue the best way to deter low-skilled migration is to prevent employers exploiting cheap migrant labour to undercut wages, jobs and businesses. Gangmasters who bring in workers under false pretences will be rigorously prosecuted.
The Home Office said yesterday it was strengthening the Gangmasters Licensing Authority by boosting its links with the National Crime Agency.
