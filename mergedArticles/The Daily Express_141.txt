? GREAT Britain was hit yesterday by "killer dust storms" from the Sahara. I only mention this horror in case you didn't notice, except for a light dusting of muck on your motor car. Hysteria broke out in television newsrooms and on the streets - where Veggie, bearded Green drips riding bicycles donned face masks - and at Hickey Towers, when I saw the Alvis looking a trifle dusty. Taking immediate remedial action, I had a couple of the immigrants give it a wash and polish. A narrow squeak for us all, eh!
