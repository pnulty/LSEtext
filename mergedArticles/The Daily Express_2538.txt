VINCE Cable will today intensify the angry Coalition row over border controls by delivering an outspoken defence of mass immigration.
The Lib Dem Business Secretary will use a keynote speech in the City to accuse the Tories of putting the economy at risk by seeking to stem the tide of new arrivals.
"We just have to stop treating people coming to work here as if they are a problem; we need to kill all the scare stories," he will say, before going on to deny that migrants "sponge" off Britain's generous welfare system.
Mr Cable will admit that the issue has become "politically toxic" but will insist that politicians have a duty to confront anti-immigration views.
And he will declare: "I am intensely relaxed about people coming to work and study here."
His remarks to City chiefs at the Mansion House are bound to irritate Home Secretary Theresa May and infuriate Tory backbenchers.
Tory MP Philip Hollobone said: "Daily Express readers will be disappointed to hear that a senior member of the Cabinet holds these views."
Meanwhile, it has been claimed that middle-class demand for low-cost cleaners and builders has led to mass migration into Britain.
The Conservative Party's newly appointed immigration minister James Brokenshire is expected to accuse middle-class households and big businesses of supporting the mass immigration of foreign workers by their demand for cheap labour and services in a speech today.
He will say: "For too long the bene-fits of immigration went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services - but not to the ordinary hard-working people of this country." ? Downing Street was forced into an embarrassing denial yesterday that it had withheld an official report suggesting the impact of immigration is less than feared. No 10 insisted it would be published "shortly".
