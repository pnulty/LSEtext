THE week began for Gary Barlow with James Corden following him around for a television documentary that firmly established the Take That man as a national treasure and elder statesman of pop.
Is it harsh to strip Gary of his OBE title?[REX]
By the weekend, however, the most popular man with stubble in the country was being pilloried for taking part in a tax avoidance scheme with two other members of the band.
Strip him of his OBE howled various people’s tribunes, while the social media mob parodied his song titles – All I Do Each Night is PAYE was my favourite.
Considering some of the other people allowed on previous honours lists it seems a bit harsh to strip Barlow of his bauble.
But it would be rash to underestimate the sense of grievance in the country about rich pop stars/bankers, etc, who dodge paying their fair share.
The episode plays into the hands of the “them and us” narrative that Ed Miliband is so assiduously cultivating with his energy price freezes, rent controls and that Labour party political broadcast last week, which effectively declared class war.
Those are the sort of battle lines which, in the words of another of Gary’s hits, Ed would like to see brought Back For Good.

If I’m being honest my first reaction to the news that Britain’s first PoundPub has just opened in Atherton, near Wigan, Greater Manchester, was a bit snobbish.
I immediately concluded that it was the sort of place patronised by sad old boozers who drink as automatically as they draw breath .
But what was even more predictable than my instinctive first response was the chorus of doom-mongers calling the place “irresponsible” because it sells halves of beer for £1 and pints for £1.50 with the catchy slogan: “More round for your pound”.
Its boss insists anyone who looks the worse for wear isn’t served – and there’s no reason to believe that the police, who report no problems concerned with the business, won’t act accordingly at the first sign of any trouble.
The reaction to the PoundPub is merely the latest illustration of that enduring strain in the British character that relishes nothing more than disapproving of something.

Good Morning Britain's figures have continued to drop [GETTY]
Good Morning Britain’s viewing figures have been plummeting ever since it began broadcasting as ITV’s new breakfast show earlier this month, so much so that Chris Evans felt safe in cheekily referring to its main presenter Susanna Reid at an awards ceremony this week as “the former breakfast queen of British television”.
So when an angry Freddie Starr ordered Susanna out of his home after she quizzed him about previous allegations of sex offences I imagine that, far from being perturbed, she and the show’s producers could scarcely believe their luck.
Expect to see a procession of old entertainers provoked from now on in an effort to put the ratings up.

Ever since I was a kid growing up in West Yorkshire I’ve said “ta” – the diminutive of thank you – in everyday conversation.
My mum, despite being born and bred there herself, disapproved of such vulgar usage, just as she always tried to persuade me to say “bar-th” for “bath”.
She thought it would improve my future prospects.
I regret to report she failed in her endeavours.
Last week my 16-year-old son revealed – during one of those rare conversations we have now that doesn’t include the phrases “what time are you coming home?” and “so when exactly are you planning to revise?” – that his friends have expressed bafflement whenever he says “ta”.
Apparently it is an entirely alien phrase to young southern ears.
I’ve been self-conscious about using it ever since.
And what on earth must new immigrants to this country who pride themselves on at least knowing the terms “please” and “thank you” make of it?
