AN illegal immigrant raped a vulnerable 14-year-old girl a month after he should have been deported.
Evil Afghan Hamidullah Hamidi, 19, lured her off the street and back to his home with money.
Then when the girl – who has learning difficulties, giving her a mental age of seven – finally fled, he chased her until a member of the public flagged down a passing police car.
Judge Michael Longman
Judge Michael Longman jailed Hamidi for six years and ordered that he be deported halfway through his sentence.
He told him: “Your victim was just 14 when you raped her.
“She was an extremely vulnerable girl. You caused her severe psychological harm.”
Hamidi, from Bristol, was smuggled to the UK as a child by his mother to stop him being recruited by the Taliban, the city’s crown court heard.
He should have been deported in November 2013 but officials could not find him. He raped the girl in December.
Stephen Mooney, defending, said: “He has thrown away all that he has in this country.”
