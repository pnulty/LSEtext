AN incredible 350,000 MORE immigrants than previously believed flooded into Britain under Labour - equal to the population of Cardiff.
Red-faced stats chiefs released revised figures admitting they had dramatically underestimated the flow of people coming to the UK.
Between 2001 and 2011, an extra net foreigner immigration was 346,000 higher than thought. The peak was almost 275,000 in 2007 alone.
Migration Watch said the figures meant Labour let almost FOUR MILLION immigrants into Britain.
Chair Sir Andrew Green told the Sun: “They lost control of our borders."
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) were forced to admit they had only concentrated on arrivals to Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester airports.
But high numbers of immigrants flocked into the UK at regional airports as Ryanair and EasyJet spread across the Continent.
In 2007, the number of regional airports connecting to Poland and other eastern Europe countries after they joined the EU was 190 - six times higher than in 2001.
The ONS also dramatically under-estimated arrivals from outside the EU. Children aged under 15 were also regularly left out of the figures.
The shock figures came just hours after Labour revealed it would count every new arrival in and out of the UK.
Speaking during his trip to Israel, Labour leader Ed Miliband reiterated the party got it wrong on immigration.
Immigration minister James Brokenshire said the Government was committed to getting migration down.
He said: “Labour let immigration out of control for years, putting pressure on jobs, wages, and the local services people rely on.
“We have tightened up the immigration system and cut net immigration from outside the EU to its lowest level since 1998.
“Our long-term economic plan is reducing immigration so our economy delivers for people who work hard and play by the rules."
But Migration Watch said the ONS figures made the Government’s target of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands a year even harder to attain.
The ONS said it launched an investigation into its immigration figures after the 2011 Census showed the UK’s population was 464,000 higher than other estimates.
Stats chiefs yesterday said immigrants from the “EU8" that joined the EU on May 1 2004 flocked in via regional airports and low-cost airlines.
These countries were the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.
