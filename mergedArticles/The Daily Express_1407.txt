GRANT SHAPPS' assertion yesterday that the Government was still aiming to cut annual net immigration to "tens of thousands" is laughable because he and everyone else knows full well that as long as Britain is signed up to the EU's freedom of movement rules there is absolutely nothing we can do.
The Home Secretary Theresa May has publicly accepted as much and if other senior Government figures continue to indulge in fantasies rather than a few hard truths they will lose the trust of the voting public even more.
Ultimately, the only way in which we can properly regain control of our borders is to leave the EU. However, there is a great deal more that we can do before then and that includes a fundamental reform of our benefits system which, despite recent tinkering, remains far too generous for people who have never lived here and never contributed to its upkeep.
As it is, Britain remains a soft touch, a target for the unscrupulous, rewarding the unworthy while our society continues to fall apart.
It is the clear will of the British people – and that includes recently settled newcomers to our shores – that immigration should be brought under control.
When will the lofty political class, clearly hoping that their empty promises will silence us, finally recognise that?
