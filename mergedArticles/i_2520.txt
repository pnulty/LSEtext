An unpublished government-wide review has rebuffed repeated claims by Theresa May, the Home Secretary, that immigration has consigned large numbers of British workers to the dole queue.
The potentially explosive report concludes that there is "very little evidence" of such job displacement when the economy is growing. One Whitehall source told i the review found that the impact of immigration on British workers is "negligible."
The overview of all previous research on the highly sensitive issue since 2003 was conducted jointly by the Home Office, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and Department of Work and Pensions.
It will refute the statistic cited by Mrs May from a 2012 study by the Government's Migration Advisory Committee, which showed that "for every additional 100 immigrants... 23 British workers would not be employed". Whitehall insiders claimed that Mrs May had been advised by her officials not to rely on the statistic because it was not robust enough. One source said the Home Office now looked "pretty isolated", with other departments including the Treasury and Foreign Office also sceptical that immigration costs jobs.
In his first speech as Immigration Minister, James Brokenshire will say: "In the past year net migration from the EU has doubled and this figure is just too high. Some have tried to claim this rapid increase is somehow 'good' for the country. Well, just like the Home Secretary, I disagree."
The latest review of the impact of immigration will now be published shortly, after Labour accused Downing Street of supressing it to spare Mrs May's blushes.
