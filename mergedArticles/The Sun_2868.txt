CHANCELLOR George Osborne's father-in-law has branded the Government's immigration policies NASTY. Tory peer Lord Howell — dubbed Lord Howler — said it was clobbering trade and tourism. Revealing a Lords Committee report into how Britain can up its image, he said immigration rules blocked skilled workers and talented students. He blasted: "We're not getting it right."
And he added that the policies were creating "a nasty Britain feeling". Lord Howell was dubbed Lord Howler last summer when he said fracking sites should be in the North East — because it is "desolate". No 10's official spokeswoman said Government priority was to have a "controlled immigration system that allows the best and brightest" to enter the UK.
