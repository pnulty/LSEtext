WORKERS would be stripped of their basic rights to make life easier for unscrupulous bosses under plans previously revealed by UKIP.
On EMPLOYMENT the party would abolish maternity leave, holiday pay, sick pay and even redundancy pay, say Labour and the unions.
That would lead to even more foreigners being employed, said Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Michael Dugher. He warned: "UKIP want to remove protection at work to make it easier for unscrupulous bosses to hire cheaper migrant labour." GMB boss Paul Kenny said the party would take working people back to the "dark ages" with the ideas in its Small Business Manifesto.
On the NHS, the party would let GPs "charge a flat fee", according to one of its senior figures.
For BANKERS, UKIP has hinted at even higher bonuses. In response to the storm over their pay and perks, former City trader Mr Farage said: "We don't need official caps or limits." On the ECONOMY, UKIP would make huge cuts on top of the Coalition's austerity laws. The party has said it wants big cuts to FOREIGN AID while the HS2 high-speed rail link, GREEN TAXES and WIND TURBINES would all be scrapped.
However, UKIP insisted many "older" policies had been axed. A spokesman said: "We will be publishing a new manifesto."
For this week's Euro elections, the party promises a referendum on quitting THE EU and a ban on IMMIGRANTS claiming benefits or using the NHS or state schools for five years.
