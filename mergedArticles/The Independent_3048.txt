The "British builder" portrayed in a Ukip poster that accuses EU workers of taking UK jobs is actually an Irish actor who migrated to this country, it emerged yesterday.
In the latest embarrassment for Nigel Farage's chaotic European and local election campaign, the man - pictured begging on the street - has been identified as Dave O'Rourke, an actor from Dublin "looking to build" his portfolio.
He was pictured under the headline "EU Policy At Work" and the caption: "British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour."
Just last week Mr Farage stated that the party did not use actors in its adverts as it had enough "sincere" supporters not to need to. The gaffe emerged just hours after the party suspended a real Ukip supporter for a series of tweets which condemned Islam as evil.
However Ukip has defended a senior party official, David Challice, who placed an advert in a local paper in Exeter saying women should stay at home, "cash-strapped Muslims" should have multiple wives, and Greeks are "vile".
