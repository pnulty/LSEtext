Yesterday's employment figures reminded us that, when it comes to the immigration debate, we need to stick to the facts. Remember the beginning of the year? The endless predictions from Ukip and others that, as transitional controls on Bulgarians and Romanians entering the UK expired, we would find ourselves overrun, with British workers paying the price? Nigel Farage's party even issued a leaflet claiming that we were opening our doors to 29 million Romanians and Bulgarians. That would be quite something. The combined population of these countries is actually 28.6 million.
In reality, there has been no such surge. On the contrary, there has been a modest drop. And the real story told by yesterday's numbers is that a record number of people are now in work in the UK and, crucially, youth unemployment is coming down. This is extremely welcome news. Youth unemployment has been a problem since well before the crisis in our banks. Between Tony Blair entering Downing Street and Gordon Brown leaving it, the number of young people out of work rocketed from 650,000 to 930,000.
The numbers are, of course, still too high. Any young person having their hopes thwarted by a lack of opportunities is, in my view, a young person too many.
What matters is that we keep our foot on the pedal: youth unemployment won't come down on its own. We must actively create the opportunities for them to seize.
This has been a priority for me in this Parliament. After yesterday's good news I am even more determined to make it a priority in the next.
