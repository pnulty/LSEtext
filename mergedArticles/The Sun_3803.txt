FOR many people, immigration isn't just a theoretical argument between politicians.
For some towns and cities across the UK an influx of immigrants has changed their complexion completely — without anyone being consulted.
Not a single voter has ever been asked to approve our open door policy towards Eastern Europe.
No wonder Ukip is now doing so well.
All the old parties have to say is they understand voters' concerns.
Ukip offers the one thing that can guarantee to close the open door — quitting the EU.
It's not racist for people to be disconcerted by the pace of change to the population.
So it's important that it's not left to extremist fringe parties to talk about immigration.
Which is why it's worrying that so many Ukip candidates are now being revealed as holding distinctly unsavoury views.
Add to that the similarities between Ukip and BNP posters and it looks as if Ukip isn't quite as much of an alternative to extremism as it seems.
It's damaging to Ukip and worrying for the rest of us.
Because we need to be able to discuss immigration without sinking into racism and extremism.
