HOME Secretary Theresa May yesterday reiterated her warning that Scotland would lose UK intelligence services if it votes for independence.
Ms May said that a fledgling Scottish state would be vulnerable to terrorists, and that Alex Salmond's open-door immigration policy would result in border checkpoints.
At the Conservative Party Conference in Edinburgh yesterday, the Home Secretary said that, although the security services would continue to work with Police Scotland, the force would "lose its automatic access to MI5, MI6, GCHQ and the UK's wider intelligence capabilities".
She added border controls are a serious prospect, due to the First Minister's "looser immigration policy".
Ms May added: "The continuing UK could not allow Scotland to become a convenient landing point for migration. So that would mean border controls with passport checks. A literal and figurative barrier between our nations."
Earlier this week, Sir David Omand, the former GCHQ director, said the SNP's White Paper contained "optimistic assertions" that would leave a breakaway country at a greater risk.
And think tank the Royal United Services Institute described Scottish intelligence plans as "a hollow initiative designed to reinforce the perception that Scotland is safe."
The Scottish Government has insisted that "an independent state will have first-class security and intelligence services".
