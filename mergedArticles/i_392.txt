Nigel Farage will never know if Newark was set to join the ranks of great by-election upsets. But if the mood in the town's Market Place yesterday was anything to go by, his decision not to contest the vacant seat could go down as one of missed opportunity rather than inspired tactical retreat.
Michael Thorne, a butcher, said he became a fan of Mr Farage after spending 15 minutes in the Ukip leader's company at a market day. "He is a down-to-earth bloke and he doesn't beat around the bush. It's about time we had someone like that," said the 48-year-old. "It's about British people for British jobs. We need to support as many local people as we can."
One of his customers, Terence Dilger, 65, was less equivocal. "I think he is right on immigration - it is as simple as that," he said. "When I first came to Newark it was an ordinary town. Now it is a league of nations. You feel like a stranger in your own town. Even if he didn't win he would have got his message across."
