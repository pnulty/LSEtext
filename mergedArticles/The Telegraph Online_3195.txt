Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper sets out "progressive" Labour policy proposals to deliver an immigration system that works for all
Employers behind "wholesale" exploitation of illegal immigrant workers would face automatic jail terms under a Labour government, the shadow home secretary has said.
In a speech outlining Labour's approach to immigration, Yvette Cooper called for minimum jail terms for sweatshop owners and gangmasters and unveiled plans for a consultation on revising the existing criminal offence of forced labour to increase prosecutions.
Current law on forced labour requires an element of coercion or deception between the defendant and the victim, such as poor accommodation provided by the employer.
