DETECTIVES investigating suspicious activity near to a nursery in Erdington have arrested a man on suspicion of abduction, immigration offences and assault.
Officers have been investigating reports of suspicious activity near to Osbourne Nursery School since March 5. Police had received calls from worried parents from the Station Road school complaining about a man who had approached them on their way to nursery.
A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: "Each time a man had tried to engage people in conversation and on one occasion a woman reported that a man had tried to separate her from her child."
Detectives had a call on Wednesday that a man matching the description of the suspect was seen nearby on Jarvis Road.
"They were immediately dispatched to the scene and a man, aged 28, from Small Heath was arrested on suspicion of assault, abduction and immigration offences."
