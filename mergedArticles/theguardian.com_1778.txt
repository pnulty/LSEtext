Police say victims suffered bruising and cuts and one man lost two teeth in attack by gang of up to 15 people
Two men and a woman were beaten by a gang of up to 15 people in a racist attack in east Belfast, police said.
The victims suffered bruising and cuts and one of the men lost two teeth in the incident in the Lawnmount Street area of the city on Monday night.
The Alliance party councillor Maire Hendron said: "This was a shocking attack. There is no place for any type of hate crime in our society. We must challenge the views of those responsible. We must send out a clear message that their actions are completely unacceptable."
East Belfast has been a hotspot of racial violence this year with several attacks on the homes of African and Polish immigrants.
