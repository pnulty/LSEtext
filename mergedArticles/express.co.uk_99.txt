UKIP's Nigel Farage tonight took on Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in a debate over Britain's relationship with the EU.
The two party leaders went head-to-head on issues such as trade, immigration and criminal justice.
With the European elections looming on May 22 this year, both politicians were keen to win over new sections of the British electorate.
Mr Farage called for a "fresh approach" towards Europe, later suggesting "the best people to govern Britain are the British themselves."
Mr Clegg called on Britain to avoid becoming a "closed and narrow" country, having previously claimed leaving the European Union would jeopardise the "hard-won economic recovery".
