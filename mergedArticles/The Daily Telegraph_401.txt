THERESA MAY has defended James Brokenshire, her immigration minister, following his criticism of a "wealthy metropolitan elite" who use immigrants to provide "cheap labour".
Mr Brokenshire was accused in the House of Commons yesterday of relying on stereotypes and cliches. His comments last week led to questions being raised about Cabinet members' use of foreign domestic help, including David Cameron, much to the frustration of the Prime Minister's advisers.
Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, asked the Home Secretary if she would return Mr Brokenshire to his "normal sensible demeanour" to ensure a "constructive debate on immigration".
Mrs May replied: "A constructive debate on immigration was exactly what [Mr Brokenshire] was contributing to.
"And I do not accept the description of the speech that [Mr Brokenshire] has given. As I have just said … what he was pointing out is that uncontrolled immigration has the greatest impact on those at the lower end of the income scale.
"I would have thought as a Labour MP, you should care about that."
Separately a former Tory Coalition minister said British workers had been replaced by migrants in food and farming jobs because they are not willing to take on such work. Sir Jim Paice, an environment minister until 2012, said the only reason there was job displacement in the sector was because "British workers are just not prepared to do that work". ÞThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have hired a Spanish nanny for Prince George, it has been reported. One of the Duchess's friends told Hello! magazine that the unmarried childminder, in her thirties, has previously worked for other "prominent high-society families".
