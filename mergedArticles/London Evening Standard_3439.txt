NIGEL Farage has appeared on Question Time so often (11 times since May 2010) that there's a website called "isnigelfarageonquestiontime.com". But it isn't just QT: the Ukip leader is ubiquitous. So much so, that I've come to the only logical conclusion: there's more than one of him. In a factory somewhere they're churning out Farage-clones â€” boozing, bombastic bots with foghorns for voice boxes.
Perhaps we shouldn't worry about immigrants then, but the imminent arrival of automaton overlords to steal our jobs.
