By TOM NEWTON DUNN A MULTI-millionaire has spent £1.5million to fund a controversial Ukip poster campaign attacking immigration.
Hundreds of billboards — paid for by internet tycoon Paul Sykes — will accuse EU migrants of taking our jobs.
It is part of Ukip's campaign for the euro elections on May 22.
Labour MP Mike Gapes said the posters were "racist". But Ukip boss Nigel Farage said: "Are we going to ruffle a few feathers? Yes. Are we bothered about that? Not in the slightest."
