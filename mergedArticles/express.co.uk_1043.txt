FEW people are better qualified to speak on immigration than Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, the son of a Pakistani bus driver.
Sajid Javid said that immigrants must make an effort to integrate[PA]
His background makes his views all the more important because free from any possible accusation of racism he can speak his mind.
“Immigrants need to respect our way of life,” he says.
That means making a real effort to integrate, mixing socially and culturally – and most of all learning to speak English.
Mr Javid’s parents were very proud to be part of Britain so he is shocked when he meets immigrants who have been here 50 years and still haven’t learned English.
Mr Javid’s promotion to high office demonstrates it’s not who you are or where you come from that matters any more – it’s what you are able to contribute to society.
Too many immigrants don’t take responsibility for adapting to our ways and by failing to learn how to communicate they perpetuate the us-and-them divide.
Those Muslims who demand that sharia law not British law should be supreme also obstruct the cause of integration.
We applaud Mr Javid’s declaration that there is no place for sharia law in Britain.
It’s too late to turn back the immigration clock.
What we can do however is encourage every new citizen to become more British.
Mr Javid is the perfect example for them to follow.

Ease this arthritis agony
TEN million people will wake up today and feel agony in their joints – what a disturbing report describes as “a tsunami of pain”.
Tragically despite the best efforts of medical research there is a lack of effective treatment and the charity Arthritis Care warns that the toll arthritis is taking on the nation is unsustainable.
The one glimmer of hope is that over-the-counter pills and gels can bring relief and yet the report reveals that barely one person in three receives proper advice about what they can do to help themselves.
This is a scandalous situation that the Health Secretary must put right.
It won’t take a lot of money to give people the support that can make their lives more bearable, just some determined action.
What are we waiting for?

Beautiful bees get buzzy
OF ALL god’s creatures the bee is probably the hardest working and the one we need the most.
Pollinating crops provides our food so we are thrilled that 40 queen bumblebees are being let into the wild today.
Let’s hope they get a real buzz out of their work.
