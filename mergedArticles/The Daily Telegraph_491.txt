IMMIGRANTS have cost the taxpayer more than £22million a day since the mid–1990s, a report claims.
MigrationWatch UK, which campaigns against mass immigration, added that in 2011 the costs were equivalent to £3,000 a day for each of the eight million foreign–born people living in Britain.
It compiled the figures in response to a study published by University College London (UCL) last year which claimed immigrants made a "substantial" contribution to public finances. The pressure group's new report said UCL's conclusions – which were given prominent coverage by the BBC – were "simply wrong".
In fact, immigration between 1995 and 2011 cost the taxpayer more than £140 billion, or £22 million a day, after balancing what immigrants pay in tax with what they take out of Britain's funds by claiming benefits and tax credits, it said.
In 2011 alone the cost was £23 billion, or £3,000 each for the eight million foreign–born population, the group said, a sum equal to the amount spent by the NHS on GPs and dentists in a year.
Sir Andrew Green, the chairman of MigrationWatch UK, said: "Our report finally disposes of the immigration lobby's oft–repeated claims that immigration reduces our tax burden. The total cost is high and increased dramatically between 1995 and 2011, providing no compensation for the overcrowding of this island."
