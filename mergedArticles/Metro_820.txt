DESERT ISLAND DISCS: STUART HALL www.bbc.co.uk Cultural theorist Stuart Hall died earlier this month and revisiting his Desert Island Discs from 2000 makes for remarkable listening. It's an accessible route into his groundbreaking ideas around race, identity and Britishness, and it's eerie how much of what he says chimes with the rhetoric around immigration and Scottish independence. Along the way Hall recounts growing up in Jamaica, how he became 'West Indian' while studying at Oxford University and enjoys music from Billie Holiday, Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye to Miles Davis, Bach and Puccini's Madame Butterfly.
THE VIEW FROM 22 blogs.spectator.co.uk/the-view-from-22/Last week's Spectator podcast featured journalist and transgender activist Paris Lees and writer Julie Burchill discussing feminism and 'intersectionality' - a theory recognising multiple strands of prejudice, such as sexism and racism and how they interlock. Burchill (right) feels it has undermined the solidarity of feminism while Lees highlights its importance in understanding the discrimination marginalised groups face. A bitter, personal row ensues. Neither comes out of it well, though The Spectator is laughing all the way to the top of the podcast charts.
NPR: TECH TALK www.npr.org The latest in NPR's Tech Talk explores dating and love in the digital age. Instantaneous apps such as Tinder and Grindr, and whether they remove the build-up to relationships, are discussed as well as the impact of always having a wealth of better options. The discussion moves on to whether it's possible to 'fall for Siri', and with Spike Jonze's new film, Her, exploring this very theme, it's not as fanciful as it sounds.
