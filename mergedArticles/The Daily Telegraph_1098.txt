The Afghan immigrant whose attempt to get across the Channel on a makeshift raft was thwarted by the winds, tides and currents is safely back on dry land – for now. The 23–year–old was picked up by a lifeboat a mile off the French coast in his Robinson Crusoe–style craft made out of a table leg and wooden planks, with a bed sheet for a sail. For comfort and buoyancy, he added a float wrapped in a tarpaulin on which he sat, just inches above the sea, whose temperature is a bone–chilling 10C at this time of the year. Such apparent foolhardiness has led many to denounce his idiocy and sympathise with his desperation. Yet he is also worthy of praise for having the nerve to set out in such a ramshackle boat. Our immigration laws do not offer access to the country for gumption and courage. If they did, this young man would be at the head of the queue.
