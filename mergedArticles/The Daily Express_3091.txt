A STAR of the UK Independence Party's latest election broadcast was suspended last night for expressing "repellent" opinions.
Decorator and kitchen fitter Andre Lampitt raised concerns about immigration from Eastern Europe in the TV ad for the party's Euro election campaign.
But it emerged yesterday that he had previously posted shocking messages on the internet, including a suggestion that Africans should "kill themselves off".
He also said Labour leader Ed Miliband was "not British" and that Islam was "evil.
Repellent After the Twitter messages came to light, Ukip officials said Mr Lampitt's party membership was being suspended. "We are deeply shocked that Mr Lampitt has expressed such repellent views," a Ukip spokesman said.
Mr Lampitt, who has described himself as "born British in Rhodesia" was filmed on a building site for the Ukip ad.
In the clip, he complained that EU migrants were undercutting the wages of native workers.
