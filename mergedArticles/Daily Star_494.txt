Says..
IMMIGRATION has cost British taxpayers Â£140billion since 1995.
That is shocking. Campaigners revealed the eyewatering figure yesterday. It proves our borders are totally out of control.
And we Brits are suffering massively as a result.
Our public services are creaking under the influx.
Hospitals can't cope and schools are full to bursting thanks to a foreign baby boom.
This cannot go on. Britain is full.
It's time for politicians to stop dancing around the subject.
Finally act.
And close the doors to new arrivals.
