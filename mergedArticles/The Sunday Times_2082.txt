"Racist" is the first word that most commonly comes to Scots' minds when they think of UKIP, a poll found.
The Panelbase survey, for The Sunday Times and commercial radio station Heart ahead of this week's European elections, found that 12% thought first of the term, ahead of 9% who thought of the name of the party's leader Nigel Farage.
UKIP has no elected politician in Scotland but hopes to win one seat on Thursday, gained at the expense of Lib Dem MEP George Lyon, whose party's popularity keeps waning.
The next most common words people associate with UKIP are independence (3%), immigration (3%), idiots (3%), bigoted (2%), British (1%), Europe (1%) and fascists (1%). About 59% opted for various other terms and 5% did not know.
UKIP denied the party is racist. "We know that we're not, but the constant daily media barrage and from all our opponents is having an impact," a spokesman said.
The Scottish sample in the latest YouGov poll for The Sunday Times suggests UKIP may have half as much support north of the border as at a UK level — 7% against 13% — similar to the Lib Dems on 5%.
UKIP believes that it has "a fighting chance" of winning a Scottish seat.
"If we do it presents a huge problem for Alex Salmond because the message from the SNP has been that there aren't people like that in Scotland. Well, yes there are. Even if we don't get someone elected in Scotland we will be within spitting distance," said the spokesman.
