David Cameron is set to come under Tory pressure to remove jobless EU migrants after Germany indicated plans to adopt the measure.
A number of Conservative MPs told The Times that draft proposals from a German government panel, stating that EU migrants would be expelled if they failed to find work within three months, should be adopted in Britain.
Nigel Mills, the Tory MP who led a rebellion over immigration, said yesterday that removing unemployed migrants was a sensible step forward.
"We have not gone as far as saying we will send people home if they have not found work. Even free movement to come and work should not be unrestricted, but this sounds like a very sensible proposal," he said.
