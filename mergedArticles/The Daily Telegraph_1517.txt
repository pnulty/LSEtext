THE WEEK'S BEST FILMS
Ride the High Country (1962)
CHANNEL 4, 12.50PM ***
The film that put Hollywood maverick Sam Peckinpah on the map. Only his second feature, it re–examined the classic western, depicting the final adventure of two ageing gunfighters (Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott) among the dying embers of the frontier age. The action is underpinned by the men's nostalgic reminiscences and regretful ruminations. A masterclass in unobtrusive filmmaking.
This Is the End (2013)
SKY MOVIES PREMIERE, 8.00PM ***
Seth Rogan's latest wheeze is a stoner comedy set during the Apocalypse, which strikes during a party at James Franco's Hollywood mansion. Franco appears in the film as himself, as do the comedians Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson and Jay Baruchel, all of whom are left behind when the righteous are raptured up to heaven. Rogen's comedy hardly breaks new ground, but why change a winning formula?
Gangs of New York (2002)
SKY MOVIES GREATS, 9.35PM ****
Martin Scorsese's 19th–century epic tempted Method master Daniel Day–Lewis out of retirement and introduced Leonardo DiCaprio as the new post–De Niro fixture in his films. He plays the son who returns to New York to avenge the death of his Irish immigrant father at the hands of Day–Lewis's Bill the Butcher, only to be sucked into the city's gang culture.
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006)
CHANNEL 5, 11.00PM ***
Will Ferrell fans will need little encouragement to lap up this affectionate send–up of Nascar racing, redneck culture and male bonding. Ferrell pays a Nascar speed–demon who is challenged by a gay, French Formula One driver (Sacha Baron Cohen), to see who is the ultimate racer. It's a full throttle comedy that plays to Ferrell's strengths.
An Officer and a Gentleman (1982)
FILM4, 11.10PM ***
Richard Gere sent millions of hearts afluttering in this romantic drama. He plays a loner who trains as a naval aviator and swoops into the town that's home to the training school to break the hearts of the local women. But one, played by Debra Winger, catches his eye more than most. Soppy but enthralling all the same.
