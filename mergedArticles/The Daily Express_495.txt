THE Daily Express has long warned that a failure to clamp down on immigration would have a devastating impact on Britain's economy and culture.
It has been revealed that between 1995 and 2011 immigration cost us a staggering £148billion which equates to £5,600 per household.
Such an amount of money would be heartily welcomed by the British people who are sick and tired of working hard to get ahead while immigrants pick up jobs and benefits.
The figures unequivocally show that the Left's claim that immigration benefits this country is simply untrue.
Uncontrolled immigration from the EU and a failure adequately to regulate immigration from the rest of the world has caused far more harm than good.
Net migration to the UK was up 30 per cent this year with the number of immigrants rising above half a million. This is far more people than the UK can accommodate and a clear recipe for disaster.
A series of weak and misguided immigration policies costing us billions of pounds is outright scandalous and the politicians must recognise that they have to listen to the people.
We have had enough of soaring immigration. It is damaging our public services, it is eroding our sense of community and it has left us billions of pounds out of pocket.
It has to be stopped before it costs us even more.
