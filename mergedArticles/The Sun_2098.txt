MORE than 130 athletes, coaches and officials at the London Olympics have refused to leave Britain.
A total of 82 people have claimed asylum while 50 others have been allowed to stay.
But the Home Office figures only tracked those involved with the Games and not the spectators — meaning the numbers could be far higher.
Tory MP Philip Davies, who uncovered the figures, said: "We are a soft touch. It's meant to be a sporting event, not an immigration event."
The majority of the Olympic asylum seekers are Africans fleeing persecution. The Home Office said all visa applications are considered on merit.
