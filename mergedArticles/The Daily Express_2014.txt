CRIMINALS in Scotland have been stripped of assets totalling £8million as part of a campaign to smash their illicit money-making schemes.
Drug dealers, loan sharks, fraudsters and people traffickers were among the targets who had money and property seized over the past year.
Crown Office officials said they had "ramped up" their use of confiscation orders using a team of experts composed of former police and tax investigators and had served a total of 280 civil recovery notices since April last year. The six orders made per week last year is up on the 195 made during 2012-13.
Solicitor General Lesley Thomson said that the orders, made under the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) are aimed at disrupting criminal empires.
Figures revealed by the Crown Office yesterday revealed that £3.6million was recovered through criminal courts and £4.4million via civil courts.
One criminal, Kwai Fun Li, lost cash and property worth a total of £722,956 last year after a series of seizures.
Her criminality had involved using illegal immigrants to staff Chinese buffet restaurants in Glasgow and Bishopbriggs.
An order was made at the High Court in Livingston in March against heroin dealer Mohammed Riaz, 42, and £203,724 wasseized.
A seizure of £45,000 was made against Thomas Reid in February for running an illegal money lending business in Lanarkshire.
In the first seizure under animal welfare laws, Charles Swan had £12,340 taken in relation to the conditions at a puppy farm he was operating at Airth, near Falkirk.
Investigators are also working abroad and a row of houses in Spain is to be the target of an order.
Ms Thomson said: "POCA has resulted in serious disruption to criminals in Scotland.
"Those who attempt to build up criminal business are finding we can wreck their ventures by ending their funding streams and hopes of living off the profits of their crimes."
