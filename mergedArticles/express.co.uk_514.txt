IAIN Duncan Smith’s measures to stop immigrants from claiming benefits until they have been in the country and earning at least £150 a week for three months come into force this month.
It has also been confirmed that child benefit and child tax credit will be subject to the same three-month rule. This represents progress but it also shows how limited Government’s powers really are. 
He also said that he wants to do even more to prevent immigrants living off handouts from our Government by stopping them claiming benefits until they have been in this country for a year “no matter what the European Commission tries to tell us”.
The Daily Express absolutely agrees with the sentiment but the chances of the Work and Pensions Secretary’s grand rhetoric about defying Brussels actually leading to serious changes have to be regarded as close to zero. 
Ultimately while Britain remains an EU member we are still subject to European diktats no matter how much Iain Duncan Smith – and the majority of the British public – may dislike the fact. We still have no power to prevent EU citizens from entering the country and no power to implement the extended benefit proposals that Mr Duncan Smith has put forward. Or at least we don’t until we leave the EU.

Maria Miller must go now
The scandal of Maria Miller’s expenses is threatening to do serious damage to the Tories’ reputation as a party and David Cameron’s reputation as a leader. A poll by ComRes has found that 74 per cent of people believe she should have been sacked for over-claiming expenses while 69 per cent of Conservative Party supporters think she needs to go. 
Even the Culture Secretary’s colleagues on the Tory benches are turning against her in ever greater numbers as they begin to finally comprehend the depth of the public’s outrage and the scale of the damage being done to their party. 
Her stubborn attempts to stay on the front benches threaten to undermine the good work done by the Tories during the last four years. This will be of huge concern to those within the party and its supporters. Mrs Miller has to go and the sooner the better.

Get a slow boat to China
Benefit cheat Dawn Pinchen, who claimed she could not walk the length of a car, has been caught visiting the Great Wall of China after posting her holiday snaps online. Members of the public would probably be in favour of criminals such as Pinchen heading off to far-flung corners of the world – provided they do not come back of course.
