IN BRIEF
BRITAIN: Ten Foreign National Offenders (FNOs) have served more than half a decade in prison beyond the end of their sentence, according to Home Office figures.
Approximately 850 FNOs have spent from up to one month to more than 60 months in jail awaiting deportation following the end of their term, data showed.
Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: "We make every effort to ensure that a person's removal by deportation coincides, as far as possible."
