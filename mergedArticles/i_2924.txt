An A-level student continued to be held at the immigration centre last night after her deportation to Mauritius was delayed.
A spokesperson for Yashika Bageerathi's school in Enfield, north London, said Mauritius Air had refused to take her. Lawyers for the 19-year-old will make a bid to prevent her deportation today.
She has said that she "hates" being held in the centre.
