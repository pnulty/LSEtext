News | The Opinion Matrix COMMENT FROM HOME & ABROAD UKIP SCRUTINISED
Daily Mail Like it or not, the beerswigging, cigarettepuffing Ukip leader is currently being exposed to public scrutiny as never before. Just weeks before May's European elections, the main political parties are terrified that he will cause an electoral earthquake by exploiting widespread public unhappiness about the EU and the effects of out-of-control immigration policies. After this week's allegations that he used taxpayers' money to employ his wife and exmistress, one wonders how much longer Nigel Farage will be able safely to walk that tightrope. (Andrew Pierce)
