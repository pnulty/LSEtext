EXCLUSIVE
NICK Clegg has slammed the PM's bid to reform Britain's relationship with the EU — saying it is doomed to failure.
In an exclusive interview, the Lib Dem leader said David Cameron's "small fry" reform proposals were so insignificant that even HE would back them.
And he said they would never be enough to satisfy Tory backbenchers baying for Britain to quit the European Union altogether.
The Europhile Deputy PM told Sun cabbie Grant Davis: "He has told the public what he is going to renegotiate. And it is small fry. "If you look at the shopping list of things David Cameron is actually talking about, most of it I could agree with.
"A lot of it is perfectly sensible but it is not going to satisfy those people who want a complete redrawing of the map."
Incredibly, Mr Clegg insisted it was the Lib Dems who were forcing the PM and Theresa May to get tough on immigration by introducing exit checks at the border.
His comments come days before Thursday's European elections, where Mr Clegg and the Lib Dems are expected to face a bloodbath — and risk reigniting the bitter war of words in the Coalition.
The Sun wants the PM to make immigration a "red line" issue in renegotiation talks. He laid out seven major changes he wanted in March.
But Gunther Krichbaum, a German minister for the EU, accused him of desperately trying to appease Ukip".
