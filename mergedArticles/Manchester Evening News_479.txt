Man appears in court after sniffer dogs find drugs in bag following Dubai flight. .
AMAN has appeared in court charged with drug smuggling after opium was found in jars of hair product at Manchester Airport.
Amir Rahnama, 43, was arrested after Border Force officers searched baggage that had arrived on a flight from Dubai on Saturday.
Mr Rahnama, an Iranian national, appeared at Trafford magistrates court on Monday charged with the importation of a Class A drug. He entered no plea and was remanded in custody to appear at Minshull Street Crown Court on March 31.
Border Force officers carried out a search using sniffer dogs.
They say a dog indicated a bag and when officers searched it, they discovered it contained several jars of hair product that tested positive for opium.
Tests are still being carried out on the drugs seized.
Phil Shields, assistant director for Border Force, said: "This seizure shows how valuable detector dogs can be in the fight against harmful drugs. I would also like to pay tribute to the vigilance and hard work of the officers involved."
Border Force is the law enforcement body responsible for protecting the UK border. Its responsibilities include immigration and security checks, prevention of people trafficking, and the smuggling of banned and restricted goods, including drugs and weapons and protection of border revenue.
