A paper being put before the party’s conference in York says they deserve a “more humane subsistence".
It also calls on Britain to stop detaining asylum seekers - and manage them in a “community-based" system similar to Sweden.
The Lib Dems are dropping their 2010 pledge for an “amnesty" on illegal immigrants, which would have allowed anyone in Britain for longer than a decade to stay.
But furious Tory backbenchers yesterday said the asylum proposals were “astonishing".
Henry Smith, Tory MP for Crawley said: “The Conservatives are fixing Britain’s benefits system to make work pay.
“But the Lib Dems are now proposing 'uprating' benefits for asylum seekers.
“This proposal alongside their plan to stop detaining even those asylum seekers who are likely to abscond show the Lib Dems are as out of touch as Labour with the concerns of hard-working people."
