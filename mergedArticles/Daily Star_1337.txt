UKIP leader Nigel Farage blasted Britain yesterday saying it was "unfit to pass to our children".
He claimed the UK had lost control of its borders in an attack on the Westminster Coalition's open-door immigration policy.
Farage, 49, also berated the Government for its response to the flood crisis.
He called for a public inquiry to review the Environment Agency, which he slammed for favouring "molluscs and beetles" over "farmers and householders".
In a speech ahead of the European elections on May 22, Farage said: "Together we can get our country back."
