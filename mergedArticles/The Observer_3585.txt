The wider demonisation of Romanian immigrants to the UK has fuelled longstanding negative attitudes to the Roma, in particular, as work-shy thieves and troublemakers. Most seem to assume the two are one and the same, though Roma make up under 5 per cent of Romanians. Stories last year about Roma "stealing" babies in Greece and Ireland proved groundless, but our ready acceptance of them revealed how deep-rooted are the myths we have all inherited.
Yaron Matras has spent many years getting to know inward-looking Roma communities across Europe, unravelling their history, language and customs from origins in India. It is an ancient and rich culture he describes, passed on largely through the oral tradition, hence some of the confusion (for example, Matras shows how most Roma prefer to stay in one place, not roam). But it is also a history of scapegoating and marginalisation of a people considered "other".
The parallels with the treatment of the Jews are clear, but whereas the Holocaust shocked Europe into examining its conscience on anti-Semitism, even the murder of between 100,000 and 1.5 million Roma by the Nazis (depending on which estimate you take) has done little to exorcise our prejudices. Matras's immaculately researched study is a challenge belatedly to make a start. Peter Stanford
