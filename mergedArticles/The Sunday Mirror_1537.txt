Here's a story of two "immigrants." First Ugandan Ruth Nabuguzi, who's been in Britain for 20 years and was sentenced to six years jail in November 2012 for her part in a £4million benefits fraud.
She was also involved in property scams and was told by a judge this week that unless she paid back £1.5m she would face another six years in jail before being sent home. Predictably she's now claiming asylum saying if she goes home she'll be killed by angry relatives.
This scuzz-bag also pretended she had Aids, got the drugs, and then sold them to REAL victims back in Uganda.
Cut to Ralph Marx, an American businessman who for 13 years has lived in West Sussex with his British wife Lorraine and their ten-year-old daughter. Ralph never applied for permanent residency because his job took him away so much that being here didn't affect his visa conditions.
Then he got cancer and within months not only was he billed for £98,000 for his NHS care ( he'd wanted to use his private insurance but was told that because his life was in danger he should opt for the NHS) He was then booted out of Britain for being "a burden on the state."
This is a man who has paid many thousands in taxes and is an asset to Britain - NOT a criminal. Yet still he's been forcibly separated from his family because our idiotic system panders to and favours lowlife scum like Ruth Nabuguzi and punishes people like him.
What's the betting that Nabuguzi will be allowed to stay here, but if Lorraine Marx ever wants to see her husband again she'll have to uproot herself and her daughter and go live in the States?
