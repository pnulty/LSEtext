Cardinal Vincent Nichols has warned that the debate about immigration shouldn't be "cushioned" in expressions which are "alarmist and evocative of anger or of dismay and distress at all these people coming to these country".
Cardinal Nichols, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, spoke exclusively to the Telegraph following visits to a refuge for asylum seekers in north London and a crisis centre in Folkestone alongside the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.
He appealed to politicans to ensure the debate about immigration is done with "a sense of realism and with a sense of respect".
Speaking about how refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Britain are treated, the Cardinal said: "I think it's very important that into our political debate goes a good dose of reality, and the reality is that people who are waiting to have a due process are treated in a way that leaves them very crippled.
"The vast majority of migrants to this country add to our wellbeing."
