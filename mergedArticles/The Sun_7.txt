BRITAIN'S £108million EuroMillions winner Neil Trotter was last night linked to race-hate messages online in which the far-right British National Party is praised.
Someone using the name "Chameleon" — the same name as a company linked to mechanic Neil — said BNP leader Nick Griffin's 2009 suggestion to sink boats carrying illegal immigrants from Africa was "spot on".
And responding to a post in which a Muslim was branded a "P***", the user called Chameleon wrote: "Vote BNP and get rid of this s***."
Almost 400 posts on PassionFord — a site for car enthusiasts — are attributed to a user called Chameleon with some signed off by someone using the name "Neil".
Dad-of-two Mr Trotter, 41, who runs Chameleon Coachworks in Mitcham, South London, won the £108million jackpot ten days ago.
Last night lottery operator Camelot confirmed Mr Trotter, of Coulsdon, is aware of the allegations. He declined to comment.
