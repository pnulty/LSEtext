VOTERS don't trust David Cameron to win a better EU deal for Britain, a poll reveals today. Three out of four have little faith in the PM clawing back power from Brussels — as they fear he lacks the negotiating clout, or that other member states will block him. The poll by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft is a blow to Mr Cameron's bid to win seven concessions in areas like red tape and immigration as the price for us staying in the EU.
It casts doubt on the idea that the offer of an in-out ballot on Europe in 2017 will be a vote winner at next year's General Election. Fixing the economy and jobs are seen as more important issues. The survey of 20,000 reveals barely one in five voters is confident the PM has what it takes to get us a better deal.
Two-thirds think other countries get more out of the EU than Britain.
About half think the cost of being a member outweighs the benefits.
One in five is undecided on whether we should stay in.
Top reasons for staying in were free trade, ease of travel, less likelihood of war and living and working abroad.
A No10 source said: "The PM has already proved he can get a better deal in Europe. "He vetoed a damaging EU treaty, pulled the UK out of a costly EU bank bailout and cut the Brussels budget for the first time in history."
