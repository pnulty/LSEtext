LABOUR'S Gloria De Piero has revealed she posed for topless pictures aged 15 because she saw modelling as a route out of poverty.
The Shadow Women's and Equalities Minister's family struggled after her Italian immigrant father was forced to give up work due to ill health when she was 10.
Speaking of her Bradford childhood Gloria, 41, told Red magazine: "Living on benefits is a miserable life.
"The giro came every two weeks - the first week was okay but the second wasn't - you got a bit hungry.
"It was the era of Page 3 - you know, Sam Fox, Linda Lusardi... All those women seemed to have a better life than me.
RELIEF "I remember Mum ringing the agency and trying to stop it from happening and me going mad. I thought it might be a route out."
To their relief, the topless pictures never emerged.
The rising Labour star and MP for Ashfield, Notts, is now tipped for a Cabinet job if Ed Miliband's party wins the next election.
But ex-GMTV star Gloria ruled herself out as a future PM, despite the clamour for Labour's next leader to be a woman. She says: "People think I'm ambitious but I'm just ambitious for my party."
Talking about not being a mum she added: "It wasn't a matter of 'I'm having a career, therefore I can't have children' - I've never had that compelling urge."
Full interview in April's Red, on sale March 4.
