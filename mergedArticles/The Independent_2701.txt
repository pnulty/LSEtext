The European Union: In or Out?
7pm BBC2
Ukip's Nigel Farage shaded last week's opening debate with the Lib Dem leader, Nick Clegg, by most accounts, with the topic of immigration creating the heat. David Dimbleby referees the second round.
Monkey Planet
9pm BBC1
Tarsiers literally have eyes bigger than their stomachs. These tiny gremlins from Asia are among the various primates explored by the zoologist Dr George McGavin (there's something of the David Attenborough about him as he stalks sotto voce about the undergrowth) in his new series about our closest cousins. The most magical scenes involve some orang-utans in Borneo, who, after watching the humans by the riverside, have started experimenting with washing themselves with soap.
Kim Philby - His Most Intimate Betrayal
9pm BBC2
A quarter of a century after his death, Kim Philby has become a caricature of a gentleman master spy, says Ben Macintyre (left), as he begins his two-part myth-busting exercise about the double agent. "The real Philby was charming but also a fanatic and ruthless killer."
W1A
10pm BBC2
After the inevitable initial disappointment (well, it was a follow-up the sublime Twenty Twelve), John Morton's satire of BBC management has bedded in nicely. Anna advocates moving Songs of Praise to radio to free up a slot for Britain's Tastiest Village, Ian's salary is attacked in the press and Siobhan is asked to redesign the BBC logo. Please, no.
