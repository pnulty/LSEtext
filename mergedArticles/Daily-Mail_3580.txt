* Shadow Floods Minister Barry Gardiner flew out to Mexico last week
* Red Ed's 'special envoy on climate change' basked in the sun as thousands of British families faced the impact of the devastating floods
* MP was guest of multi-millionaire pharmaceuticals boss, Labour supporter and friend of Mr Miliband, Bharat Shah
* Mr Gardiner and his wife Caroline enjoyed a stay at the Cancun's luxury Moon Palace Resort - and the bill came to £3,650
The senior MP in charge of Labour’s response to the floods crisis spent last week on an  all-expenses-paid junket to a luxury resort in sun-kissed Mexico.
As Britain struggled to recover from the devastating deluge, Shadow Floods Minister Barry Gardiner – who is also Ed Miliband’s ‘special envoy on climate change’ – jetted off to Cancun with his wife.
The £3,650 jolly was paid for by pharmaceuticals tycoon Bharat Shah, a multi-millionaire Labour supporter and friend of Mr Miliband.
Former Minister Mr Gardiner’s decision to go ahead with the free trip is all the more remarkable after Mr Miliband cancelled his own scheduled political trip to India, because of the floods in Britain.
Mr Gardiner is a contender for Parliament’s King Of The Junkets.
A Mail on Sunday investigation has established that since he was elected in 1997, the MP has spent an astonishing 157 days on all-expenses-paid foreign trips to exotic places in six  continents, at a cost of well over £100,000.
It is the equivalent of spending an entire Parliamentary year abroad.
Much of his globetrotting has been paid for by the climate change lobby group, Globe International, which is part-funded by British taxpayers.
Most of the trips enjoyed by Mr Gardiner, who was a Minister in Tony Blair’s Government, have come in the four years since Labour lost power.
Since 2010, when MPs were forced to declare the costs of such jaunts – officially called fact-finding trips – he has racked up 103 days overseas at a cost of £74,125. In 2011 alone, he spent 35 days abroad on free trips.
MILLIBAND'S MILLIONAIRE HOST
The man whose company has paid for Barry Gardiner’s stay in Cancun is Labour-supporting Anglo Indian multi-millionaire Bharat Shah, a friend and admirer of Ed Miliband.
Mr Shah’s family-run Sigma pharmaceutical giant has given nearly £8,000 to Labour. After David Cameron came to power, he claimed Tories raised the threat of ‘NHS privatisation’.
In November, Mr Shah sponsored an event at Labour’s London HQ to celebrate the  Diwali festival. Mr Miliband was guest of honour and Mr Gardiner attended. 
Mr Gardiner was also at the previous year’s Diwali event, again sponsored by Mr Shah, where Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was the main guest.
In 2005, Kenyan-born Mr Shah, 64, was among a number of top businessmen who wrote to the Financial Times urging people to vote for Tony Blair in thanks for ‘booming Britain’. 
The economy may have faltered since, but Watford-based Sigma has gone from strength to strength, turning over more than £200 million a year.
The company has given £1,420 to Labour’s central funds plus £6,500 to former Watford Labour MP and Minister Claire Ward. On losing her Commons seat 2010, she became chief executive of the Independent Pharmacy Federation lobby group. Sigma has funded the organisation and describes itself as ‘a long standing supporter’.
Mr Shah is a keen motorsports enthusiast who tries to attend three Grands Prix a year. He once said: ‘All the Formula 1 races take place in nice destinations. It’s quite nice to go to Rio, Abu Dhabi or Shanghai.’
The conference in Cancun was organised by the Sigma pharmaceuticals giant, run by respected Anglo-Indian businessman Mr Shah.
He was a cheerleader for Mr Blair, is a friend and admirer of Mr Miliband and his firm has given money to Labour coffers.
While politicians on all sides last week visited flood-hit towns and villages and discussed how to stop it happening again, 56-year-old Mr Gardiner left it all behind, flying 5,000 miles to the stretch of Mexico’s Caribbean coastknown as ‘the Mayan Riviera’.
The Brent North MP and his wife Caroline, a sculptor and poet, who is also paid £25,000 as her husband’s Commons ‘immigration adviser’, were ostensibly attending a pharmaceutical industry convention.
In exchange for giving just one hour-long speech on Tuesday, the couple got to stay in a lavish £325-a-night suite at the Sunrise Hotel within the Moon Palace resort.
The suite has a sunken two-person jacuzzi and views over a tropical garden.
But if Mr Gardiner had wanted to maintain a low profile as he lazed by the pool in 85F (29C) sunshine, his presence was revealed when some of the 460 other delegates at the Moon Palace tweeted about him.
On Friday, Mr Gardiner – in Hawaiian shirt and Panama hat – spent his last full day in Cancun swimming, eating and enjoying a romantic walk with his wife along the Caribbean beach.
Earlier in the week, the couple wore Indian-style clothing for a ‘Bollywood Night’ and on another evening Mr Gardiner donned a tuxedo for a black tie dinner in the ballroom.
Mr Gardiner is not breaking any Commons rules by taking the freebie, but asked why he had spent the week at the junket instead of advising Mr Miliband on the floods, the frontbencher said he had been invited to give a speech on waste.
Pressed to say if had considered cancelling the trip because of the floods, he said: ‘I’ve given my reply, thank you.’  
And asked to explain his connection to Sigma and the pharmacy world, he said: ‘I’ve just told you. I’m on parliamentary recess, OK?’
Mr Gardiner has shown no previous significant political interest in pharmaceuticals.
The Commons website lists his interests as ‘environment, climate change, economy, trade, education and foreign affairs’ – but no mention of pharmaceuticals.
As a leading light in Labour Friends of India, he does have links with Mr Bharat. In November, Mr Gardiner attended a Diwali celebration at Labour HQ sponsored by the tycoon. Mr Miliband was guest of honour.
Mr Miliband declined to comment last night.
