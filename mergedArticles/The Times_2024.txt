A candidate in the European elections has been arrested after making a speech quoting from a book by Winston Churchill about Islam.
Paul Weston, chairman of the Liberty GB party, was making the speech on the steps of Winchester Guildhall, Hampshire, on Saturday, when a member of the public complained to police and he was arrested. He had been reading from Churchill's The River War, written in 1899 while he was a British Army officer in Sudan.
The candidate in the South East England constituency for the European elections on May 22 was detained for failing to comply with a request by police to move on under the powers of a dispersal order made against him. He was also arrested on suspicion of religious or racial harassment and released on bail.
The Liberty GB mission statement reveals what the party believes to be the "most important issues of our time" — namely "mass immigration from the Third World, the steady rise of fundamentalist Islam and the hijacking of traditional British culture and institutions by well-organised left-wing progressives".
