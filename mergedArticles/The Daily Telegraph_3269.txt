A FLOOD of Bulgarian and Romanian migrants to Britain predicted by some politicians and campaigners has failed to materialise, according to figures released yesterday.
The number working here fell slightly in the first quarter of this year after employment restrictions were relaxed, although the total number of foreign workers jumped by nearly 100,000.
The Office for National Statistics said there were 140,000 migrants from Romania and Bulgaria working in Britain in January, February and March. That was down 4,000 from the end of 2013, but a 29,000 increase from a year earlier.
On Jan 1, Britain lifted restrictions on citizens of the two eastern European countries working here, a move that led to predictions of a large number of new arrivals. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, called it "irresponsible and wrong".
The Government repeatedly refused to estimate how many more immigrants would come after January, but MigrationWatch, a campaign group, predicted as many as 250,000 from the two countries.
Mark Harper, a former Conservative immigration minister, said Romanians and Bulgarians had stayed away because other EU countries also opened their labour markets to them, he added.
Mr Harper said Coalition reforms to welfare had also played a part, adding: "We've tightened up access to benefits and services to stop people abusing free movement."
Ion Jinga, the Romanian ambassador to the UK, suggested that his countrymen preferred other western European nation such as Spain, Italy, France or Germany.
European Commission figures show that even before restrictions were lifted, there were far more Romanians and Bulgarians in other western European countries. Last year, there were around a million in Spain, 900,000 in Italy and more than 250,000 in Germany.
The latest UK figures led for calls for Ukip to apologise, but Mr Farage continued to attack the Government's wider immigration policy. "Far from controlling immigration, this Government has shown it has absolutely no control over Britain's borders and no intention of putting the British people first," he said.
In contrast to the fall in Romanian and Bulgarian workers, there was a spike in the number from Poland and other countries which entered the EU earlier, in 2004. Their numbers reached 802,000, up 74,000 from the final quarter of last year and nearly 17 per cent year on year.
The overall number of foreign workers – of all nationalities – in Britain reached 4,554,000, up 97,000 on the final quarter of 2013 and 7 per cent year on year. That included a 10.6 per cent rise in the total from all 27 EU countries, up from 1,580,000 in the first quarter of 2013 to 1,747,000.
The Tories have pledged to cut net migration, the difference between those entering the country and those leaving, to "tens of thousands" by next year, but that figure rose to 212,000 last year.
One minister admitted that the target looked like being missed. "At the moment we don't seem to be on course," Anna Soubry, a defence minister, told the BBC.
Keith Vaz MP, the Labour chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, called for the target to be revised and added: "Those, including Ukip, who promised the end of the world on Jan 1, now owe the public and those from Romania and Bulgaria a full apology."
