BOSSES using cheap illegal immigrants to undercut wages for British workers face lengthy jail terms under Labour plans.
Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper wants new laws to crack down on firms who exploit foreigners in sweatshop conditions.
She said: “We do not want to live in a society dependent on the exploitation of cheap migrant labour.
“It increases unfairness and resentment and should be illegal.

“We want clearer, stronger laws so businesses know where they stand and responsible employers know that they won’t be under-cut.
“Employers who use pressure or force to exploit workers and get round employment law are committing a crime.”
Labour will soon launch a nationwide consultation with businesses, trade unions and workers to look into the effects of the influx of cheap workers from abroad.
Ms Cooper wants to implement proper checks at the UK’s borders, including taking fingerprints of illegals to stop them trying to re-enter the UK.
