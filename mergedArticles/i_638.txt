News | The Opinion Matrix COMMENT FROM HOME & ABROAD BROKENSHIRE ON MIGRANTS
The Spectator No 10 can't escape its share of the blame for this fiasco. First, the speech should never have been cleared. Second, James Brokenshire should never have been appointed to this job. As one minister, a Cameron loyalist, complained: "Immigration is one of the four big subjects for the next year. You need to put a grown-up there." (James Forsyth) Sunday Telegraph This episode brings into sharp relief a phenomenon at the heart of a great deal of private talk at Westminster in the last few months, namely the extraordinary incompetence of the No 10 political machine. (Peter Oborne)
