GEORGE Osborne admits we'll probably have around 100,000 new migrants each year till 2018. The way things are going, that would be a spectacular result.
Net migration each year is at 212,000, despite the Tories' 2010 election pledge to slash it. The problem is they can do nothing about immigration from within Europe.
Cutting migration to the level they want will need huge, and welcome, changes to the EU's "freedom of movement" rules.
