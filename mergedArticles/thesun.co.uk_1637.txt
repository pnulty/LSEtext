ABUSE of Britain’s immigration rules by bogus students is getting WORSE, according to devastating evidence passed to the Home Secretary.
Documents seen by the Sun reveal routine breaches of the visa rules by institutions acting “negligently or deliberately".
At one private college, 397 students with visas prohibiting work were found to be earning more than £20,000 a year.
And students supposedly studying in Manchester were actually found to be living in Northern Ireland.
A separate institution recruited 70 students - but did not have any teaching staff for the course.
Home Secretary Theresa May detailed her concerns in a letter to Cabinet colleagues. She said: “Evidence uncovered by Visas and Immigration shows that abuse of the system has evolved, not disappeared."
Sources last night claimed the Lib Dems were blocking proposals to clamp down on the abuse.
This includes only allowing students to bring dependents if their course lasts for two years or more.
And the Home Secretary also wants penalties for universities who partner with private colleges found to be breaching visa rules.
One measure includes cutting the duration of short-term visas for inter-company employee transfers to the UK from 12 to 11 months.
Critics on Tuesday claimed this was purely designed to “cook the books" and cut migration numbers by 19,000.
Inter-company transfers only count as immigrants if they stay for 12 months.
A Government source last night said: “This isn’t about cooking the books, it’s about protecting our borders."
