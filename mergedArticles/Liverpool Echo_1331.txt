TWO people were arrested after a suspected sham marriage was stopped, moments before they were to be officially married.
Home Office immigration enforcement officers raided the wedding just before a 21-year-old French woman wed a Cameroonian man.
Investigators attended the ceremony at Winchester Register Office, in Hampshire, following a tip-off that it might not be genuine. Two further arrests were later made in connection with the investigation, at a property in High Street, Winchester.
