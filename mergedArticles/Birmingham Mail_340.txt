A COMPUTER glitch which caused lengthy delays for hundreds of passengers arriving at Birmingham Airport has been resolved.
Travellers arriving into the UK on Wednesday night were told to expect slow-moving queues as staff battled to resolve the IT issue causing hold-ups at passport control. However, engineers spent the night working on the Border Force computer system to rectify the problem.
Birmingham was one of a number of UK airports hit by delays, although Heathrow and Gatwick were worst affected.
A spokeswoman for Birmingham Airport said they had escaped any major problems, which saw delays of up to four hours for passengers arriving at some airports.
"The Border Force brought in extra staff and we were not affected that badly," she said. "Everything is now back to normal."
The technical problem affected immigration desks at airports and ports nationwide, resulting in lengthy queues. Passengers were affected when trying to enter the country, with a particular impact on non-EU airline customers.
A Government spokesman apologised for the problems, but added: "Our priority remains security of the border."
