Anti-terrorist police have made 40 arrests and conducted hundreds of searches in the first three months of this year, stopping Britons travelling to or from Syria.
The level of police activity has increased sharply since last year when there were 25 arrests. It signals growing concern among security officials over the danger to the lives of young men travelling to the conflict and the potential threat posed by Britons who have fought in Syria.
There were police raids at six addresses in London and the southeast yesterday which Scotland Yard said were carried out under the Terrorism Act. The latest arrests were disclosed last night before an appeal today to Muslim women to prevent their sons, husbands and brothers travelling to the war-torn country.
They came as US authorities revealed that a British citizen has been charged in the UK and is awaiting extradition to the US for his part in an alleged operation to smuggle chemical laboratory equipment into Syria.
A federal indictment unsealed in the US yesterday gave details of the alleged conspiracy to export lab equipment and items designed to detect chemical warfare agents. Ahmad Feras Diri, who lived in Muswell Hill, north London, was arrested by Scotland Yard officers in March last year, but his brother, named as Moawea Deri "remains at large and is considered a fugitive", US immigration and customs enforcement said. According to the charges, the men conspired to export items from 2003 to 2012, shipping them from the US through Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the UK to Syria.
In London Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball, senior national co-ordinator for counter-terrorism policing, said: "We are increasingly concerned about the numbers of young people who have or are intending to travel to Syria to join the conflict."
Ms Ball's comments echo the remarks of Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, who told The Times this year that counter-terrorism police were working with a number of families to stop loved ones from travelling to Syria. The appeal to women is designed to counteract the language of martyrdom, duty and sacrifice used by men who are raising money and recruiting for jihad in Muslim communities.
