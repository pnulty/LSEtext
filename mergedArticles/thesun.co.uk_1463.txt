For the first time, Jimmy Page has opened the band's vault and treated fans to newly digitally remastered albums - plus additional discs of previously unreleased material.
The legendary rockers, who have sold over 300million albums worldwide, are launching an extensive reissue program of all nine of their studio albums in chronological order, stating with Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, and Led Zeppelin III on June 2.
Jimmy said: "The material on the companion discs presents a portal to the time of the recording of Led Zeppelin.
“It is a selection of work in progress with rough mixes, backing tracks, alternate versions, and new material recorded at the time"
