IMMIGRATION has cost the UK £148billion since 1995, it was claimed last night.
Four million foreigners arriving over the past two decades have drained the country by £22million a day, according to a report.
Previous estimates suggested Britain had benefited from immigration by £25billion due to increased tax payments. But pressure group MigrationWatch UK claims that figure seriously overestimated how much immigrants earn — and underestimated the handouts they receive.
Taxpayers' cash spent on public services, housing and benefits for immigrants vastly outweighs any extra money received, its report calculates.
MigrationWatch UK chief Sir Andrew Green said: "This finally disposes of the immigration lobby's oft-repeated claims that immigration reduces our tax burden.
"The total cost is high and increased dramatically between 1995 and 2011, providing no compensation for the overcrowding of this island which we are experiencing, largely as a result of immigration."
And campaigners say the cost is set to continue — with a net influx of 212,000 migrants into Britain last year, destroying PM David Cameron's hopes of reducing levels to tens of thousands.
Meanwhile, officials admitted they have "terminated" the E-borders scheme after it was dogged by problems.
The plan — first devised by Labour in 2003 — was designed to count everyone in and out of the UK by collecting passenger information.
But UK Border Force head Sir Charles Montgomery told MPs it has now been abandoned. Home Affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz called it a "shambles".
