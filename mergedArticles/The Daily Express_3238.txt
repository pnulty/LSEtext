IAIN DUNCAN SMITH's measures to stop immigrants from claiming benefits until they have been in the country and earning at least £150 a week for three months come into force this month. It has also been confirmed that child benefit and child tax credit will be subject to the same three–month rule. This represents progress but it also shows how limited Government's powers really are.
He also said that he wants to do even more to prevent immigrants living off handouts from our Government by stopping them claiming benefits until they have been in this country for a year "no matter what the European Commission tries to tell us".
The Daily Express absolutely agrees with the sentiment but the chances of the Work and Pensions Secretary's grand rhetoric about defying Brussels actually leading to serious changes have to be regarded as close to zero.
Ultimately while Britain remains an EU member we are still subject to European diktats no matter how much Iain Duncan Smith – and the majority of the British public – may dislike the fact. We still have no power to prevent EU citizens from entering the country and no power to implement the extended benefit proposals that Mr Duncan Smith has put forward. Or at least we don't until we leave the EU.
