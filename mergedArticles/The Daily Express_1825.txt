NEARLY half of the children starting primary school in Bolton last year struggled to speak and understand English properly. This is in no small part due to immigration but it is also a dire failure on the part of the parents.
They owe it both to their children and to their new home to make sure that their offspring speak the local language proficiently.
Children who start school and haven't been taught to speak English will inevitably lag behind those who do so fluently. Furthermore any immigrants coming to this country should be willing and able to engage with our culture of which the language is a key component. Failure to learn English and take part in what makes Britain British will only invite division.
It is one thing for immigrants to teach their children their own language, but they must be able to speak English too. It is for their benefit and the benefit of the whole country.
