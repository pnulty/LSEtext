Foreign offenders awaiting deportation are being locked up for years after their sentences have ended in a potential breach of their human rights, the immigration watchdog has warned.
At the cost of tens of thousands of pounds to the taxpayer, the prisoners are being held because of delays in obtaining their travel documents. John Vine, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, uncovered one case that dragged of for more than three and a half years.
His findings come nearly eight years after chaos in the treatment of foreign criminals cost the Labour minister Charles Clarke his job as Home Secretary. After examining a sample of 27 ex-prisoners, Mr Vine found they spent an average of 17 months detained awaiting removal, at a cost of £86,000 each. One offender had been held for an extra 1,288 days at a cost of £211,000.
The Home Office said it was improving the use of emergency travel documents which played a "vital role in tackling and removing immigration offenders".
