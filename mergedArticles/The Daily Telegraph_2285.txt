MASS immigration has brought little or no overall financial benefit to Britain and other countries, a study of the world's leading economies has concluded.
Data from around the world over the past 50 years has shown that immigrants are not a "panacea" to economic growth, but nor are they a "major burden" on the taxpayer, the analysis by the Organisation for Economic Co–operation and Development (OECD) found.
Overall, the fiscal impact of migration in OECD countries has been "broadly neutral", with taxes paid by new arrivals usually matching what they receive in benefits. Although in some countries the amount that immigrants contribute to the public purse exceeds what they receive, new arrivals contribute less overall than the existing population, because many are less well paid.
The study is likely to be used by both sides in the immigration debate.
Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the campaign group MigrationWatch UK, said: "Gradually the claims for the benefits from immigration have been fading and this is another nail in the coffin."
A report by University College London last year concluded that European migrants contributed £8.8 billion more to the British taxpayer than they received over a 16–year period.
The OECD study said that whatever state benefits migrants had received was largely covered by the taxes they had paid. "But while the impact of immigrants on the public purse is, broadly speaking, neutral, it is less favourable than that of native–born people. In short, migrants are not a major burden on state spending, but nor are they a panacea for improving public finances."
International migrants account for around 12 per cent of the UK population, or 7.8 million people, the OECD said.
