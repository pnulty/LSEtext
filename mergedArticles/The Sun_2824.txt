FURIOUS Tories slammed David Cameron last night as his election pledge to slash immigration to "tens of thousands" lay in tatters.
Backbencher Nigel Mills called last year's huge surge a "disaster".
And he called for a fresh attempt to amend the Immigration Bill to introduce tighter restrictions. He told The Sun: "It shows how out of control immigration is and how we are not going to get anywhere near the target."
The immigration pledge was a key part of the Tory manifesto in 2010.
Another Conservative warned the PM had to live up to that promise or lose more votes to UKIP.
