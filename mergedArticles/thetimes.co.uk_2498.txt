Downing Street was last night accused of sitting on a report suggesting that immigration is not as damaging for British workers as previously thought.
The research is understood to state that the number of UK workers out of a job as a result of immigration is far lower than argued by Theresa May, the Home Secretary.
Mrs May has previously cited research from the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), as she suggested that “for every additional 100 immigrants... 23 British workers would not be employed".
However, a new analysis by civil servants is said by the BBC’s Newsnight to give far less weight to the impact of migrants. Downing Street is said to have stepped in to stop the release of the study.
The Government declined to comment on the report.
The row comes shortly after official figures revealed a steep rise in net immigration. Ministers are now unlikely to meet their pledge of reducing immigration to the tens of thousands by the next election.
Ministers have already rushed through restrictions on how quickly EU migrants can claim benefits in the UK in an attempt to reduce the “pull" factors attracting them to Britain. however, economic turmoil in Southern Europe has seen many migrants head to the UK.
