THE argument over foreign domestic staff makes everyone squirm. Danny Alexander defended the right to employ immigrants yet his description of his own domestic arrangements lacked conviction. "We use a brilliant British child minderâ€¦ and a Portuguese lady occasionally comes in to clean our home." Note the enthusiastic appropriation of the former, and the lacklustre, mildly surprised mention of the latter.
Meanwhile the Camerons choose a Nepalese nanny and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have hired a Spanish "supernanny". Prime ministers and royals in the past would have been likely to have recruited British nannies. I pass no judgment either way, but it is interesting that the same people who bang on about the need for us to buy British apples have no corresponding wish to bring British-born people into their houses.
