NIGEL FARAGE appeared to emerge on top after a bitter face-off against Nick Clegg in the second of their televised debates on the EU last night.
The UKIP leader was deemed to have performed best by 68 per cent of viewers, compared with 27 per cent who favoured the deputy prime minister, according to a YouGov poll.
Their hour-long exchange was more fractious than last week's encounter, with Mr Clegg repeatedly accusing his opponent of 'fantasy'.
He also picked up Mr Farage for 'indefensible' comments which suggested he admired Russian president Vladimir Putin for outwitting EU and Western politicians.
The Liberal Democrat leader accused Mr Farage of believing in conspiracy theories.
'I wouldn't be surprised if Nigel Farage soon tells us the Moon landing was fake, that Barack Obama is not American and Elvis is not dead,' Mr Clegg said.
Mr Farage said Mr Clegg was 'wilfully lying' about how many laws were imposed on Britain by the EU.
'I said yes to these debates. I thought you would honestly make the pro-EU case,' Mr Farage said.
'By saying seven per cent of our laws are made in Brussels, you are wilfully lying to the British people about the extent to which we have given away control of our country and our democracy. I'm really shocked and surprised that you would try and do that,' he added.
During one heated exchange, Mr Farage said immigration had been a disaster and left the 'white workingclass effectively as an underclass'.
