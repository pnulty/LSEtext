BANNING translators for driving theory tests is an excellent decision by the Government.
There will be some critics who will decry the ban as racist but making everyone take exams in English, Welsh or British sign language will help immigrants learn the language of their adopted country.
Since 2008 almost 1,300 passes have been revoked following investigations into the improper conduct of interpreters. 
Between February 2008 and December 2009 one in five tests using an interpreter was found to be fraudulent. That is a vast number of people to have progressed through the system despite falling short of the required knowledge.
Once they have passed the theory test learner drivers are then able to apply for the practical test, meaning they are just one step away from heading out on to the roads by themselves.
Cars are dangerous and we have to take all the precautions necessary to make sure that people are honestly good enough to warrant receiving their licence.
Transport Minister Stephen Hammond said: “By stopping driving tests in foreign languages we will cut out the risk of fraud and help to ensure that all drivers can read road signs and fully understand the rules of the road.”

Police budget wasted
IN 2011 Greater Manchester Police embarked on a project to reduce their outgoings by £134million. The cost-cutting exercise led to the loss of 1,500 jobs.
Despite these swingeing cuts the force also signed off a package to Cathy Butterworth worth nearly £900,000 over three years for her role in training and development.
Paying a middle manager such a vast sum of money is not in the public interest and was of deep concern to all those who lost their jobs during the cutbacks. It is a shocking waste of taxpayers’ money.
The Daily Express has no doubt that the people of Britain would much prefer their taxes to be spent on making sure there are police on our streets rather than spending vast amounts of money providing salaries, bonuses and pensions for management.

Dog days for Afghan hero
VIDAR the dog was declared a hero for helping the British military in Afghanistan. 
He has since been adopted by paramedic Angie McDonnell after he saved her life while they were both on duty in Helmand province by sniffing out a stash of Taliban weapons.
Angie said: “I would have done anything to make sure he had a loving home.” 
He certainly does now.
