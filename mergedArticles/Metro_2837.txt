IMMIGRATION figures surged last year by more than double the government's target of 100,000 The net migration figure of 212,000 for the 12 months to September 2013 was a rise of more than 30 per cent on the previous year, according to the Office For National Statistics.
Scott Blinder, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: 'The key changes in this report are to EU migration - an area over which immigration policy has less direct influence.
'This highlights the fact that the net migration target is not something that can be delivered purely through policy, but relies on other trends as well.' The highest increases came from Poland, Spain, Italy and Portugal.
There was also a 'statistically significant' leap in the number of Romanians and Bulgarians arriving, with 24,000 coming last year, compared with 9,000 the year before. The number of non-EU citizens decreased to 244,000 in the period, from 269,000 the previous year.
Statisticians said this was due to fewer New Commonwealth citizens - such as those from India - choosing to study in Britain.
Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the figures show the government's target was 'in tatters, and their immigration policy is a mess'.
Immigration and security minister James Brokenshire said the focus was 'on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and seeking to address the factors that drive European immigration to Britain.' Overall, 532,000 people immigrated to Britain, up from 497,000 who arrived during the previous year.
A total of 320,000 people left, down from 343,000 the year before.
