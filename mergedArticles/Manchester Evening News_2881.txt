VIEWPOINTS
IN Viewpoints (March 25), there was an article referring to human rights and noting that convicted criminals are making a mockery of the law.
There was a case a short time ago where a convicted criminal was appealing to overturn his deportation on the grounds that he was entitled to 'family life.' .
This man had entered the country illegally on a false passport and during his stay had fathered five children in six years. This man has been granted legal aid to take his appeal to court.
Could anyone please explain to me how an illegal immigrant is entitled to legal aid? If the case is won at taxpayers expense he will then be claiming benefits, again at taxpayers expense.
Puzzled, Manchester
