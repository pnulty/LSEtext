From Mr Tony Golding.
Sir, Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, makes an important and often overlooked point when he says: "It requires a special kind of person to emigrate" ("Bloomberg urges UK to welcome migrants", April 23). It is not the average member of a society who chooses to move to another country, but those with initiative, drive, a strong work ethic and a willingness to adapt to a new environment, both linguistically and culturally. The average British worker therefore finds himself competing with an above-average immigrant. For obvious reasons. This is not something politicians care to talk about.
Tony Golding, London W4, UK
