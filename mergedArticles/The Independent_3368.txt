FILMS OF THE WEEK FILM CHOICE
Sunday
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope
7.30PM ITV2
(George Lucas, 1977) The film that used to be called just plain Star Wars is by far the most satisfying and the most fun entry in what was later to become a voracious and ever-expanding cinematic and industrial franchise. At the same time a mythopoetic, visually spectacular and iconic space opera, and a throwaway entertainment knowingly modelled on old matinee adventure serials, it is about an orphaned teenager on a remote farm in a galaxy far, far away, who discovers magical powers and uses them to defeat an evil empire. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford (all above) head the cast.

Saturday
Gone Baby Gone
10.40PM BBC2
(Ben Affleck, 2007) At the first attempt (and, it must be said, against expectations), Ben Affleck proved himself a film-maker of subtlety and skill. Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan play the Boston private investigator duo searching for a missing girl in this adaptation of a book by Dennis Lehane: a terrific, downbeat, naturalistic crime drama, full of complex moral ambiguities. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris also star.

Monday
I Was a Male War Bride
4PM SKY MOVIES GREATS
(Howard Hawks, 1949) A French army captain (Cary Grant) and an American officer (Ann Sheridan) fall in love during a wartime mission and get married, but army and immigration bureaucrats put obstacles in the way of them consummating their union, and an increasingly frustrated Cary Grant has to spend much of the film as a woman. Witty and charming screwball stuff.

Tuesday
Brighton Rock
11AM FILM4
(John Boulting, 1947) The Boulting brothers' brilliant, cruel, noir-ish Graham Greene adaptation makes fine use of its locations. It takes place not only in a jolly pre-war seaside town but in "another Brighton of dark alleyways and festering slums"; and, most of all, inside the oppressively godless and paranoid psyche of its young hoodlum antihero, Pinkie Brown (Richard Attenborough).

Wednesday
Went the Day Well?
2.25PM FILM4
(Alberto Cavalcanti, 1942) Brambly End is an ordinary, pretty, sleepy and remote English village, until a fifth columnist invites a troupe of Nazis to stay and the villagers must take extreme measures to repel them. Ealing Studios' 1942 Graham Greene adaptation is a bracing if not downright subversive propaganda film, an endearing time capsule, and a still highly effective action thriller.

Thursday
An Officer and a Gentleman
11.05PM FILM4
(Taylor Hackford, 1982) There's more to this hit Cinderella story than just a famous theme song and Richard Gere in uniform. The love affair between Gere's naval cadet and Debra Winger's factory worker is credible and sexy, and thrown into relief by the cynicism the rest of the film shows towards gender relations. And Louis Gossett Jr is great value as Gere's hard-ass instructor.

Friday
The Day the Earth Stood Still
3.05PM FILM4
(Robert Wise, 1951) In this atomic-era sci-fi parable, the Earth is visited by Klaatu, the Christ-like emissary of a collective of alien civilisations who wish to warn mankind to curb its destructive tendencies. Bernard Herrmann's score and much of the film's imagery have achieved an iconic status, untarnished by the unwise 2008 remake.
