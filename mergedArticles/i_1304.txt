News | The Opinion Matrix COMMENT FROM HOME & ABROAD IMMIGRATION STATISTICS
The Guardian The first thing to say is that [David Cameron] should stop taking silly positions. His problem here is EU migration. He can't do much about that. He shouldn't have given the impression that events outside his control were within it. He can't change the rules because his EU partners won't let him. And regardless of the chunterings from his backbenchers, he knows that to actually leave the EU - the only way to regain complete control - would be ruinous for Britain in terms of economics and world positioning... People flows and money flows are how the modern world works. (Hugh Muir)
