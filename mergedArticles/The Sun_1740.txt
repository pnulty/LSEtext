HOLLYWOOD funnymen Will Ferrell and John C Reilly are reportedly teaming up for a third movie. The actors, who appeared in Step Brothers and Talladega Nights, are in talks to star in a new comedy Border Guards.
They will play hapless pals who decide they must protect America's borders from illegal immigrants trying to enter. But the duo then find themselves stranded in Mexico without proper ID and must find a way back to the US.
Anchorman director Adam McKay is lined up to helm the buddy comedy — while Ferrell will co-write the script.
