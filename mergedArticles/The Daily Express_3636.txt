OSCAR-WINNING lyricist Sir Tim Rice has become the latest high-profile figure to donate funds to the UK Independence Party.
Ukip treasurer Stuart Wheeler said Sir Tim, 69, whose hits include Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar, gave the cash about a year ago.
Mr Wheeler, a wealthy former Tory donor, said: "He was very friendly."
The sum is thought to be less than Â£7,500, the threshold at which the party would have to declare it. Sir Tim yesterday refused to confirm if he had given Ukip money. He said any "close contact" was a long time ago. There was no "vast sum" and he added: "I don't fully back any party."
Tory former Deputy Premier Lord Heseltine yesterday criticised Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's decision to debate EU membership with Ukip leader Nigel Farage.
He said: "It is a misjudgement to equate the leadership of a party which is part of government with a protest group, particularly a group which is more about immigration than it is about Europe."
