NEARLY one in three seats in the European Parliament will go to ANTI-EU parties next month, a think tank claims.
Open Europe said anti-EU and anti-immigrant parties such as Ukip will take 29 per cent, or 218, of the seats in the European Elections on May 22 - up from 21 per cent in 2009.
But the surge will make it HARDER for David Cameron to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Brussels.
Open Europe said anti-EU parties will pick up their votes from “reformers" - such as the Tories.
Pro-EU parties in Europe are likely to keep the seats they already have in Brussels.
And experts fear they will push for MORE integration after the Elections.
Pawel Swidlicki, Open Europe analyst said: “The effect of a potential anti-EU surge shouldn’t be over stated.
“But a more polarised, Commission hugging European Parliament would further complicate the political landscape in Europe.
“And it may prove one of the biggest obstacles to David Cameron’s reform agenda."
As well as Ukip, France’s Front National, the Finns Party in Finland and the Danish People’s Party in Denmark have been picking up huge support in their countries.
Open Europe said “outright fascist" parties in Greece and Hungary were likely to pick up seats.
