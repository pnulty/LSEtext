A young Polish woman with the colours of her national flag painted on her face was among protesters who gathered near Downing Street yesterday.
A few hundred Poles living in Britain held a rally to raise awareness of discrimination against Polish people living in the UK.
The protest highlighted the recent attack on a Polish biker in a pub car park in Dagenham, London, last month. Around 15 people attacked the man, who had a Polish flag emblazoned on his motorcycle helmet.
Representatives of the Polish Youth Association Patriae Fidelis and the Polish Bikers group said this was not an isolated example of the discrimination.
In an open letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, the organisers also referred to his recent remarks in which he accused Poles of abusing child benefit. The letter said: "This is insulting to all hardworking taxpayers in the UK."
It added that "according to recent University College London studies, Poles have contributed with their taxes 34 per cent more to the economy when compared to the benefits taken, more than any other minority and even the British themselves."
