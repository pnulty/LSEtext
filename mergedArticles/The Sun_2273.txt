EURO ELECTIONS: ONE DAY TO GO Victory 'not impossible'
WINNING next year's general election will be "very tough" David Cameron has admitted for the first time — but he said it was "not impossible".
He revealed the challenge he faces to stay in power in an interview with Sun Cabbie Grant Davis ahead of tomorrow's Euro and council elections. The PM claimed he "understands" why so many people will vote Ukip tomorrow — and issued his biggest plea yet to defecting Tories to return to the fold.
Mr Cameron said: "There are a lot of decent people who do not have a racist bone in their body who are thinking of voting Ukip.
"They are frustrated by Europe. They want to see action on welfare.
I understand that. I am on your side and I can deliver those things."
And on the 2015 election, he added: "It is going to be very tough. My argument is that it's doable."
He admitted that he will not have "finished the job" on immigration by then, but insisted he will succeed in his EU renegotiation because he will "get another treaty".
Our poll on how people will vote tomorrow shows Labour and Ukip tied on 27 per cent, with the Tories on 23 per cent. In a survey of those certain to vote, Nigel Farage's party leads by five points.
George Osborne will today blast Ukip and Labour as "forces of pessimism". tom.newton dunn@the-sun.co.uk CABBIE MEETS CAMMIE SEE PAGE 15
