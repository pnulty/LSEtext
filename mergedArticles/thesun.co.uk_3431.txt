EXCLUSIVE . Handouts up to TEN times more generous than Romania and Bulgaria's - and easier to claim
BRITAIN was branded a soft touch last night after it emerged our handouts are up to TEN times more generous than Romania and Bulgaria's - and far easier to claim.
The Sun investigation findings came as official statistics revealed a new tidal wave of 168,000 more European workers to the UK over the last year alone.
It included 115,000 more from the newer 'A8' EU countries - Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia.
And there were also almost 29,000 extra Romanians and Bulgarians in jobs here, taking their total to 140,000.
There was a small drop of 4,000 from the two newest Eastern European countries since controls on them were lifted in January.
Yesterday's figures meant there are now 1.74 million European newcomers working in the UK - a jumbo rise of more than 10% in a year.
The Sun investigated the three biggest benefits paid out in Britain, Romania and Bulgaria - two of which also go to people who work.
Our investigation revealed:
- On the dole; in Romania the jobless only get £29 per week and in Bulgaria they get £46 a week - but on both countries only for a maximum of 12 months, and only if they have worked for 10 years.
In the UK, the jobless over 25 get £71.70 a week and there is no time limit.
- On Child benefit; Romanian parents get £9 a week for children aged up to two, and just £2 a week for kids aged 3-18, while Bulgarians get just £14.75 a month.
In the UK, it's £20.30 per week for the eldest child and £13.40 for each additional child.
- On Housing Benefit; Romania pays out just £40 a week and under tough conditions, such as the claimer never having owned a property before - and in Bulgaria it doesn't exist.
But in Britain, claimers can get a maximum of £500 a week if they aren't claiming any other handouts.
Tory MP Nigel Mills said: "Whether you're coming to work or claim benefits, Britain is a very attractive option.
"You're so much better off here rather than there."
David Cameron yesterday insisted that three quarters of the record number of 283,000 new jobs created in the last three months went to British born workers.
But the Premier was dealt a blow when his own Tory Defence Minister Anna Soubry admitted the Government does not "seem to be on course" to meet his pledge to slash net migration down to below 100,000 by the next election.
Lib Dem cabinet minister Danny Alexander leaped on the slight fall in Romanians and Bulgarian workers here since January to insist the statistics "give the lie to Ukip's scaremongering".
Mr Alexander claimed: "The very modest numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians coming to work in Britain this year is in stark contrast to the inflammatory rhetoric of earlier this year".
But critics pointed out yesterday's figures do not yet include dependants and immigrants who aren't working.
Migration Watch UK Chairman Sir Andrew Green also stood by his prediction that 250,000 more Romanians and Bulgarians will come to Britain over the next five years
Sir Andrew said: "Quarterly statistics fluctuate but these figures show an increase of 28,000 Romanians and Bulgarians in employment compared to the same period last year.
"Most of this has occurred when transitional controls were still in place, making it likely that there will be an increase in employment over the coming year now that controls have ended."
