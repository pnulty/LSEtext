Fury at massive rise in handouts
BRITISH taxpayers have shelled out £140billion on migrants since 1995.
UK workers have been forking out £22million every day on foreigners for the past 17 years.
And a study by MigrationWatch UK says that what immigrants pay into the system is dwarfed by what they receive in government handouts.
Chairman Sir Andrew Green said: "Our report finally disposes of the immigration lobby's oft-repeated claims that immigration reduces our tax burden.
"The total cost is high and increased dramatically between 1995 and 2011.
"It has provided absolutely no compensation for the overcrowding of this island." MigrationWatch UK laid into a paper from the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration at University College London, which was published in November last year.
It said immigrants were "less likely" than Brits to receive benefits or live in council housing.
It also claimed that immigrants contributed 34% more in taxes than they received in handouts.
But MigrationWatch UK has disputed all their findings.
