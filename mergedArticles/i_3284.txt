A blow to the message of Nigel Farage
Daily Telegraph
Those who claim to want an "honest and open debate" about immigration actually want to lie: 26 million Europeans are after your job. They want to scare and smear. Ukip are running a campaign built upon racist populism and a lie. And today was the day the lie was finally nailed. (Dan Hodges)
Business Times
The numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians was comprehensively demolished. It is not ... "people coming over here to steal our jobs". It is a massive issue about unscrupulous employers deliberately bringing in cheap labour. (Nick Assinder)
