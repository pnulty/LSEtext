A STUDENT fighting deportation had a last–minute reprieve after British Airways refused to take her on a flight from Gatwick Airport, according to her MP.
Yashika Bageerathi, 19, was taken back to Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre, Beds, where she had been held since losing an appeal last Wednesday. She fled Mauritius with her mother and brother in 2012 to escape a relation who had been physically abusing her.
A campaign by fellow pupils at the Oasis Academy Hadley in Enfield, north London, to allow the aspiring maths teacher to complete her A–levels, generated a 23,000–signature petition and support from Cara Delevingne, the model.
The student's MP, David Burrowes, said the Home Office told him BA had refused to take Miss Bageerathi on the plane but neither the airline nor the Home Office would comment.
