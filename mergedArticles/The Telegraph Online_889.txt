Country music singer-songwriter Brigitte DeMeyer's new album Savannah Road features distinguished guitarist Will Kimbrough
Savannah Road is a very personal album, whose stripped-down sound brings out the best from Brigitte DeMeyer's fine voice.
The album features distinguished guitarist Will Kimbrough (who co-wrote 10 of the 13 tracks here alongside DeMeyer) and is full of thoughtful and assured songs.
DeMeyer recorded the majority of the album in her own home studio and, for the first time in a career that now stretches to six solo albums, she self-produced the record, calling on the advice of drummer and former producer Brady Blade. The result is a melodic and subtle sound.
Among the highlights are the sultry Honey Hush, a love song called Say You Will be Mine, the moving Home Ground and Worker, which bounces along. DeMeyer, who was born in Michigan to Belgian-German immigrants, writes poignantly about her mother's experiences in the Second World War in the song Build Me a Fire.
The title track, Savannah Road, was inspired by Gregg Allman’s book My Cross to Bear.
This is soulful Americana of a very high standard.
