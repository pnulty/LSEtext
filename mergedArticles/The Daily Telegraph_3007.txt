POLISH immigrants travelling home to visit their families have helped push their country into the top 10 foreign destinations for British residents, figures show.
For the first time, Poland appears alongside Spain, France and the US on the list of the 10 nations with the most visitors from Britain, with 1.7million visits made last year, according to the Office for National Statistics.
But while most of the top 10 countries are principally visited by tourists, some 70 per cent of visits to Poland were to see family and friends. Just 20 per cent visited the country as tourists and seven per cent on business, with the remainder of visits listed as "miscellaneous" by the ONS.
Poland was also among the top 10 sources of visitors last year, with 1.4million arriving in the UK. Four in 10 came to visit friends and family and 42 per cent for business, with just 14 per cent on holiday.
The French made the most visits to Britain last year, with 3.9million crossing the Channel, but they were only the 37th most generous, spending an average of just £71 per day.
In contrast, visitors from the Middle East were the most lavish spenders, parting with an average of £173 each day.
In total there were 33million visits to Britain by visitors from all countries, more than ever before, who spent a record £21billion.
