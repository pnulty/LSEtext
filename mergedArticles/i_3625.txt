Nick Clegg will have a "tough gig" debating Britain's European Union membership with Ukip leader Nigel Farage in a head-to-head debate, senior Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes has admitted.
But the Justice Minister insisted the Deputy Prime Minister was "hugely qualified" to take on the charismatic Mr Farage, who on Friday accepted Mr Clegg's challenge to a public debate on the EU.
Tory grandee Lord Heseltine called Mr Clegg's challenge a "misjudgment". Mr Hughes, former deputy leader of the Lib Dems. told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: "Of all the people equipped to know the history and the workings of the EU and its benefits and has also had to argue this case lately I think Nick is hugely well qualified."
Lord Heseltine described Ukip as an isolationist party that is more concerned with immigration than Europe. The former Cabinet minister told Sky News: "I wouldn't do it if I was him [Mr Clegg]. I think that it's a misjudgment, frankly, to equate the leadership of a party which is part of government with a protest group."
