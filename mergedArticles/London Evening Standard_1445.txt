BORIS bikes-to-DLR operator Serco today revealed just how battered it was by the electronic prisoner tagging scandal last year.
Pre-tax profits slumped by 62% to £107 million and the group, which poached Aggreko's Rupert Soames as its new chief executive last week, said this year will be just as tough.
Acting chief executive Ed Casey said the group is internally forecasting a mid-single digit fall in revenues this year as it loses a large chunk of immigration work in Australia. It also warned that profit margins would be 0.5% to 1% lower than last year.
That all adds up to operating profits of between £220 million and £250 million for 2014, down from £285 million last year. Revenues will fall from £5.1 billion in 2013 to between £4.7 billion and £4.9 billion.
Much depends on the award or renewal of major contracts, many with the UK Government which suspended contract awards with it through the second half of 2013 up until January of this year when it gave the company a clean bill of health.
Casey said: "The outlook for 2014 remains challenging, with lower profits anticipated. We will continue our efforts to rebuild the confidence of our UK Government customer and strengthen the Group as a whole through the... corporate renewal programme. There is ongoing demand in large and growing markets for our services, with a pipeline of opportunities to take the business forward."
Serco shares, which bounced 10% on Soames's appointment, rose 5.65p to 455.45p. The dividend has been raised 4.5% to 10.55p a share.
"Whilst we welcomed Friday's announcement that Mr Soames would become chief executive, he will have his work cut out. Serco is in need of serious repair," said Sam Thomas of brokers Cantor Fitzgerald.
Serco was rocked by the discovery that it had overcharged the Department of Justice for tagging criminals, which led to the departure of chief executive Chris Hyman, and two profit warnings. It is still the subject of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.
Serco said that its current order book is down about £2 billion at £17.1 billion, while it is bidding for contracts, many with the UK Government, totalling £12 billion.
