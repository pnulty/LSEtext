THE UK Independence Party is poised to "deliver a blow to the political class from which they will never recover", leader Nigel Farage said in a rallying cry yesterday.
He pledged to speak up for the "silent majority" in Britain in the run-up to the Euro elections in May.
And he promised that his anti-Brussels party was on the verge of an electoral breakthrough that would send an "earthquake" through British politics.
Voice He said: "Together we can get our country back."
Speaking at his party's spring conference in Torquay, Devon, he said: "For the next three months our national campaign is about being the voice of the people.
"It is wholly unacceptable to me that our country has been given away."
He added: "Immigration has now become the number one issue in British politics.
"We cannot have our own immigration policy and remain a member of the European Union."
He said no one had been asked over the opening up of the borders from eastern Europe, which doubled youth unemployment.
