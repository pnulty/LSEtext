GEORGE Osborne has admitted there will be "around a hundred thousand" more immigrants to Britain every year — destroying a prized Tory target.
During questioning MPs on the Budget, the Chancellor conceded official predictions have new arrivals running at a net influx of 150,000 a year.
And that has been projected to last FOUR years, until 2018.
It is a blow for David Cameron's 2010 election pledge to slash immigration to below 100,000 a year. Mr Osborne still insisted to the Treasury Committee yesterday: "The Government's stated policy is to reduce it to the tens of thousands."
He also said moves to boost Britain's lapsed savings habit will take time to kick in, comparing it to "turning around a supertanker". Meanwhile, Labour last night challenged the effects of a £100 income tax cut which comes in on Sunday with the new tax year.
Households will be £974 a year worse off by the time of the General Election due to the tax and benefit changes since 2010, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated.
Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "David Cameron is trying to tell working people they are better off, but he's not fooling anybody."
