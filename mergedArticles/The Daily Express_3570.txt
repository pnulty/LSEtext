A LIB Dem plan to make jobless EU immigrants wait twice as long before they can claim benefits could be illegal, Tories warned yesterday.
Conservative sources also suspect Nick Clegg's party is calling for the move to shore up votes for May's European Parliament election and prove it is not "soft" on immigration before 2015's general election.
It would stop EU migrants applying for handouts for six months - double the three-month wait brought in by the Coalition this year amid fears of an influx of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria.
Mr Cameron is said to want a tougher regime but he believes it must wait until after the general election when EU rules can be renegotiated.
