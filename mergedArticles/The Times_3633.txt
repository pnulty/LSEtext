Nick Clegg should never have challenged the UKIP leader Nigel Farage to a debate, Lord Heseltine has said.
The former Deputy Prime Minister dismissed the party as a "protest group" and said that the current Deputy Prime Minister should not entertain it.
Mr Clegg invited Mr Farage last week to a debate over Britain's membership of the EU. "I wouldn't do it if I was him [Mr Clegg]," Lord Heseltine said. "I think that it's a misjudgment, frankly, to equate the leadership of a party which is part of Government with a protest group ... more about immigration than it is about Europe."
Speaking on Sky News' Murnaghan programme, he dismissed UKIP as "isolationist".
"We have never been isolated from Europe, our politics have always been absolutely interwoven with Europe," he added.
