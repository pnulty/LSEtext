'1,000 immigrants inside'
TOWN hall chiefs used a spy plane to check on 75 suspected "beds in sheds" - and found 319.
They believe more than 1,000 exploited migrant workers are living in the squalid homes.
Prime Minister David Cameron has ordered a crackdown on the dodgy properties after viewing some himself.
It is thought hundreds of thousands of migrants live in outhouses across the UK.
The latest were found in Harrow, west London, with thermal imaging kit in a plane hired by the council.
Human heat shows which sheds have people in them. Many of those in the sheds and garages - often with running water - are being exploited by British landlords. One paid Â£55 a week to sleep on a mattress in a room with two other people.
The end of immigration restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians on January 1 has led to concerns that more sheds will be converted.
Harrow Council leader Susan Hall said: "The pressures of migration in London, fuelled by recent waves of new arrivals from eastern Europe, are creating new stresses on local authorities.
"A hidden community is springing up in back gardens."
She added: "We get complaints from neighbours. It is not fair on them that these houses should turn into cash cows for opportunist landlords."
