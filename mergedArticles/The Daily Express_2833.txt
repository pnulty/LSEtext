? THE UK will need another 80,000 accountants by 2050, warns specialist recruitment firm Randstad Financial & Professional.
It says the number of qualified accountants has fallen by 18,000 to 76,000 since 2008, as tough visa rules mean skilled immigrants have not replaced the exodus of accountants moving to highly paid jobs abroad.
If the usual laws of supply and demand apply surely UK firms will push up salaries? That should be good news for universities churning out wannabe number crunchers.
