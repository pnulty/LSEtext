Festive special 'in bag'
DOLE queen White Dee is set to make a telly comeback with a Benefits Street Christmas Special.
Channel 4 chiefs are planning a return to Birmingham's James Turner Street, to be screened during the festive season.
The one-off show will reveal how the main characters have fared since the fly-on-the-wall series ended. Bosses at Love Productions, who are behind the show, have been accused of exploiting the claimants and making "poverty porn".
And their hopes of making a second series at another location have run into problems.
Residents and community leaders in Grimsby, Liverpool and Stockton-on-Tees have all hit out at suggestions they were being targeted.
They believe the documentary damaged the image of Birmingham and would cause them similar problems.
Attempts to make another show, entitled Immigrant Street, in Southampton have also been resisted by locals.
A TV executive said: "Benefits Street may be struggling to cast a second series. But there's a Christmas special in the bag."
Mum-of-two Dee, 42, real name Deirdre Kelly, snubbed showbiz deals worth £100,000 to stay on state handouts of about £200 a week. She has not worked since 2007 when she lost her job with Birmingham City Council after stealing £13,000 from them.
