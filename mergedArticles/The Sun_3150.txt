Equals Cardiff's population
ALMOST 350,000 more immigrants than previously thought moved to Britain under Labour.
Statistics chiefs yesterday admitted they had underestimated the flow of people between 2001 and 2011.
Revised figures show they miscalculated by 346,000 — equal to the population of Cardiff.
The Office of National Statistics said it concentrated only on arrivals to Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester airports. But higher numbers of migrants came in via regional airports, as budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair spread across Europe.
The ONS also under-estimated arrivals from outside the EU and children aged under 15 were often not counted.
Immigration minister James Brokenshire said the Government was committed to cutting the numbers.
He said: "Labour let it get out of control for years. We have tightened up the system."
Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has vowed Labour will count every arrival in and out of the country.
