LABOUR'S IAN IN FANCY DRESS ROW
AN anti-racism MP happily poses for a photo with his son — who is blacked up to look like Michael Jackson.
Labour politician Ian Lavery, 51, was snapped with 25-year-old Ian Jnr, who wore the Thriller outfit to a fancy dress party.
The son posted the picture online at the weekend and it triggered a string of racist comments — all of which the warehouse worker "liked".
One pal called him a "liquorice stick", a second dubbed him "Lanky the n*gga" and a third wrote: "ha ha f***in mint your dads probably thinking whos the immigrant".
But another lad blasted the make-up as "appallingly racist" and added: "For the MP to have his photo taken with his son in this costume shows total disrespect."
Ian Jnr also posted another snap of himself as Jacko holding his crotch, right, on his public Facebook page.
The snaps emerged weeks after his dad, who is MP for Wansbeck, Northumberland, threw his support behind a Stand up to Racism and Fascism rally later this month. In January he attended a Show Racism the Red Card event.
Yesterday the MP, an ex-president of the National Union of Mineworkers, denied the fancy dress stunt was racist, saying: "Absolute nonsense."
A few minutes later the Facebook page was taken down.
Ian Jnr, of Ashington, Northumberland — who last week wrote: "I AM NOT STUPID I JUST DONT THINK!" — declined to comment.
He was blasted last April over a sick tweet he posted about Katie Price's disabled son Harvey.
