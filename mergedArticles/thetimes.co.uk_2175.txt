Benjamin Britten: A Life in the Twentieth Century by Paul Kildea
The book’s flaw is chiefly Kildea’s relish for a grandstanding phrase. However, all is forgiven for the wicked anecdotes Kildea has dug up about this seminal era: David Hockney musing on the ageing Auden’s wrinkled visage (“if his face looks like this, what on earth must his balls look like?"); or Britten accepting a fifty-quid commission to churn out a national anthem for Malaysia, only for the Malaysians to reject it; or the Lord Chamberlain demanding that the emptying of a chamber-pot be removed from the staging of Gloriana, because it might upset the Royal Family. Truly a fascinating portrait of a genius, warts and all. And boy, there were plenty. Richard Morrison

Red Love: The Story of an East German Family by Maxim Leo
Wolf, Maxim Leo’s father, was 19 when the Berlin Wall went up in 1961; Maxim was 19 when it fell in 1989. Between these dates, three generations of the Leo family — bohemian Wolf and his idealistic wife, Anne, socialist war-hero grandfather Gerhard and the westernised boy Maxim — lived in a counter-Tolstoyan spirit of being happy (if often conflicted) in their own way. So far from being a misery memoir, Leo’s account of family life in the German Democratic Republic is written without political rancour or historical revisionism. Iain Finlayson
Red Love: The Story of an East German Family by Maxim Leo, Pushkin, 264pp, £8.99; e-book £6.99. To buy this book for £8.54, visit thetimes.co.uk/bookshop or call 0845 2712134
Cruel Crossing: Escaping Hitler Across the Pyrenees by Edward Stourton
A wonderful account, which captures the now-aged memories of brave and resourceful Brits as they escaped from Nazi brutality and occasional French perfidy. These are gripping stories that make you ask “what would I have done" if faced with an escapee needing help? Many of those who did help were women who took huge risks and often paid the ultimate price. Andrew Mitchell
Cruel Crossing: Escaping Hitler Across the Pyrenees by Edward Stourton, Black Swan, 480pp, £9.99; e-book £11.99. To buy this book for £9.49, visit thetimes.co.uk/bookshop or call 0845 2712134
Fiction
We Need New Names by NoViolet Bulawayo
Ten-year-old Darling once lived with her parents in a house in Zimbabwe. It was bulldozed by the government and she’s now one of a pack of kids in a shanty town called Paradise — “tiny shack after tiny shack crammed together like hot loaves of bread". Her father has gone to South Africa to find work, and comes back only to die of Aids. Her 11-year-old friend is pregnant. This story is sometimes shocking, often heartbreaking — but also pulsing with colour and energy. Darling and her friends steal guavas from rich people’s houses, and dream of escaping to Europe or America. And suddenly, Darling really is in America, with her aunt Fostalina who lives in “Destroyedmichygen"; a run-down and snowy Detroit. Bulawayo conveys the culture shock brilliantly. Kate Saunders
We Need New Names by NoViolet Bulawayo, Vintage, 289pp, £7.99; e-book £9.49. To buy this book for £7.59, visit thetimes.co.uk/bookshop or call 0845 2712134
Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie
Adichie has chosen to look at the subject head-on, to do what her writer character declares is impossible to do in America, to write “an honest novel about race". She has done so with guts and lustre, and she has done it within the context of a well-crafted, compassionate, visceral and delicately funny tale of lasting high-school love and the sorrows and adventures of immigration. Diana Evans
Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie , 4th Estate, 477pp, £8.99; e-book £8.99. To buy this book for £8.54, visit thetimes.co.uk/bookshop or call 0845 2712134
