MINISTERS are drawing up major policies in secret to avoid their coalition partners knowing what they are doing, it has emerged.
Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are keeping their rivals out of the loop if the discussions are deemed 'too sensitive', according to senior civil servants.
The culture of secrecy in some government departments was exposed by a think-tank which carried out interviews with Whitehall staff.
It found that the way the coalition operated varied from department to department - often depending on the personality of the secretary of state.
In its report, the Institute for Government highlighted the Home Office anti-immigration 'go home' advertising vans as an example of 'an actual policy pilot being rolled out without consultation with the other party'.
In some ministries there was a culture of openness but in others policy development was sometimes carried out solely by one party 'occasionally with explicit requests not to include the other side in discussions'.
The report said: 'There is a lack of clarity in such circumstances about whether policy is being developed for the government, or for one party.
'This can also strain working relations within a department.
'In one case, a secretary of state instructed officials to keep junior ministers out of the loop because of concerns they would pass on sensitive information to the party leader.' The think-tank called on David Cameron and Nick Clegg to publish a set of 'rules of the game' for the last year of the coalition government.
It warned there was a risk of 'unfairness' to the Lib Dems in drawing up policies with the aid of civil servants, because the Tories run more ministries.
