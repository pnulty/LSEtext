MINISTERS have vowed to fight EU plans to take Britain to court for restricting benefits for immigrants.
Brussels bureaucrats are expected to raise the action in the European Court of Justice in the next few months.
The row centres on the “right to reside" test in which migrants must prove they are genuinely seeking work before they are eligible for welfare.
But the European Commission said the rule “discriminates unfairly" against foreigners in the UK and breaks rules on access to benefits.
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: “It’s right we ensure our system is secure. We do not accept the Commission’s views and will defend the test against any challenge."
Meanwhile, peers have called for national parliaments to be given powers to change EU laws.
