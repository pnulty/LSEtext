MORE than half a million EU migrants are expected to flood Britain over the next five years - more than the population of Manchester, a report warns today.
Migration Watch UK said net migration from the EU was likely to remain at about 130,000 a year until at least 2019 - leaving the Government's immigration policy in tatters.
The report piles fresh pressure on David Cameron to win back controls over immigration after The Sun issued a "red line" demand to him last year.
Latest figures show that net immigration from the continent DOUBLED in the last year to a record 131,000.
It took the total number of arriving Europeans to a massive 209,000 - up from 149,000 in 2012 - while only 78,000 left.
Meanwhile immigration from outside Europe has fallen dramatically due to tough new Government rules.
But ministers are powerless to stem the tide of immigrants from the EU due to barmy freedom of movement rules.
In a major report, Migration Watch UK estimated that net migration from the EU over the "medium term" - defined as five years - would run at 130,000 a year.
That is roughly the population of Manchester arriving here - around 520,000 - every four years.
The figures add extra spice to the fresh EU showdown between Deputy PM Nick Clegg and UKIP leader Nigel Farage tonight.
The campaign group blamed the economic crisis in southern Europe as well as the EU's eastwards expansion into Romania and Bulgaria.
Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said "The good news is that immigration from outside the EU is coming down steadily as the government have promised.
"The bad news is that migrants from the EU have driven the policy off course.
"It was crazy to have opened up our labour market and our benefit system to one hundred million people from countries with a standard of living less than a quarter of our own.
"There must now be a determined renegotiation".
He called on ministers to close the benefit system to migrants unless they had worked here for five years.
The report points out that workers from Eastern Europe are on low wages which are subsidised by UK taxpayers in the form of tax credits and housing benefit.
