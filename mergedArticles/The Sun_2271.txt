BORDER posts may have to be introduced on the British mainland if Scotland votes Yes, MPs say.
It could mean travellers having to show their passports to cross south of the border.
The warning comes as a report says Scotland would need an influx of immigrants to balance the books.
Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas bank say the country will not be able to pay pensions because of our ageing population.
It recommends: "Encouraging inward immigration would be essential."
Nats insists border checks will not be needed if Scots vote for a split in September's referendum, with First Minister Alex Salmond saying the "common travel area" would continue.
But MPs claim controls would be unavoidable if thousands of immigrants move to Scotland.
