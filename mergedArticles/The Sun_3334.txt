By KEVIN SCHOFIELD A UKIP-supporting British Asian student has quit the party after accusing it of "deliberately attracting the racist vote".
Sanya-Jeet Thandi, 21 — described by leader Nigel Farage as the "future face of Ukip" — said their recent billboard poster campaign was the last straw.
Londoner Ms Thandi, who was in Ukip's youth wing, said: "The direction in which the party is going is terrifying. Ukip is exploiting the stupidity of ignorant anti-immigrant voters. While the party deliberately attracts the racist vote, I refuse to be associated with them."
