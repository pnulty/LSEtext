Conservative election hopes are being jeopardised by the party's "relentless focus" on immigration, a Tory backbencher has warned while issuing an appeal to David Cameron to stop trying to "out-Ukip Ukip".
Mark Field suggested that the Prime Minister's "undeliverable" pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands was helping fuel a public perception that his party was "fundamentally hostile" to immigrants.
He pointed to "alarming" figures suggesting Polish nationals living in the UK were three times more likely to vote Labour in May's European elections despite being natural Conservative supporters.
Mr Field was speaking at the launch of his Conservatives for a Managed Migration group - which seeks a "moderate, balanced and rational debate".
He denied being a lone voice, despite the failure of Commons colleagues to attend the Westminster meeting in support. "We hope to get more MPs on board," he said.
