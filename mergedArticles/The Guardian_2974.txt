I'm 45 and was born in Cameroon. I'm an economic investigative journalist and now live in Glasgow. Almost a decade ago I fled Cameroon because of revelations about government finances. I was detained and tortured, but with the help of family friends I was able to escape to the UK. I was in the immigration system for seven years, unable to work and threatened with being deported home, where I would almost certainly have been killed. A huge campaign led by NUJ journalists in Glasgow allowed me to remain here. Since being released, I have worked for the Scottish Council and the Community Information Source, which helps asylum seekers.
The Guardian has always been the only newspaper to give a true representation of the circumstances of asylum seekers and refugees. It gives a fair picture of what is happening without accusing individuals of being "scroungers" or "lazy". I find the financial pages really interesting and well-balanced. One of the main things is the Guardian's commitment to freedom of speech and exposing the truth about society - as someone who had this right taken away, I cannot express how important it is.
