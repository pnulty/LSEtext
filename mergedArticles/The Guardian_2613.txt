The Scottish parliament would be given powers to control billions of pounds of income tax and housing benefit under Scottish Labour's plans for greater devolution.
Labour said yesterday Holyrood should be given new rights to set variable rates of income tax - including fixing new higher rates for the wealthiest of at least 50p, raising an additional pounds 100m - and to set its own housing benefit policy.
Labour said the income tax power would allow the Scottish parliament to raise 40% of its own finances, as well as transferring pounds 1.7bn worth of housing benefit to Scotland.
Johann Lamont, the Scottish Labour leader, said Labour had decided not to devolve full powers over all income tax rates because that could leave Scotland more vulnerable in future to economic shocks, currently underwritten by the UK Treasury. "This is the right balance between fiscal accountability and insuring us against risk," she said.
Lamont added: "Our guiding principle was to make Scotland a fairer, more socially just society."
The income tax powers would extend Scotland's forthcoming powers under the Scotland Act 2012 to set its own income tax rates, up to controlling at least 15p in the pound.
Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's deputy first minister, said the new proposals from Labour, and the powers being offered by the Lib Dems and hinted at by the Tories, would fail to give Scotland the powers it needed.
"If we want to have the powers in Scotland that allow us to address the key challenges that we have as a country . . . then we need to have full power over tax, employment, welfare and immigration," Sturgeon said on BBC Radio Scotland. Severin Carrell
