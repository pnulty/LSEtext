A TOP immigration judge has quit after being accused of providing financial support to an illegal immigrant.
Judge Richard McKee, 65, retired last month after a 12-year career dealing with immigration cases. He is reported to be entitled to a pension of at least £50,000 a year.
It emerged today that Judge McKee quit after being challenged by his bosses about giving financial support to a Nigerian woman, Fatimah Umar, who was apparently living at his flat in Kilburn.
Umar, 39, was arrested in January for causing £5,000 of criminal damage at the property, a Scotland Yard spokesman said today. She is serving an eightweek jail term after pleading guilty at Hendon magistrates' court to one count of criminal damage and three of assaulting three police officers.
According to The Sun, Ms Umar was found to have overstayed her UK visa. People found to have "overstayed" normally face deportation.
A Judiciary spokeswoman said: "On January 31 it was brought to the Chamber President's attention that Upper Tribunal Judge McKee was providing financial support to a person who was alleged to be an immigration offender. This was put to Mr McKee who then retired with effect from February 4."
The Office for Judicial Complaints said he had been reprimanded as he had "fallen short of the standards expected of all judicial office holders".
