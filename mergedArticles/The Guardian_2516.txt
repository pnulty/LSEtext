Open warfare has broken out between Vince Cable and Theresa May over immigration with the Liberal Democrat business secretary saying that every time he puts his head "above the parapet" by talking positively about migrants he feels he needs "a reinforced tin hat".
Cable, in a Mansion House speech tonight, is to attack the Tories' net migration target, claims of benefit tourism and concerns over EU migrants, saying: "We just have to stop treating people coming to work here as if they are a problem. We need to kill off all the scare stories."
But new immigration minister James Brokenshire will tonight renew May's weekend rebuke to Cable for suggesting the rapid rise in net migration is good for Britain. He will claim those who benefit from immigration are employers who want cheap labour or the "wealthy metropolitan elite" who want cheap tradesmen or services. He will insist immigration can cause displacement - keeping UK workers out of a job - despite claims that Downing Street is delaying publication of a report showing such effects are overstated.
The clash is the sharpest foretaste yet of the battle on immigration that will take place between the coalition parties before May's European elections. Both sides pre-released parts of their speeches to the media to ensure maximum impact.
The business secretary will acknowledge immigration is deeply unpopular but says: "I am intensely relaxed about people coming to work and study here bringing necessary skills to Britain - provided they pay their taxes and pay their way."
A marked reduction in immigration from the EU would mean an increase in the budget deficit and a slower reduction in public debt, he will say.
