WHITE people are almost twice as likely as other races to have a longterm illness or disability, official figures show.
Some 20 per cent of those with white skin have some form of longstanding condition which limits their lifestyle, the Office for National Statistics reports.
In contrast, only 11 per cent of those belonging to non-white ethnic groups, including categories such as mixed race, black, Asian and people of Chinese descent, are affected.
It is the first time the ONS has compared the health of races in this way. The government body, which based its report on an unreleased survey from 2012, has not offered an explanation for the disparity.
Experts say the figures may be due to other factors. The white population of Britain has a high proportion of older people which could be a 'major factor', said Prof Kennedy Cruickshank of King's College London. He said previous studies had also suggested that newer immigrants to Britain tended to be more private about their health problems when talking to researchers. That may have skewed the results.
The study also suggested the higher a person's income, the less the chance there is of them having a long-standing illness.
It comes after a report on Tuesday by University College London claimed eating more than five pieces of fruit and vegetables a day could help prolong life. Academics have suggested consuming seven portions could improve health, and that even ten helpings could be recommended.
