Employment Minister Esther McVey welcomes the fall in unemployment figures, and reacts to the news that the number of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants working in Britain dipped slightly in the first three months of this year
Jobs growth between January and March rose to a 43-year high, driving down the unemployment rate to its lowest level in more than five years.
The number of people in work rose to 30.43m - a record high - and almost a quarter of million up on the same period last year.
The unemployment rate dipped a tenth of a percentage point to 6.8pc and the number of people out of work in the quarter fell by 133,000 to 2.21m compared with the previous three-month period. At the same point last year unemployment stood at 2.52m.
Self-employment has been a key reason behind both the rise in the number of people in work and the lower jobless rate. Almost one in seven people - some 4.55m - are now self-employed the highest level since records began in 1971. The number of people working for themselves has risen by 375,000 over the past year.
