More than 750 foreign national offenders - including killers, rapists and paedophiles - have absconded while awaiting deportation after being released from detention.
Figures released to the Daily Mail under Freedom of Information laws show serious violent criminals are among those at large, including 11 rapists, child abusers and offenders convicted of manslaughter.
In addition, six burglars, 26 robbers, dozens of violent thugs and 76 drug dealers are on the list of foreign criminals who have escaped bail after release from prison or immigration detention.
Of the 752 never to be found, 16 have been on the run for more than 10 years, and 158 for between five and 10 years.
Another 310 have been on the run for between two and five years, while 191 have been at large for between one and two years, and 77 for less than a year.
The Home Office removed or deported a total of 4,589 foreign national offenders in 2012.
This included more than 60 individuals found guilty of murder, attempted murder or causing death, approximately 385 sex offenders, and approximately 1,200 drug offenders.
A Home Office spokesman said: " We believe foreign nationals who break our rules should be removed from the UK at earliest opportunity. Last year we removed more than 4,500 foreign national offenders.
"Where individuals abscond from our controls, we work closely with the police and probation services and employ specialist trace and locate teams to return these individuals to prison.
"Absconders are circulated on the Police National Computer and are added to our watch lists in case those who have left the country seek to re-enter.
"The Immigration Bill will also make it harder for foreign criminals to frustrate their removal through repeat or late bail applications by restricting how often they can apply without a change in circumstance."
