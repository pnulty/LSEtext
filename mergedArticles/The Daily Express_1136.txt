ONE in three people in Britain will be from an ethnic minority by the middle of the century, a report forecasts today.
It will rocket from the current figure of eight per cent to as much as 30 per cent – a total of 23 million – over the next 40 years, it said.
The report also reveals that more black and Asian families will move out of inner–city areas.
The study by influential think–tank Policy Exchange lays bare the effect of decades of immigration and reveals the huge impact of Labour's open door policy to migrants between 1997 and 2010.
It also supports previous studies which have shown Britain will be the Western world's most ethnically diverse nation after 2050.
The report reveals that the population from the five largest distinct black and minority ethnic communities could rocket from eight million to 23 million people by 2051.
By then the UK's population is forecast to hit 77 million.
The report, A Portrait of Modern Britain, draws on an extensive set of survey, census, academic and polling data to build up a detailed picture of the five largest minority groups in the UK – Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, black Africans and black Caribbeans.
It reveals that black Africans and Bangladeshis are the fastest growing of Britain's ethnic minorities.
The study also shows that while Britain has changed and is continuing to become even more multi–racial, people from ethnic minority backgrounds have a far stronger association with being British than the white population.
In 2011, only 14 per cent of whites identified themselves as being purely 1 in 3 children at state–funded British. All other ethnic minority communities were more than four times more likely to associate themselves with being British.
Some 71 per cent of Bangladeshis and 63 per cent of Pakistanis considered themselves purely British. Fifty–five per cent of the black Caribbean community see themselves as just British.
Rishi Sunak, co–author of the report, said: "The face of Britain has changed and will keep changing over schools is from an ethnic minority the next 30 years. From the post–war arrival of Jamaicans and Indians to the recent influx of Africans, the UK is now home to a melting pot of different cultures and traditions.
"These communities will continue to become an ever more significant part of Britain, especially in future elections."
The think–tank says that currently voters from ethnic groups overwhelmingly identify with and vote for the Labour Party. Last month Adam Afriyie, the first black Tory MP and once touted as a future party leader, said the Conservatives will not be able to completely detoxify its brand in the eyes of ethnic minority voters in time for next year's general election.
He admitted that even if Prime Minister David Cameron "does everything perfectly" in the run up to the 2015 general election, the party's lack of support among minorities will persist.
