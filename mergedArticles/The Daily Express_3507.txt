Yes AT last, someone in authority showing a bit of pride in this great country of ours as Bolton council urges schools to fly the flag and sing the National Anthem ("Fly the Union flag, schools told", April 18).
Bolton Tory councillor Mudasir Dean is correct when he says our flag has, in the past, been hijacked by the far Right and it should be brought back into mainstream life.
The best thing about the World Cup this summer will be the England flags fluttering outside millions of homes, pubs and offices, right up until the day that England crash out on penalties again.
Robbie Marley, Lancaster No IT is all well and good for Bolton Council to tell schools to sing the National Anthem and fly the Union flag to promote some national pride and help immigrants integrate into British life.
But it all sounds like a bit of a token effort to me.
Schools could do a lot more to promote Britishness and help foreign visitors feel more welcome in a way that doesn't begin and end with a flag and a song.
Playing sport is a great way of including as many people as possible, as is learning about our popular culture.
