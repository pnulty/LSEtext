Chancellor Angela Merkel 's government is considering limiting the right of unemployed migrants from other EU states to remain in Germany and tightening access to welfare benefits under plans that echo the crackdown proposed last year by British counterpart David Cameron.
Berlin's proposals could give fresh impetus to Mr Cameron's hopes of securing EU-wide support for tougher rules on intra-EU immigration and welfare abuse with Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands also voicing concerns.
But the German plans, set out in an interim government report published yesterday, are accompanied by a staunch defence of EU rights to freedom of movement and the economic advantages of immigration, so the scope for a genuine rapprochement between Berlin and London on one of the thorniest issues in EU politics may be limited.
Thomas de Maizi√®re, the interior minister, said problems of welfare abuse were "manageable at a national level but of concern regionally", referring to the concentrations of poor jobless immigrants in big cities, notably in the depressed Ruhr region.
The report, to be finalised in June, proposes that migrants abusing freedom of movement should not be allowed to return to Germany for a set period, which is yet to be defined.
The report says no restrictions are placed on an EU citizen's right to look for work in other EU states.
But "after a set time, the question arises whether the job hunt can have the prospect of success".
