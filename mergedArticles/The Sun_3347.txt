ED Miliband yesterday trashed Labour's immigration record — and insisted he WAS concerned about protecting our borders.
He said his predecessors as leader had "too often dismissed people's concerns" about immigration. And he gave the clearest sign yet that Labour would keep a cap on non-EU migrants if they win the 2015 election.
Mr Miliband said: "We have got to reduce the pool of low-skilled migration into the UK."
Speaking in Wales, Mr Miliband added: "I am never going to tell you that Britain should turn its back on the world. It just won't work.
"But I am not going to tell you either, nor should Labour ever tell you, we should ignore people's concerns about immigration."
