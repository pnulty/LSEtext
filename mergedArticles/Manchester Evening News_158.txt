NIGEL Farage emerged on top after a bitter faceoff with Nick Clegg which saw them brand each other liars and fantasists, according to a poll.
A snap YouGov survey suggested 68 per cent thought the Ukip leader had performed best in their second televised debate, compared to 27pc who favoured the Deputy Prime Minister.
The verdict followed an hour of increasingly badtempered exchanges, with Mr Clegg repeatedly accusing his opponent of 'fantasy'.
He also picked up Mr Farage for 'indefensible' comments in which he suggested he admired Russian president Vladimir Putin for outwitting the EU.
Mr Farage said the Liberal Democrat leader was 'wilfully lying' about how many laws were imposed on the UK by the EU. Mr Farage said that immigration had left the 'white working-class effectively as an underclass'.
