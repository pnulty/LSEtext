Two police officers turned up at the home of a blogger to interview him about a series of tweets that highlighted the UK Independence Party's controversial policies on the NHS, tax and immigration.
Michael Abberton, a Green Party member, was visited at his Cambridgeshire home by two officers on Saturday after a series of tweets in which he claimed to be verifying the truth of Ukip's election claims.
Mr Abberton had posted a mockedup Ukip election poster claiming, among other things, that the party would scrap paid maternity leave, cut education spending to buy three new aircraft carriers and make it legal for a man to rape or assault his wife.
All the supposed "pledges" were sourced to public statements by the party, the voting record of their MEP or by comments from senior Ukip figures. But the poster upset a Ukip councillor who complained to police, and they decided to interview Mr Abberton at his home.
Writing on his blog, Mr Abberton described the incident - and claimed the officers told him that he should not publicise the visit.
"They said [the visit] was in relation to a complaint that had been made by a certain political party in relation to tweets I had published about them and one tweet in particular which talked about 10 reasons to vote for them," he added.
Mr Abberton said the officers "were extremely professional and polite" but he said after they left he was concerned that the visit had taken place at all. A Cambridgeshire Police spokesman confirmed the visit but said they had not told Mr Abberton to delete the tweets.
The Representation of the People Act forbids the publishing of false statements about candidates ahead of any poll.
