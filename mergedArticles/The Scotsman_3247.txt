NEW immigration figures have revealed the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK has fallen - despite claims from some politicians that levels would surge with the lifting of work restrictions.
A total of 140,000 citizens from the two eastern European countries were in employment between January and March, a drop of 4,000 compared to the last three months of 2013.
There had been warnings from some quarters, including Ukip, that the lifting of curbs on immigration from the so-called "A2" countries would see an influx of migrant workers.
The numbers predicted to come to the UK varied greatly, with some claiming that up to 50,000 people a year could pour into the country, bringing with them an increase in street crime.
At the turn of the year, claims of fully booked airline flights and packed coaches from Bucharest and Sofia heading for the UK also proved to be false.
