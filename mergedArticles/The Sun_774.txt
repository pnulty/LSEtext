I CONGRATULATE Sun columnist Katie Hopkins, below, for her outspoken views on Channel 5's Big Immigration Row Live debate.
What a gutsy lady. I totally agreed with everything she said.
If we had another war with conscription, how many of our foreign guests would leave shouting: "We are not British"? Well done, Katie.
TOM EASTWOOD Sevenoaks, Kent I AGREED with everything Katie Hopkins said on that farce of a programme The Big Immigration Row Live. The hand-picked rabble of an audience was a disgrace.
JIM BURNS Altrincham, Cheshire I WAS disgusted that the debate was so onesided. The majority of the audience were of foreign origin. Katie Hopkins, pictured, was the only panellist who stuck up for the majority of British people.
LES KOZAK Norwich KATIE HOPKINS' outpourings and extremely muddled thinking really have no place anywhere. Who wants to hear all that vitriol spouted? WENDY WALKER Luton
