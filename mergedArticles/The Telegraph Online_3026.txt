Poland enters top ten destinations for travellers from Britain – but just one in five of them are tourists
Polish immigrants travelling home to visit family have helped push their country into the top ten foreign destinations for British residents, ONS figures show .
For the first time Poland appears alongside Spain, France and the USA on the list of the ten nations with the most visitors from Britain, with 1.7 million visits made last year.
But while most of the countries in the top ten are principally visited by tourists, some 70 per cent of visits to Poland were made by people visiting family and friends. In contrast just 20 per cent visited the country as tourists and seven per cent on business.
Poland was also among the top ten sources of visitors last year, with 1.4 million arriving in the UK. Four in ten came to Britain to visit friends and family and 42 per cent came for business, while just 14 per cent were on holiday.
The French made the most visits to Britain last year, with 3.9 million crossing the channel but they were only the 37th most generous, spending an average of just £71 per day.
In contrast visitors form the Middle East were the most lavish spenders, parting with an average of £173 each day.
In total there were 33 million visits to Britain by visitors from all countries, more than ever before, who spent a record £21 billion in the county.
There was a 0.3 per cent decline in visits from the USA, but travel to the UK from Europe and the rest of the world increased by 5.7 per cent and 9.3 per cent respectively.
