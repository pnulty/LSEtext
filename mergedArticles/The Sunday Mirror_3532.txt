FOUR immigrants were last night in hospital after trying to swim to UK-bound boats moored in Calais harbour.
The men have hypothermia after three were plucked from the sea. The other man got into trouble in deep water but managed to get to shore himself.
Fishermen told the authorities after spotting the men clutching waterproof bundles full of food during high tide early on Friday.
French police said: "The idea was to swim out to the ferries so as to avoid customs and other checks. Port patrol cars were on the quay alongside them within minutes." It comes after it emerged four men died in just one week last month trying to board lorries to the UK.
