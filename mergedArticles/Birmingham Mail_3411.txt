AN illegal immigrant living in Birmingham who tried to get a fake ID card to allow him to work has been jailed for eight months.
Grenald Bregu, 25, of Constitution Hill, Hockley, admitted conspiracy to control a bogus identity document.
Jason Pegg, prosecuting at Birmingham Crown Court, said Bregu was an Albanian who came to the UK in 2008 on a student visa. However when he made an application for the visa to be renewed the following year it was refused.
He said Bregu was warned about his status when he returned to Albania last year but later came back to the UK in a lorry after staying in a camp in Calais.
The matter came to light when Metropolitan police detained another man and he was found to be in possession of a fake card in Bregu's name.
Mr Pegg said there was evidence of text traffic between the two men.
