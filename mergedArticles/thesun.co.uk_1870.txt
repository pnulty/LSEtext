The campaigning backbencher added that anti-EU party had done Conservatives a favour by “cleansing" them of people with abhorrent views.
The Jewish MP told House magazine: “To me there are two kinds of UKIP. The Godfrey Bloom guy who’s like a cross between Sid James and Bernard Manning.
“And then there’s a more sinister element, like the MEP who said every Muslim has got to sign a declaration of non-violence.
“That to me is literally akin to Nazis saying Jews should wear a yellow star. I genuinely find it abhorrent and frightening."
UKIP leader Nigel Farage immediately branded the comments “hysterical slurs" - and said party members would hold a day of action in Mr Halfon’s Harlow constituency.
Gerard Batten, UKIP’s immigration spokesman, called for Muslims to sign a non-violence charter last month - as well as demanding a ban on new mosques.
Mr Halfon’s comments come as polls predict UKIP could WIN May’s European Elections.
Mr Farage said: “Mr Halfon’s hysterical slurs are the result of a growing Tory terror of UKIP’s rising popularity all over the country."
