Nigel Farage repeatedly refused to apologise yesterday for saying he would be worried if a group of Romanians moved in next door as rival MPs accused him of racism.
Ukip took out a full-page advert in The Daily Telegraph to insist that it was not a racist party as the fallout from Mr Farage's interview with James O'Brien on LBC Radio last week continued.
The Ukip leader was asked four times in an interview with the BBC to apologise for the comments - which were compared to "no blacks, no Irish" signs in 1950s' Britain - but did not change his stance until asked a fifth time, when he said: "If I gave the impression in that interview that I was discriminating against Romanians then I apologise certainly for that.
"I do not wish for people to feel in a discriminatory manner towards Romanians but I do say there is a very real problem here, that everybody else has run away from, brushed under the carpet, the whole organised crime element and the impact that has had on London and other parts of the country. That is a serious issue."
David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham in north London, said his parents had arrived in the UK as immigrants. "I remember a context in which some people said you don't want these people living next to you. That was racist," he said. "What Nigel Farage said over the weekend was racist, so I'm clear, he's a racist."
The Labour MP, Dianne Abbott, told Channel 4 News that Mr Farage was using a "very chilling and classically-racist line".
A ComRes survey found that 31 per cent of theose surveyed thought Mr Farage was "weird", compared with 23 per cent for Ed Miliband, and 7 per cent for David Cameron.
