Says..
POLITICIANS are making immigration their key issue but the problem won't go away.
In fact it's getting worse. The latest figures show that more than half a million migrants are planning to come to our shores in the next five years.
That's enough to fill a city the size of Manchester.
There are scores of examples of how a diverse population is a positive thing for this country.
But there has to be a point when there are simply too many people living here.
Our schools, hospitals and prisons are already packed to the rafters.
The Government needs to make good on its promises and turn the corner now.
