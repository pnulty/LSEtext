The prime minister's wife, Samantha Cameron, was named on a successful application for British citizenship by the family's nanny, who is of Nepalese origin, Downing Street confirmed last night.
As Labour called for complete transparency, Downing Street issued a statement saying Gita Lima had been awarded citizenship after David Cameron became prime minister in 2010. His wife did not endorse her application but was named as her employer in line with the normal procedure for such applications.
No 10 said: "Mr and Mrs Cameron's nanny became a British citizen in late 2010. Mr and Mrs Cameron did not write a letter supporting their nanny's application for British citizenship. The normal application process was followed throughout. As is usual, Mrs Cameron was named on her application as her employer."
The news that the prime minister's wife was named on the document, months after Cameron pledged to cap the number of non-EU immigrants, came as an embarrassment to No 10. Tory ministers who employ immigrants as nannies have been mocked after James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, highlighted the way in which the "wealthy metropolitan elite" rely on cheap labour from overseas.
Phil Wilson, the Labour MP for Sedgefield, said: " There must now be complete transparency and openness from the prime minister over any contact between him, his office and the Home Office regarding his family's nanny."
The focus on the nanny angered Downing Street. Lima is regarded with great affection by the Camerons for her sensitivity towards their late son, Ivan, who was severely disabled. Sources said Lima came to Britain as part of a scheme to help victims of domestic slavery.
