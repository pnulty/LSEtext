CATHEINE LILLINGTON PASSENGERS arriving at Birmingham Airport were last night caught up in lengthy queues after an IT glitch hit border force computers.
It was one of a number of UK airports disrupted by the fault which saw extra staff drafted in.
A Birmingham Airport spokesman said: "We are aware [of the glitch] and the impact it is having at the moment.
"It appears to be getting progressively worse but we are hoping it will be sorted out soon."
A Border Force spokesman said: "We are currently experiencing temporary IT problems which may add to the time taken to conduct passport checks.
"We are working to rectify this issue and are providing extra staff to get passengers through the controls as quickly as possible. Our priority remains security of the border.
"We apologise for any additional time this adds to passengers' journeys."
Passengers across the country reported problems at passport control desks, mostly affecting those trying to enter the country.
The problem is having a particular impact on non-EU airline customers.
A Heathrow spokesman said: "There are some longer queues than normal in the terminals, but we have spoken to border force and they are putting on extra staff.
"Obviously we want to sort the issue out but not risk the integrity of the border controls."
A Gatwick spokesman added: "We are experiencing similar (problems) to the rest of the airports, and we are working to get people through.
"People should be able to get off the plane, it is those coming through the immigration process which it is frustrating."
The spokesman said there should not be any delays to flights leaving UK airports.
