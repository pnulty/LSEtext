Nick Clegg should never have challenged UKIP leader Nigel Farage to a debate, Lord Heseltine has said.
The former Deputy Prime Minister dismissed the party as a "protest group" and said Mr Clegg should not entertain it.
Mr Clegg invited Mr Farage last week to a debate over Britain's membership of the EU. "I wouldn't do it if I was him [Mr Clegg]," said Lord Heseltine. "I think that it's a misjudgment, frankly, to equate the leadership of a party which is part of Government with a protest group ... more about immigration than it is about Europe."
Speaking on Sky News' Murnaghan programme, he dismissed UKIP as "isolationist". The Tory peer likened it to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during the 1980s.
He said: "CND was seen as an allconquering protest group. They had one of the biggest demonstrations in London of all time ... and that was in early 1983.
"A few months later in the general election of '83, the existence of CND and the damning relationship of that with the Labour Party enabled us to have a massive victory.
"We have never been isolated from Europe, our politics have always been absolutely interwoven with Europe."
His comments came as Simon Hughes, former deputy leader of the Lib Dems, admitted that Mr Clegg would have his work cut out in the debate, set to take place next month.
He said: "It will be a tough gig, and he knows that, and Nigel is a difficult opponent, but Nick has never been afraid."
Nigel Farage's attempts to broaden support for UKIP have received a boost with a donation from Sir Tim Rice, the lyricist behind of West End hits Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar, who is understood to have given £7,500.
