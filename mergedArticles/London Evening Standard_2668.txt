THE WRITER of a new play about the experience of Romanians in the UK hopes it will challenge the negative stereotype.
Carla Grauls, pictured, a Belgian South African who has lived in London for eight years, said Occupied was based on her own experience of living in Romania, where she met people interested in moving here to work â€” but few who knew anything about the welfare system. "Coming back here to the view that people were coming over for benefits was quite surprising," said Grauls, 34, who lives in Hornsey.
The play is a dark comedy in which two Romanian immigrants, driven by a desire for belonging, kidnap an Englishman in order to learn how to be English.
Occupied previews from April 1 and runs until April 26 at Theatre503 at the Latchmere Pub in Battersea.
