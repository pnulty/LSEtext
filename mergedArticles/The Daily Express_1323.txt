TROUBLED support services group Serco has turned to the grandson of wartime Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill to inspire a revival.
Its reputation and financial performance have been shredded by the offender tagging scandal.
Serco, whose contracts include immigration control and managing the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment, has made Aggreko boss Rupert Soames its chief executive from June 1. Soames, 54, brother of former Tory minister Nicholas Soames, gets a £255,000 pension and is eligible for a bonus of up to 150 per cent of his £850,000 salary plus shares worth double that subject to performance.
He was at the helm of £4billion FTSE 100 power supplier Aggreko for 11 years and joins an outfit with a market value half its size. Former boss Chris Hyman quit after it was accused of over-charging on contracts to tag criminals that led to a UK Government ban on new work.
Soames said: "The work that Serco does is important to the lives of millions of people and I believe we can find a way through to a bright future."
Aggreko chairman Ken Hanna described Soames as "a charismatic leader of men, very politically astute, with good strategic insight and leadership skills".
Shore Capital analyst Robin Speakman said: "We believe that Serco's reputation with clients and decision makers has just gone up two notches on the dial from zero. Mr Soames will be a very busy man for the next few years."
Serco shares rose 49¾p to 460½p, while those of Aggreko fell 70p to 1560p.
