British families should follow the example set by African and Asian immigrants and look after their elderly relatives rather than send them to care homes, the justice minister has said (Fariha Karim writes).
Simon Hughes said that although taking responsibility for older relatives would mean "sacrifice", it was ultimately a "much more civilised way to proceed". He said that too many old people in Britain were suffering a "much less happy ending" to their lives than they should because they were neglected.
"I think we need to learn better the lessons of other cultures and communities, of which the Asian and African communities are noticeable," he told The Daily Telegraph. "They understand the obligation to look after your family to the end. If we had a society in which we collectively take responsibility for our families, I think we would see fewer people dependent on the state."
Last year figures suggested that 46 per cent of people aged over 80 felt lonely. There were 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, most of which involved over-65s.
Mr Hughes said: "Our society has often left too many people who are the responsibility of the public services on their own in later life, even though they have family alive."
