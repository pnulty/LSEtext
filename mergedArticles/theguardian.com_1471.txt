First three Zeppelin albums will feature songs never officially released in any form
For a band who broke up 34 years ago this September, Led Zeppelin know how to keep busy. Fresh from winning the Grammy award for best rock album in January – for Celebration Day, the live recording of their 2007 reunion concert at the O2 Arena in London – they have announced a series of reissues. But what will excite fans most is that the new versions of their first three albums will be accompanied by the first previously unreleased Zeppelin recordings since Coda, the album of studio outtakes they issued in 1982.
Four songs unheard by fans except on bootlegs will appear on companion discs to the three albums, accompanied by alternate versions of songs from the official releases and backing tracks. The new song La La will appear on the second disc of Led Zeppelin II, while Led Zeppelin III features Jennings Farm Blues, an instrumental forerunner to Bron-Y-Aur Stomp, Bathroom Sound (which would become Out on the Tiles) and a song that merges two blues standards, Keys to the Highway/Trouble in Mind.
"The material on the companion discs presents a portal to the time of the recording of Led Zeppelin," said guitarist Jimmy Page. "It is a selection of work in progress with rough mixes, backing tracks, alternate versions and new material recorded at the time."
The reissues, due out on 2 June, kick off a long-promised revamp of the Zeppelin catalogue – Page first spoke of them in 2012. Last year, singer Robert Plant said he had found unreleased recordings; it is not known if any of these appear on the new releases. "I found some quarter-inch spools recently, and I had a meeting with Jimmy [Page], and we baked them up and listened to them," he told BBC Radio 6 Music. "There's some very, very interesting bits and pieces that probably will turn up on these things."
Here is a full tracklist for all the reissues:
