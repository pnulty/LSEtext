Ukip's small business spokesman faced claims of hypocrisy after it emerged that seven people were arrested for immigration offences in a raid on his restaurant.
The authorities raided the Manchester restaurant, set up by Ukip European election candidate Amjad Bashir with his two sons Tayub and Mudassar, on 1 June last year, The Times reported.
The family have denied any wrongdoing and party leader Nigel Farage said they are appealing and he was not going to "prejudge" the case.
The newspaper said three days after the raid Mr Bashir (right) resigned as a director of the company which owns the Zouk Tea Bar and Grill, and a sister branch in Bradford, but has continued to take a role in the restaurant.
Mr Bashir, 61, is second on Ukip's list of candidates for the Yorkshire and the Humber region in this month's European elections.
The Home Office confirmed seven people were arrested "for a variety of immigration offences". Tayub Bashir vigorously denied any wrongdoing.
