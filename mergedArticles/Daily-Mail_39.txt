FRANCES Socialist government was plunged into further crisis yesterday following massive gains for the far-Right in local elections.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of anti-immigration and anti-Europe party the Front National, described the results as a huge breakthrough in the fight against the corruption and apathy of mainstream parties. The FN won outright in the former coal-mining town of Henin-Beaumont in a first-round vote on Sunday, and leads in at least six other towns.
President Francois Hollandes Socialists and their allies won just 38 per cent of the national vote, behind 47 per cent for opposition conservatives, initial tallies showed. The president has seen his popularity slump to record lows for failing to rein in unemployment.
The FN won around 5 per cent " a proportionately high amount given that it fielded candidates in just 600 of 36,000 constituencies. Miss Le Pen said: The Front National is taking root just as it wanted to do " and the crop is pretty exceptional.
Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault urged voters to back whatever candidate was best placed to beat FN rivals in Sundays second round.
