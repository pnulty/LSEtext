A SCHOOLBOY from London's impoverished East End will follow in the footsteps of 19 prime ministers, including David Cameron, after winning a place at Eton.
Ishak Ayiris, 15, the son of an Ethiopian immigrant, lives on a council estate.
In September, he will start studying politics, philosophy and economics at the private school's sixth form. Ishak, a student at the Forest Gate Community School, earned the position through the pupil premium — a scheme that helps children from deprived backgrounds.
Ishak said his family was delighted that he had won the £76,000 two–year scholarship but they were sorry that he would be away from them. "Leaving will be hard for my family," he said. "Not so much for me. Windsor is much quieter than Newham. Newham is loud, vibrant. Drugs and crime have a big impact on our community.
"The people who live here, who were born here, know this area, they know the situation, they know the problems and they are the best people to solve these problems." The teenager plans to get a place at Oxford before pursuing a career in politics. He said his father was particularly proud of him.
"When my dad found out, he said he had two dreams — coming to England and for his son to go to the same school as the Prime Minister. Both of these dreams have come true." Ishak credits the dedication of his head teacher, Simon Elliot, for giving him the confidence to apply to Eton. "He talks to us not like we are pupils but as equals," he said.
Two other pupils at the school, Irfan Badshah and Alexis Marinoiu, both 15, have also won scholarships to leading public schools.
Mr Elliot credited the pupil premium for his students' success.
