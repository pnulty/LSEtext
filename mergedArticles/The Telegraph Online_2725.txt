A few clicks of the mouse reveal fascinating information about global migration over a 20 year period, thanks to a research project conducted by two expats
An interactive graph showing the global flow of people between countries has been published for the first time.
It shows that on average, 0.6 per cent of the world population switches their country of residence over the course of a five-year period.
Guy Abel, from the UK, and Nikola Sander, from Germany, who are researchers from the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Human Capital in Vienna, produced the graph.
Unlike previous research projects, which tend to list the number of people living outside of their country of birth, this one aimed to detail visually the intensity and pattern of global migration flows.
The researchers created a circular and colour coded migration graphic, developed using a software pattern widely used in genetics, to show the complex and dynamic nature of migration.
It details information for 196 countries around the globe, broken down into continents and regions, showing the origin and destinations of migrants. The figures are based on estimates stemming from United Nations information. They cover the period 1990-2010.
The data indicated that people from individual African countries tended to move within the continent, whereas people from Europe tended to move to very diverse locations.
The figures also show that the largest migration movements occured between south and west Asia, from Latin to North America, and within Africa.
The research illustrated how more developed regions tended to record net migration gains, whereas less developed countries sent more migrants than they received.
Dr Sander and Dr Abel said: "It appears that most of the largest flows originated in Asia and went to the oil-rich Gulf countries and the United States.
"Exceptions to this trend are the flow from Mexico to the United States and flows within Africa (Côte d’Ivoire to Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe to South Africa).
"Malaysia and India were the only countries to be both receivers and senders of very large flows, highlighting the strong effect that migration and differentials in education levels have on the redistribution of population."
Britain did not feature in the top 20 countries for immigration flow in or out. Over the period 2005-2010, 1.62 million flowed into Britain and 640,000 people left for other places.
Of those who left, 136,846 people went to Spain, 116,490 to Africa, 97,875 to Oceania (Australia and New Zealand) and 57,964 to Ireland.
The researchers were surprised during the data gathering process to discover that there was a decline in the number of people around the world who changed their country of residence in the period 1990-2000. This, they said, was “contrary to common belief” that there had been a continuous increase in migration flows.
"According to our estimates, the volume of global migration flows declined from 41.4 million (0.75 per cent of the world population) during 1990 to 1995, to 34.2 million (0.57 per cent of world population) during 1995 to 2000," they said.
They believe that a substantial part of the fall might be due to a reduction in the number of refugees crossing borders as a result of the violent conflicts in Rwanda and the Soviet regime in Afghanistan.
There was an increase in the number of the world’s citizens crossing borders to live in a new country in the first 10 years of the new century, however.
"The number of global movements increased by 5.7 million between 1995–2000 and 2000–2005, and by 1.6 million between 2000–2005 and 2005–2010," said the researchers.
Dr Abel, who is originally from Newbury, Berkshire, England, hopes population forecasters and migration experts will make use of the new interpretation of the data to aid their work.
"It could help them to understand it better and when they do their forecasts it gives them a larger range of data," he said.
