A dramatic growth in the country's elderly population is forecast over the next 25 years, in statistics published by National Records of Scotland.
The trend, likely to put an enormous strain on health and care services, is particularly marked in the over-75 age group, which is expected to rise 86 per cent. The total population over 65 is projected to increase at 26.7 per cent.
Elderly people as a proportion of the population will also rise steeply with the total number of people living in Scotland projected to rise by only 9 per cent by 2037. The working-age population is projected to fall in seven out of 14 NHS board areas.
The statistics were published against a background of an argument over the financing of the pension system in an the Scottish government said: "The increase in the Scottish dependency ratio over time is largely driven by slower growth in the working-age population. Scotland's main challenge is how to increase our working-age population as a share of the overall population."
Its study suggested that a more liberal immigration policy would help finance the pension system.
Last month. Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister said: "It is better for everyone that Britain's faster-rising working-age population, rather than Scotland's slow-rising workingage population covers the cost of the rising numbers of elderly in Scotland.
"If the SNP deny there is a problem they have to explain why they have set up a working party on 'the affordability' of future pensions."
