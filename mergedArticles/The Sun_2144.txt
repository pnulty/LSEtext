THE gran who brought down Gordon Brown has branded Ed Miliband a privileged posh boy.
Gillian Duffy, who Brown called a "bigoted woman" for asking about immigration before his 2010 election loss, said Mr Miliband had never experienced real life.
In a stark blast, lifelong Labour voter Mrs Duffy, 69, said of the three main party leaders: "They're all privileged. They've got a life which revolves around Westminster. Miliband was in with Gordon Brown, he was his helper."
Mrs Duffy also said locals in her hometown of Rochdale, Gtr Manchester, barely knew who Ed was.
She said UKIP leader Mr Farage was a "character", adding: "I think you've got to have characters in politics. He likes a good pint and a smoke."
