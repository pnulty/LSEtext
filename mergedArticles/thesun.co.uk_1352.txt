Capita was handed 196,200 cases by the Home Office in a payment-by-results deal worth up to £40million.
From October 2012-13 it failed to trace a quarter.
Around 83,400 had a barrier to deportation — due to an appeal, family reasons or objection from a home nation.
Another 34,500 had already left and 33,100 had yet to be dealt with.
But the total has since fallen, from 193,881 last June to 182,251 by the end of September.
Capita, whose ongoing deal was unveiled by UK Border Agency chief Rob Whiteman, said: “We have met and in some cases exceeded requirements."
The Home Office added: “Non-EU migration has been cut to its lowest level since 1998."
