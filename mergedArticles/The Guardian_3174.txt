The number of eastern European immigrants coming to Britain was hugely underestimated because an official survey failed to monitor many new arrivals at regional airports, the statistics watchdog has said.
In an admission likely to play into the hands of Ukip, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said net immigration was 346,000 higher than previously thought between 2001 and 2011 because surveys missed a substantial number of passengers.
The news will be a blow to the attempts of Theresa May, the home secretary, and David Cameron to get net immigration down to tens of thousands, rather than hundreds of thousands, as critics say they are now being shown to have started from a higher base.
Asked about the figures, the prime minister's official spokesman said Cameron had confidence in the ONS, but added: "What the latest ONS statistics underline is the point at which, in the 2000s, immigration was out of control."
Sir Andrew Green, chairman and founder of the campaigning organisation Migration Watch, said: "This is final confirmation that net foreign migration under Labour totals nearly 4 million, two thirds from outside the European Union. It also shows that the peak of net migration was nearly 275,000 a year, making it even more difficult for the present government to get the numbers down to tens of thousands."
Between 2001 and 2007, the number of routes connecting UK airports with airports in EU countries increased from 30 to 190. The largest increases in routes and passenger journeys were at Luton and Stansted airports, with smaller increases recorded at Doncaster, Sheffield, Southampton and Bournemouth. Officials concentrated on monitoring migration at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester.
"Many of these routes were not covered, or not fully covered, by the IPS [Identity and Passport Service] for migration purposes prior to 2009," said the ONS.
Since 2008, more regional airports have been included in surveys.
The highest additional number of migrants was for 2006, when net migration is now thought to have been 67,000 higher than previously recorded, reaching 265,000.
Carlos Vargas Silva, senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said: "We have known for some time that net migration must have been much higher during the 2001 to 2011 period than the official estimates had suggested. This report provides important evidence of the need for better migration data and of the limitations of using a survey to develop net migration data."
The ONS has conducted a review of the quality of long-term international migration estimates over the decade 2001-11. That review followed research after the 2011 census for England and Wales, which found that the census-based mid-year population estimate was 464,000 higher than the mid-year estimates rolled forward from 2001.
The biggest factor for the discrepancy was an underestimate of long-term immigration from eastern and central Europe.
An ONS spokesman said: "ONS recognised with the publication of 2011 census data that the IPS had underestimated migration between 2001-11.
We published revised overall net migration figures in 2013, and the data published today update the historical series to make it consistent with those. All that the data published today allow that previous publications did not is to find individual calendar year totals for 2001-11."
Cameron has said he wants to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next general election. Rules limiting out-of-work benefits for migrants from EU countries would be extended to child welfare payments, the government announced yesterday.
