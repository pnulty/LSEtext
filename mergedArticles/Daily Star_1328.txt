UKIP leader Nigel Farage blasted Britain yesterday saying it was "unfit to pass to our children".
He claimed the UK had lost control of its borders in an attack on the Coalition's open-door immigration policy.
Farage, 49, also berated the Government for its response to the flood crisis.
He called for a public inquiry to review the Environment Agency, which he slammed for favouring "molluscs and beetles" over "farmers and householders".
In a rallying cry ahead of the European and local elections on May 22, Farage said: "Together we can get our country back."
Speaking at the party's spring conference in Torquay, Devon, he said: "Some 80% of us in this country believe opendoor immigration is irresponsible and that it must stop.
"We have seen since 2004 a doubling of youth unemployment. We have seen wage compression - people taking home less money than 10 years ago.
"This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."
