IT IS very easy to have a go at Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.
Indeed, last week the Labour party, bizarrely, decided to devote its entire party political broadcast to belittling him, seeking to portray him as a bullied, put upon wimp who is routinely ignored by Coalition Cabinet colleagues.
Never mind that top of most sane people’s worry list is the economy, jobs, immigration, national security or the state of the health service, Labour lavished a considerable sum to send up Nick Clegg in a film that was humourless, pointless and left most people feeling they could not care less.
As someone in the media who probably knows Mr Clegg as well as anyone I can assure you he is too robust and steadfast for this to have fazed him for even a heartbeat.
However, what desperately does require more scrutiny is his avowed intent to block Conservative plans for a crackdown on knife crime.
This was promised in David Cameron’s manifesto in 2010 but was another victim of the fact that the Tories managed to blast the ball over the bar in front of the empty goal of that general election and needed a coalition with the Lib Dems to get into power.
In truth, the commentators and political chatterati have been deeply dismayed by how little the Coalition has fought and how well, in most areas, it has performed.
Hence they seize on any bit of discord and treat it as if it were fisticuffs across the Cabinet table.
This bold stance by Clegg could be the one, however, that causes a good old-fashioned rumpus and possibly demonstrates that despite taking all the calls we have done together down the months, he might not always have been listening.
Partly spurred on by the stabbing to death of a teacher in her classroom, the Conservatives want to introduce automatic jail terms for repeat knife offenders, a “two strikes and you’re in” kind of policy but Clegg is adamantly against it.
He dismisses it as an attempt to introduce “headline-grabbing solutions” in the wake of the killing of Ann Maguire.
He goes on to claim it could “turn the young offenders of today into the hardened criminals of tomorrow” and calls it “a backwards step that will undermine the Government’s rehabilitation revolution”.
This is high stakes stuff for Mr Clegg and if, as is being mooted, the Labour party opts to support the Conservatives, at a time when the Lib Dems’ poll ratings are bouncing on the bottom and in one case they are being beaten even by the Green Party, Clegg’s party risks being stranded on a political peninsula.
Clegg is a shrewd strategist and is that rare politician who usually actually stands by his beliefs, however unpopular they might be.
As the calls came in last week, he did not move an inch on his trenchant opposition, even if his rather convoluted argument “it could mean an electrician could be sent to prison for going to work with a penknife” seemed as big a stretch as you are ever likely to witness outside of a gymnast’s workout.
The likelihood of the Crown Prosecution Service seeking such a conviction could best be described as remote.
Experts in the field support the move.
Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said it was time for “a proper and objective look at youth sentencing... in controlling the use of knives.”
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe agreed and pointed out it has worked extremely well in controlling the use of guns as everyone knows they will get a minimum of five years inside.
Sir Bernard added that there is every reason it would work equally well in combating the problem of knives.
If Clegg’s opposition is a principled stance it is to be admired but in no way whatsoever does that detract from the fact that he could very well be incorrect and surely in an area as potentially dangerous and sometimes lethal as knife crime, it is worth heeding the advice of the police and the judiciary.

Miley's Bangerz tour has caused controversy across the UK [GETTY]
EVER since the first television was thrown from the first hotel bedroom window, the first car driven into a swimming pool and the first star snarled at a hapless interviewer, the big names of rock and pop have been out to shock.
They have run the whole gamut from appearing virtually naked to wearing much of a zoo on their head.
They have sworn, said offensive things about every religious leader ever known, been rude to disabled people and in the infamous case of Prince, refused to speak whatsoever, even when collecting an award.
However there does come a point at which they clearly rock right off their block and Miley Cyrus appears to have reached and crashed through it last week.
In one show at the O2, she gyrated inappropriately, said the F-word 79 times and even introduced the C-word to her tacky act.
As many of her young fans were attracted to her in her Hannah Montana Disney incarnation, this is surely beyond tasteless.
Message to Miley: you were not brought up in a “hood” riddled with gangsta lingo and rap.
Your father wrote Achy Breaky Heart.
Get over yourself.

IF YOUR failure to act soon enough could be seen in any way whatsoever to have contributed to the bungled investigation into the disappearance of a little girl on holiday, wouldn’t you want to put things right at the first opportunity?
So, can anyone explain the ludicrous intransigence of the Portuguese authorities and their failure to help Scotland Yard detectives start digging at once for clues in the Madeleine McCann case?

David Cameron needs to justify this waste of cash [GETTY]
IN JANUARY this year, the Government boasted it would increase the amount of foreign aid given to Nigeria from £200million a year to £270million.
David Cameron seems as hooked on this foolish waste of money as a drug addict is on his next fix.
It takes the sum total of money doled out to Nigeria into the billions of pounds.
Now, just months later we see the corrupt and inept administration of President Goodluck Jonathan in all its ineffectual light.
Having turned its back on the festering problem of hardline Islamic fundamentalism and the rapid growth of terror group Boko Haram, the Nigerian government is now pleading for help to find the 200-plus teenage girls who have been abducted and are to be sold as slaves for as little as £7 a head in actions that would defy the worst script line Hollywood could invent.
Could Mr Cameron kindly step forward and justify all the cash we have sent to this administration which, it has been reported, has also been criticised over the country’s escalating rate of sectarian murders?

DOCTORS are to debate later this month the proposal to charge patients for appointments.
The predictable and dreary socialist class warriors took to the airwaves instantly and proclaimed that this was a betrayal of all that the NHS stood for and reacted as if the sick and the dying would be ignored or turfed out on to the streets from their surgeries.
It is not like that whatsoever and the solution is simple.
If anyone wants to pay the charge, likely to be anywhere between £10 and £25, they should be free to do so but they should also be able to request an appointment in the evening or weekends.
That frees up surgery capacity for everyone else but, sadly, this is one cure the NHS will never offer as no political party has the nerve to support it.
