The Office of National Statistics (ONS) has admitted it missed nearly 350,000 immigrants in its net migration figures over the course of a decade because officials failed to properly count new arrivals landing at regional airports.
The miscalculation has confirmed long-standing claims that immigration from Eastern Europe under Labour was far higher than earlier official estimates suggested.
The ONS blamed the error on the "inadequate sampling" of passengers. Statisticians focused too heavily on counting migrants touching down at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester.
This was despite the spectacular growth in the number of low-cost carriers setting up new routes. Many of these were from new European Union countries and connected with airports such as Luton, Stansted as well as Doncaster, Sheffield, Bournemouth and Southampton.
Regional hubs witnessed dramatic increases in passenger numbers in the first half of the decade, when it was estimated that four out of 10 arrivals touched down at a local airport. A spokesman for David Cameron said the PM had full confidence in the work of the ONS, which compiles official data for the Government.
"What the latest ONS statistics underline is the point at which, in the 2000s, immigration was out of control," a Downing Street spokesman said.
The figures examined the number of migrants coming to the UK between 2001 and 2011. The original figures were based on the International Passenger Survey, originally developed in the 1960s to track population movements in and out of the UK.
However, the number of routes connecting UK airports with the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - which joined the EU in 2004 - increased from 30 in 2001 to a peak of 190 in 2007. This meant citizens arriving at regional airports from these countries in the four years from 2004-08 were not counted.
Carlos Vargas Silva, senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said: "We have known for some time that net migration must have been much higher during the 2001 to 2011 period than the official estimates had suggested."
The PM - who is under pressure to limit rising numbers of migrants within his own party amid a growing challenge from Ukip - has pledged to reduce the net numbers of new arrivals to below 100,000 by 2015.
