Feature | SUMMER TV
Mr Sloane
Sky Atlantic, 23 May
What is it?
A six-part, bittersweet rom-com about the hapless, hard-on-his-luck Mr Sloane, an accountant in the throes of a mid-life crisis. But it’s 1969, and things might just be about to swing his way…
Why should I be excited?
Directed by Curb Your Enthusiasm’s Robert B Weide, it stars Nick Frost. We’re also taken by the support: Olivia Colman – up for a Bafta tonight – is his estranged wife, and Ophelia Lovibond is the wild (if wildly improbable) love interest.
Worthy watch?
It may be set in Watford, but Mr Sloane doesn’t exactly look gritty.
Haven’t we seen this before?
Mad Men it ain’t – this is a very British take on the 1960s. Frost exhibits his standard everyman, down-the-pub humour perfected in the Cornetto trilogy with Simon Pegg.
Eye candy
Ophelia Lovibond.
Who should I watch with?
Someone who was young in 1969: listen to them hold forth about how “the 1960s were nothing like that really” shortly before they come over all mistyeyed at the Kinks soundtrack.
Playhouse Presents
Sky Arts, May/June
What is it?
Sky’s neat strand of standalone dramas continues to provide a platform for top writing and starry turns. The season is underway, but there are gems coming up over the summer.
Why should I be excited?
Polly Stenham makes her TV debut with Foxtrot, a girl-gang heist starring Billie Piper and Ben Whishaw. Space Age has fruity Richard Wilson and Simon Callow as ageing astronauts, while Cara Delevingne tries her acting chops in Timeless.
Worthy watch?
Best of both worlds: the stars and the smarts, darling…
Haven’t we seen this before?
Well, this is the third series of Playhouse Presents, but they’re supposedly all different in their own special way.
Eye candy
Cara Delevingne and Ben Whishaw.
Who should I watch with?
That insufferable culture vulture who insists they’d rather be at the theatre than watching TV. This’ll learn ’em.
The Honourable Woman
BBC2, July
What is it?
An eight-part thriller about a businesswoman whose handling of contracts in the Middle East sees her embroiled in the Israel-Palestine conflict – and scrutinised by the Secret Service.
Why should I be excited?
It’s got proper Hollywood stardust, in the form of Maggie Gyllenhaal in the main role. An ambitious and unflinching look at a major conflict, written by Hugo Blick – so expect it to twist and turn till you feel positively giddy.
Worthy watch?
It’s about the Israel- Palestine conflict, so very-very-serious.
Haven’t we seen this before?
Blick’s previous hit was The Shadow Line, a crime drama. But the Middle East setting should raise the stakes beyond your usual whodunnit.
Eye candy
Maggie Gyllenhaal.
Who should I watch with?
A friend who’s up on Middle East politics. And possibly a whiteboard, for keeping track of what’s going on.
Melvyn Bragg’s Radical Lives
BBC2, July
What is it?
Two-part documentary looking at radical political thinkers John Ball and Thomas Paine. Ball was at the heart of the Peasant’s Revolt in 1381, while Paine was the 18thcentury theorist whose Rights of Man really did change the world.
Why should I be excited?
Rebellion! Revolution! Uprising! Intellectual political theory! How much more excitement could you take?!
Worthy watch?
Off-the-scale.
Haven’t we seen this before?
Basically In Our Time on the telly.
Eye candy
Erm… Thomas Paine cut a bit of a dash as a young man.
Who should I watch with?
Apathetic teenagers in need of political galvanisation/a “proper education”.
This Old Thing
Channel 4, July
What is it?
A series celebrating vintage fashion: perky Dawn O’Porter attempts to “cure” the nation of its addiction to fast-fashion, inducting a “vintage virgin” into the joys of thrift each week, while seamstresses are on hand to restyle old frocks.
Why should I be excited?
Might have been exciting about a decade ago, before “vintage” got coopted by the high-street as a way to sell hacked-up manky 1980s dresses for a small fortune.
Worthy watch?
More guilty pleasure than worthy watch: the televisual equivalent of a cheeky payday shopping spree.
Haven’t we seen this before?
How to Look Good Naked stitched together with Bargain Hunt.
Eye candy
Dawn O’Porter.
Who should I watch with?
Girly chums, and that dress you’ve been meaning to hem all year…
Silicon Valley
Sky Atlantic, July
What is it?
New HBO comedy series takes swipes at the socially awkward, overpaid uber-geeks of San Francisco’s tech mecca. It’s a biting satire of the cultural zeitgeist – but don’t let that put you off…
Why should I be excited?
Created by Mike Judge (Beavis and Butthead), it’s already had some seriously good reviews in America.
Worthy watch?
Mostly pleasurable, in fact – albeit pleasure spiked with wincing comedy pain.
Haven’t we seen this before?
Imagine The IT Crowd re-programmed by The Social Network.
Eye candy
Thomas Middleditch.
Who should I watch with?
Geeks: witness them squirm. And also feel kinda validated in their life choices.
Nick & Margaret: Immigration – Gain or Drain?
BBC1, July
What is it?
Former Apprentice stooges present a two-part social “experiment”where immigrants live and work with real-proper- born-n-bred- Britons, to see if they are a “gain or drain”.
Why should I be excited?
Oh my! What’s that loud noise?! That’s the sound of the Beeb slamming on the accelerator in the race to the bottom…
Worthy watch?
Sure to be carefully engineered saccharine moments of revelation amongst the prejudice and stats.
Haven’t we seen this before?
The Big British Immigration Row: Live
Invasion of the Job Snatchers
Benefits Street
Nick and Margaret: We All Pay Your Benefits
Eye candy
Margaret has her followers, we’re told.
Who should I watch with?
Twitter, so you can add to the stream of harumphing lefty-liberal dismay.
The Great Instrument Amnesty
Channel 4, August
What is it?
A musical revolution: presenter James Rhodes persuades those with unwanted musical instruments to donate them to schools, while he lobbies the Government for greater funds for musical education.
Why should I be excited?
Likely to tug more (heart)strings than a pizzicato passage, as youngsters turn their lives around through music.
Worthy watch?
Worthy ambition, sentimental delivery?
Haven’t we seen this before?
Doing for potential players what The Choir did for shy singers. Doing for music departments what Jamie’s School Dinners did for canteens.
Eye candy
James Rhodes.
Who should I watch with?
Your mum. We predict Rhodes is going to be the next “that nice Gareth Malone”.
The Secrets
BBC1, August
What is it?
Five stand-alone films, showcasing new writing talent, all featuring terse encounters where dark secrets come to light.
Why should I be excited?
Dominic Savage directs; writers include playwright Nick Payne (Constellations) and Bafta-nominated Him & Her’s Sarah Solemani, who writes and stars in her episode. Also features Sally Hawkins, and Olivia Colman (again).
Worthy watch?
Sounds emosh, but quality nonetheless.
Haven’t we seen this before?
Sure to be similar to Savage’s True Love series – though we’re pleased to hear he’s brought in some writers this time rather than leaving the actors to improvise again.
Eye candy
A veritable bunch of English Roses: Froggatt, Baxendale, Fox…
Who should I watch with?
Eagle-eyed friends, and IMD B on your smartphone, for all those “oh-what-were-they-in?” moments you get with casts of British thesps.
Made in Chelsea: New York
E4, late summer
What is it?
A mini-series that sees the Sloanes go West: six parts follow the SW 3 gang as they swan about in New York.
Why should I be excited?
Are you still excited about MiC? No? Then watching them gape at Bloomingdale’s probably isn’t going to help. Move along.
Worthy watch?
We doubt Melvyn’s a fan.
Haven’t we seen this before?
Will be totes similar to Made in Chelsea, durrrr!
Eye candy
Rosie Fortescu.
Who should I watch with?
A bottle of wine and a tub of ice-cream: let guilty pleasures be served in threes.
