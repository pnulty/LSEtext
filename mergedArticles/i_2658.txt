The Home Office will not intervene in the case of a Mauritian student facing deportation. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire has told the House of Commons that 19-year-old Yashika Bageerathi's case has been through proper legal process, and the Home Office's decision that she does not need protection from violence or persecution in her homeland has been upheld.
