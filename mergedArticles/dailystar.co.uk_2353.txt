TELLY bosses sparked outrage yesterday with their plans for an Immigration Street reality show.
The documentary will feature migrants’ lifestyle and their relations with the locals.
It is being made by Love Productions, who created the controversial Channel 4 series Benefits Street.
Producers have chosen Derby Road in Southampton as the setting for filming.

But community leaders and politicians fear the area will suffer the same problems that Benefits Street brought to Birmingham.
Alan Whitehead, Labour MP for Southampton Test, said: “Derby Road is a very vibrant, diverse and strong working part of Southampton.
"It seems quite extraordinary that a company wants to come and brand an area with a particular name they have decided in advance.
“I do fear, with their track record, this is not going to be a show which actually points out all of the good things.”
A Channel 4 spokesman said: “The title and location are not yet confirmed and discussions are ongoing with local people.”
