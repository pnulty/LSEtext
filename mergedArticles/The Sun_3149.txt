WE all knew about the immigration chaos Labour inflicted on Britain. Until yesterday we didn't know quite how huge the numbers were. And neither did Labour.
It turns out officials wrongly totted up the millions the Blair and Brown regimes let in. They missed 346,000 migrants, enough to populate a city.
Even today we are still being misled. Current immigration minister James Brokenshire says the Coalition's "long-term economic plan is reducing immigration".
But the numbers are rising again.
Labour's Yvette Cooper apologises for her party's shameful record. She has little choice. Then she laughably tells us that now she would count every migrant in or out.
Listen carefully ... you'll hear the stable door being slammed shut and hooves galloping down the street.
