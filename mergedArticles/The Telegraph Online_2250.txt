Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says Prince Charles is "perfectly entitled" to express, especially if expressing them privately, following reported controversial comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin
 The Prince of Wales  sparked controversy by reportedly comparing the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.
His remark came during a tour of the Museum of Immigration in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where the Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall paid tribute to Second World War veterans and their families.
But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg defended the Prince today on his LBC Radio phone-in saying he was "free to express himself".
He said: "Don't think anyone should provide a running commentary on what was clearly considered to be a private conversation.
"Prince Charles should be perfectly entitled to express views in the confidence that he's expressing them privately."
