MOST people want Holyrood to control immigration, according to a survey.
Two-thirds support the transfer of the power from Westminster, including almost half of those who plan to vote against independence.
Green MSP Alison Johnstone, whose party commissioned the poll, said: "There is a huge economic opportunity for Scotland if we have control over immigration policy. The only option on the table that will deliver the approach we need is a Yes vote in September."
The poll shows 66.3 per cent agree MSPs should control immigration. Almost all Yes voters and 41.2 per cent of No voters back the transfer. A little over 20 per cent want immigration run by Westminster, including 39.8 per cent of No voters.
Just over 1,000 people aged over 16 were quizzed in Scotland by Survation on March 6 and 7.
