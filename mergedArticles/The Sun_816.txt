RICH foreigners should be forced to bid millions for fast-track visas, official government advisers said yesterday.
The Migration Advisory Committee said 100 "premium" visas should be auctioned off every year.
A reserve price of £2.5million would include a guarantee of £500,000 for "good causes" such as Cancer Research or sport funding.
Wealthy foreigners can currently buy their way in by lending the Government £1million.
MAC chair Sir David Metcalf said: "The system is designed to minimise gains to UK residents and maximise migrant's gains."
The committee said 560 visas were granted to "investors" in the year to October 2013, compared with 140 in 2009.
Its report threatens to ignite the row between Home Secretary Theresa May and Business Secretary Vince Cable, who said a year ago rules should be relaxed to encourage Chinese immigrants or tourists.
