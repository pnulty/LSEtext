ROMA migrants living in the UK shamelessly boast about how they came to the country to exploit the generous welfare state in a documentary on Channel 5. One man openly reveals his plan to make £40,000 from benefits to build a house in his home village.
A mother-of-eleven brazenly thanks Britain for giving benefits of more than £400 a week.
The programme - Gypsies On Benefits And Proud - follows three Roma migrants. Father-of-three Ion Lazar is seen travelling to the UK with five fellow immigrants, just days after new visa rules came into force.
The 36-year-old confesses: "I know it's very, very easy to take benefits in England. She's give me home free, she's give me money free, she's give me everything."
He admits that he wants to send huge amounts of British taxpayers' cash back to his family so they can build a new house in the village where he grew up. He adds: "I need maybe 40 thousand from benefits... four zero thousand pounds for my family and I think this money I can make in one years maybe two."
On a Rotherham estate, Slovakian Katarina Cisarova, 43, who has 11 children and 11 grandchildren living nearby, boasts about her life of £430 a week on benefits. She says: "It's very nice. Big family yeah, Slovakia people. We have a good life here. We have everything we want."
Viorel Dinu, 25, who lost both legs as a child, has given up begging in Bucharest to live in Nottingham, where he gets £750 a month in benefits. He says: "In Romania it's very hard with the money and everything. Every door is open here, this is the most easy."
Producer Jacqui Wilson said the programme would "challenge some viewers' thoughts about gypsies". ?Gypsies On Benefits And Proud, Friday April 11 at 9pm on Channel 5.
