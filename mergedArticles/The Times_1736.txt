An illegal immigrant who murdered a British teenager less than a year after he arrived in the UK cannot be deported because he is gay, a senior judge has ruled.
The 29-year-old killer, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been released after Lord Justice Maurice Kay said that sending him back to Jamaica would violate his human rights as a homosexual.
The murderer, referred to only as JR, arrived in Britain in December 2000 when he was 15 and was "party to the murder of another teenage boy" less than a year later in 2001, the judge said.
He was sentenced to detention at Her Majesty's pleasure in September 2002, and freed from prison in June 2012. Since his release Theresa May, the home secretary, has tried to have him repatriated.
JR successfully appealed against the home secretary's decision to deport him to the First-Tier Tribunal (FTT), and the Upper Tribunal refused a challenge to that decision brought by Mrs May last year.
Now Lord Justice Kay, sitting with Lord Justice Lewison and Sir Stanley Burnton at the Court of Appeal in London, has blocked the government's final attempt to have JR deported. The FTT accepted he was gay and that he would be at risk of "inhuman or degrading treatment" if sent home.
