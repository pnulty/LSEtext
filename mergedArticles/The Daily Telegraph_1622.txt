THOUSANDS of foreign criminals and illegal immigrants are still in Britain despite the Home Office having secured 6,000 travel documents to remove them.
Almost half have not been removed because casework is still ongoing and up to one in four has gone missing, according to the borders and immigration watchdog.
John Vine, the chief inspector of borders, said 6,460 emergency travel documents – when an illegal immigrant or foreign criminal does not have a passport – had been obtained from foreign embassies. The Home Office claimed that in many cases travel documents were obtained at the very outset of a case.
Mr Vine also said that two thirds of immigration raids were conducted with inappropriate use of search powers.
