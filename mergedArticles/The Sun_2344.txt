IF Ukip had any kind of foothold in Scotland, they'd be having a field day.
How Nigel Farage and his gang would jump all over the latest study that shows Scotland would have to increase immigration under independence.
The report by investment giant Exane BNP Paribas warns that our ageing population — more so than the rest of the UK — means we have less people to generate wealth and extra folk to support.
So we'd need incomers to help provide the country with a strong labour force and maintain a healthy economy.
Of course there will always be concerns about unfettered immigration and rightly so.
But Scots have never shown the same kind of relish that the policies of Ukip — and the watered down versions of the bandwagon-jumping mainstream parties — have garnered south of the border.
Indeed the Nats have made no secret of the fact they would increase immigration after a Yes vote.
The only glove their opponents can lay on them on this issue is that they have never made clear by how much and how quickly.
Strict controls would have to be put in place.
But as a nation which has made a history of settling in all corners of the globe, it would be ironic if Scots wanted to slam their own door.
