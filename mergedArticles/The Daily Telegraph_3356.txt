Perilous Question
by Antonia Fraser
PHOENIX, £9.99 *****
Antonia Fraser's superb narrative of the passing of the Great Reform Bill of 1832, one of the most potentially revolutionary moments in British politics, provides incisive pen portraits of all the major protagonists. And it is expressive of an age when, despite everything, enlightened rationality informed political discourse.
Marriage Material
by Sathnam Sanghera
WINDMILL, £8.99 ****
Sathnam Sanghera's comedy of race relations features a family of Sixties Punjabi immigrants and their descendant Arjan, the narrator, who had escaped to London and a media career but is plunged back into Wolverhampton life on the death of his father. This novel is so poignant it hurts; it also elicits tears of laughter.
Something Like Happy
by John Burnside
VINTAGE, £8.99 ****
The 13 stories in this collection offer all the customary satisfactions of John Burnside's writing – anomie, menace, flashes of violence and cruelty, hallucinations and snow – but multiplied. These tropes are occasionally overdone, but even Burnside's most routine stories have beauty and intelligence. He is never less than something like brilliant.
