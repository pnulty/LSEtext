IMMIGRATION ROW
The Conservative immigration minister, James Brokenshire, gave a speech in which he said that a "wealthy metropolitan elite" of middle-class households has helped to support mass immigration to Britain by demanding cheap labour and services. Mr Brokenshire accused Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, of "asserting falsehoods" about immigration. Mr Cable said that "bearing down on economic migration is a clear example of a restriction on trade" and it could hurt the UK economy.
TWITTER DIPLOMACY
As the crisis in Ukraine continued, Prime Minister David Cameron posted a photograph on Twitter showing him on the phone, with a tweet saying: "I've been speaking to @BarackObama about the situation in Ukraine. We are united in condemnation of Russia's actions." Mr Cameron had a welcome supporter at Prime Minister's Questions. His wife, Samantha, appeared in a VIP gallery. It was the second time she has attended PMQs.
PISTORIUS TRIAL
The start of the trial of the South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius gripped the world's media. Mr Pistorius's former girlfriend told the trial that he once fired his gun from his car sunroof after becoming angry with police. In the United States, a Californian businessman who lost $500,000 (£299,000) at a Las Vegas casino, sued it for serving him drinks and lending him money while, he claimed, he was clearly intoxicated. Under Nevada law, casinos should not allow patrons who are visibly drunk to gamble.
