1/15 A subheading on a report about the death of Christine Case at an immigration removal centre in Bedfordshire (Flowers and poems as shocked Yarl's Wood detainees mourn dead woman, 4 April, page 12) was wrong to say that she suffered a heart attack in her cell. As the article itself said, a postmortem found that Case died of a massive pulmonary thromboembolism.
* An article about Facebook buying Oculus, the maker of virtual reality headsets, said that earlier in March it had announced the purchase of Titan Aerospace. It did not acquire Titan, but was said to be in talks to do so (Poke in the eye: Facebook bets on a future seen through sci-fi goggles, 27 March, page 12).
* A report referred to "a silicon face mask" worn by Naomi Oni, who suffered serious burns after acid was thrown at her (12-year prison term for acid attack on friend, 22 March, page 6). A silicone face mask, it should have said.
1/15 Homophone corner: "But how would Gladstone have faired with his booming scouse habit of addressing Queen Victoria (so she said) as if she were a public meeting?" (The making of Milibrand, 3 April, page 6, G2).
