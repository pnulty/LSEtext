NIGEL Farage has said he felt "awkward" on a recent train journey in London when he heard only foreign languages spoken by fellow passengers.
Pressed on the immigration themes in his earlier speech during Ukip's spring conference in Torquay, Mr Farage denied he felt people should be forced to speak English on trains.
But the Ukip leader (pictured) said: "I got the train the other night, it was rush hour. It wasn't until after we got past Grove Park that I could actually hear English being audibly spoken in the carriage. Does that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes.
"I wonder what's really going on. And I'm sure that's a view that will be reflected by three quarters of the population, perhaps even more. "That does not mean one is anti immigration, we're not anti immigration, but we do absolutely believe we should be able to judge it both on quantity and quality."
In his earlier speech, he said: "The fact that in scores of our cities and towns, this country in a short space of time has become unrecognisable. This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."
