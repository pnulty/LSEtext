Arrogant leaders are helping UKIP IT is all very well David Cameron and Nick Clegg casting aspersions at UKIP members. However, it is due to the contempt and arrogance of these two men, plus Ed Miliband, that the popularity of the UKIP is growing. Anyone who dares to express a concern about the EU or immigration is classed as a racist or little Englander.
These people have no desire to join the BNP or EDL. However, until arrogant politicians start listening to the people who place them in office, I am sure the popularity of the UKIP will grow.
