BRITAIN was today hit with a new immigration bombshell as official figures showed the number of Romanians and Bulgarians arriving in the UK trebled in 2013.
The Office for National Statistics said this morning that 24,000 citizens from the two countries arrived in the year to September 2013, nearly three times the 9,000 who arrived in the previous 12 months.
The ONS said this was “statistically significant" and that around 70 per cent came to work, while 30 per cent came to study.
Their figures also showed the Government was slipping behind its target for reducing overall net migration–the difference between migrants leaving and arriving in the UK.
David Cameron wants the net number reduced to the tens of thousands but the figure soared to 212,000 in the period from 154,000 the previous year.
Figures are not yet available for the numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians who have arrived in the UK since January 1 when labour market restrictions were lifted to comply with EU rules.
