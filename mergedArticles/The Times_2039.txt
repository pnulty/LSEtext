Labour voters are defecting to Ukip because the party has become too "middle class", a leading ally of Ed Miliband has warned.
Lord Glasman, a policy guru ennobled by Mr Miliband, said the rise of Ukip would hit Labour "in the heartlands". He urged the party to adopt measures to win back working-class support and that Labour needed to address concerns about immigration and welfare.
"That is the dilemma at the heart of the party's strategy — is it possible to address these economic, political and cultural concerns when the party is becoming, in many ways, very middle class? What I mean by that is liberal and progressive in its sensibility," he told The Times.
"Ed [Miliband] is trying to address it. This is a long-term trend since 2001, in terms of the working-class vote just declining quite dramatically. The Labour middle-class vote held up [in 2010]. It was the working-class vote that died. These are often people who are earning, who have jobs, but they don't see Labour as representing their interests."
Ukip has surged into first place in polls before European elections next month. Nigel Farage's party is at 31 per cent for the vote, according to YouGov, three points clear of Labour and 12 ahead of the Tories.
Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, denounced as "disgusting" comments by a Ukip candidate about the comedian Lenny Henry. William Henwood, a candidate in Enfield, North London, said Mr Henry should emigrate to a "black country". Echoing David Cameron's remarks in 2006 that Ukip was made up of "fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists", Mr Hunt said Mr Farage should explain why his party had racist candidates.
