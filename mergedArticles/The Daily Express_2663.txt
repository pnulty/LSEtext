SOARING numbers of Romanians are pouring into Britain looking for jobs, with applications twice as high as last year, new figures reveal.
The shock increase comes after EU rules forced Britain to drop visa restrictions on job seekers from Romania and Bulgaria from January 1. The UK is now the top destination for Romanian job hunters.
Romania's leading recruitment website had 42,562 applications for UK jobs from an estimated 23,000 people in the first three months of the year.
In the same period last year there were only 18,369 applications put in by 11,708 jobseekers.
Germany, the second most popular destination, received less than half the number of CVs sent to the UK.
The figures appear to back fears of a mass influx of cheap labour in the country's jobs market which could depress wages, take badly-needed work away from Britons and increase the strain on public services.
Ukip Euro MP Gerard Batten said: "It is clear the removal of transitional controls on Romanians and Bulgarians has caused this increase in jobseekers wanting to come here. These figures bear out worries that there is going to be a steady stream of people coming to the UK to work and claim benefits.
"This will continue to put pressure on the NHS, housing and other social services. We can't blame the individuals but it is clearly not a sensible or controlled immigration policy to open the doors to anyone who wants to come here."
Tory backbench MP Nigel Mills said imported "cheap" labour was going to make things worse for the 2.4 million people unemployed in Britain.
He added: "It's not any attempt to blame Romanians, but this is a time when we still have unemployment far higher than we'd like it."
The latest jobs figures were published by Tjobs.ro, Romania's biggest job website.
It is the first comprehensive look at the effect of Romanian jobseekers on Britain and other EU countries since controls were lifted at the start of the year.
Up until January 1, citizens from Romania and Bulgaria needed a permit to come and work in the UK.
Today's research showed that UK firms advertised 31,588 vacancies on the site between January and March this year - up 60 per cent on the same period last year. The number of British vacancies is double that for Greece and triple those from Germany.
Most of the jobs advertised were in hotels and tourism, followed by care work, agriculture and catering.
The hospitality industry attracted the most applications.
Raluca Stefanescu of Tjobs said: "There are always many people who want to work abroad.
"The coverage (in the Press) brought lot of attention to the opportunities in the UK."
He said Romanians offered UK employers a "hardworking, skilled workforce to fill vacancies".
