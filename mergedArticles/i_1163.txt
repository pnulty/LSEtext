The internet was yesterday awash with spoofed versions of the Conservatives' 'beer and bingo' Budget poster. It's not the first time a political advertisement has backfired.
'Labour Isn't Working' was voted the most successful ever political slogan in 1999. In an example of political messages playing to different crowds, when used by the Republicans in 2012, it was criticised for reinforcing racial stereotypes.
Wall-scribbling was brought into the internet age in 2010.
Photoshopped suffixes to 'I've never voted Conservative before' were collected at MYDAVIDCAMERON.com. The Tories soon hit back with MYLABOURPOSTER.typepad.com.
Michael Howard's 2005 election slogan gave anyone with a spray can the opportunity to tell the Conservatives just what they did think of them via their nearest billboard. The immigration poster was particularly attacked for being 'racist'.
Labour's attempts to paint Cameron as TV character Gene Hunt sprawled on the bonnet of an Audi were seized upon by his own party who liked the appeal it gave him. They quickly issued an online version reading: "Fire up the Quattro. It"s time for change.
Post-Iraq, the Tory portrayal of Blair with demon eyes might seem fitting. But in 1997 people didn't see him as evil, dishonest or untrustworthy. Met by a hostile public reaction, the campaign was soon pulled.
