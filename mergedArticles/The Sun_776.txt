TWO groups of equally hateful people, with opposing political opinions, shout "LET ME FINISH" at each other in a studio.
An hour or two later, no one's changed their mind. In fact, both views have become even more angry, entrenched and obnoxious.
And this, apparently, is a TV show. BBC1 calls it Question Time. On Channel 4 it's Benefits Britain: The Live Debate.
But on Channel 5 last week it was The Big British Immigration Row, hosted by Nick Ferrari and Anne Diamond, which was prompted by an opinion poll that revealed "65 per cent of our population is worried about immigration".
If you thought the stat would be reflected in the studio audience or believed the channel's claim "this show's open to everyone", though, then you clearly don't understand what drives TV.
Katie Hopkins is their dancing bear and everyone else pokes her with a stick. The more famous the better.
So, as well as the usual professional hecklers from the lunatic fringe, and Katie, we had Adam Rickitt, the dance coach from Fame Academy, Paula Hamilton, someone captioned as "Kelvin McKenzie" (spelling klaxon) and star political turn Nancy Dell'Olio, who began thrashing around wildly, in fractured English.
"Zis country much better whizz all zee immigrants. You see the heffer they make. Why you feel fear? Dey don't take anything."
Apart from Ulrika Jonsson, obviously. That heffer take everything.
