Immigration minister James Brokenshire said the jump was largely down to the Syrian crisis.
But there were also a growing number of bogus claims from immigrants already here.
In 2010, 17,916 asylum applications were received by UK authorities.
The Minister said the numbers in April could be 30 per cent higher - nearly 5,400 cases.
He insisted the problem was being seen across Europe, with asylum applications in Germany in 2012 up 56 per cent on 2010.
He said: “We want to offer speedy protection to those who qualify for it.
“An obstacle for doing so lies in the fact that many claims are unfounded.
“While some of these claimants will have a genuine fear of prosecution, others are simply seeking to use the system to stay in the UK."
In a response to a withering Select Committee report, the Minister insisted the vast majority of applications should be handled within 6 months.
But he admitted more caseworkers and support staff were having to be recruited to handle the mountain of paperwork.
The figures come a month after a report revealed net migration has soared 212,000 in the past year.
The Prime Minister vowed in 2010 to bring the number down to the tens of thousands by 2015.
