UKIP could win 30 per cent of the popular vote if it can get its message across, according to an academic study published today.
The analysis of the views of 100,000 voters shows support for the party is driven not just by Euroscepticism but also by hostility to immigration and intense dissatisfaction with the three main parties.
It suggests that a third of voters share at least two of these values and might be persuaded to vote for UKIP. The study also finds the party's potential support has increased since the start of the financial crisis.
Robert Ford, a University of Manchester academic and co-author of the report, said: 'UKIP are winning over one voter in ten but their potential far exceeds their current support in the polls by a margin of three to one. This revolt has been a long time coming, but may have a long way to run.'
The study suggests that UKIP is increasingly attracting working class voters and others who feel 'left behind' and are not part of the educated and middle class mainstream.
