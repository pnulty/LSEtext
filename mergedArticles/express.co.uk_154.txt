WHILE Twitter was abuzz last night as Nigel Farage and Nick Clegg went head-to-head in an EU debate, the vast majority of MPs appeared to be indifferent.
More than 38,000 tweets were sent using the official hashtag #EuropeDebate during the hour-long debate, but only 63 of the 455 MPs on Twitter tweeted.
They tweeted 351 times collectively, with a huge 88 tweets by Lib Dem MP Julian Huppert alone, research by Yatterbox found.
Ukip leader Mr Farage saw his Twitter account gain 2,728 followers from the start of the debate to 11am today - taking him to 113,642 followers
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg saw his following grow by just 559 over the same period - but his 160,596 followers still dwarfs fans of Mr Farage.
Polls carried out after the debate showed the public believed Mr Farage had won convincingly won the debate, which was hosted by the BBC and also broadcast on Sky News.
