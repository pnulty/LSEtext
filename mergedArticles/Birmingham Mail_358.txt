WERE we all not so wearily used to the shortcomings of our public bodies, we might be tempted to say that the story of Lucy Mbugua beggars belief.
Here was a an illegal immigrant who was allowed to defraud the benefits system out of Â£26,000 when she had already been ordered out of the country.
Let's breath a sigh of relief that data-matching systems led to her being nabbed after four years of cheating.
But the tight-lipped Home Office has to answer questions about why she was not only allowed to remain in Britain, but could get away with claiming money to which she had no entitlement.
A shocking failure.
