Ms Miller's departure follows a long-line of red-faced exits from Cabinet
Maria Miller is the latest MP to resign from the Cabinet amid a row over expenses claimed on a second home. But the Culture Secretary is far from the first MP to leave Parliament shrouded in controversy if the sex scandals, pay-per-view-porn expenses claims and attempts at having a ‘floating duck house’ reimbursed are considered.
The expenses scandal of 2009 revealed some uncomfortable truths over exactly what MPs were claiming from tax-payers’ money.
It saw the first Commons Speaker to be forced out of office for more than 300 years over criticism of his handling of the scandal, while the first female Home Secretary eventually stood down from her post after it was revealed her husband claimed for two pay-per-view adult films.
Yet Westminster has seen its fair share of controversy since. Former defence secretary Liam Fox was left red-faced when it came to light that he successfully claimed 3p of taxpayers’ cash for a car journey of fewer than 100 metres.
In pictures: Embarrassing political exits 
The former immigration minister Mark Harper is the most recent to give up his post after it emerged his cleaner was working in the UK illegally, in another public exchange of letters between an apologetic MP and the Prime Minister.
