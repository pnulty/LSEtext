JOBLESS immigrants flocking to Britain to scrounge state handouts are costing taxpayers £10million a year.
Around 3,000 European "benefit tourists" are living rent-free after pocketing £100 each week in housing handouts.
More than half continue to make claims for at least six months on average and more than a third for longer than a year.
Welfare
The figures, by the Department of Work and Pensions, paint a damning picture of how Britain's welfare system is being exploited.
It is based on a 12-month period between 2011 and 2012.
Work and Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, said: "It is simply not right that migrants were able to receive taxpayers' money in the form of housing benefit without having first made a contribution to the country."
