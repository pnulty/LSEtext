THE number of immigrants arriving in Britain puts a huge strain on housing, schools, hospitals and transport systems.
But to blame that influx for the 2.34million people on the dole is to miss a vital point.
As Martin Daubney discovers on Pages 22 and 23, migrants get many minimum-wage jobs because they're simply more willing to do them — and with a smile on their face.
