SOME 331 immigrants have been rescued from a fishing boat stranded in Greek waters after making a distress call.
The Greek Coast Guard yesterday transferred the passengers — including 40 children and 24 women — to a crude oil tanker between the islands of Crete and Kythira.
Ministry officials said the immigrants appeared to be in good health and will be taken to Crete, but did not confirm media reports that most people on board were from Syria and Egypt.
Greece is a major illegal entry point for immigrants hoping to get into the EU.
