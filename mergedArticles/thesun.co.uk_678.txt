Theresa May leapt to the defence of immigration minister James Brokenshire - who was slammed last week for saying only the “wealthy elite" benefit from the migrant flood.
She told the House of Commons immigration had “the greatest impact at the lowest end of the income scale".
And she insisted Mr Brokenshire’s debut speech last week had contributed to the nation’s “constructive debate" on the issue.
She said: “Uncontrolled gross immigration of course does put pressure on our public services and infrastructure.
“And as (Mr Brokenshire) has pointed out, the people who suffer from the impact of uncontrolled immigration are those at the lower end of the income scale."
Mr Brokenshire last week said the “wealthy metropolitan elite" benefit most from immigration given the arrival of large numbers of migrants drives down the cost of certain services.
The speech drew a fierce response in private from his own Ministers - as well as the business community.
And they led to accusations of double standards by the Government, given the PM David Cameron hired a Nepalese nanny, who has since gained British citizenship.
Theresa May again conceded the Government’s hopes of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands by 2015 was becoming a “more difficult".
A surge in EU migrants had pushed net migration up 30 per cent to 212,000 in the past year.
Ms May said: “I fully accept the most recent figures have made the task more difficult."
