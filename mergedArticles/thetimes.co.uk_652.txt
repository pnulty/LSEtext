A senior immigration judge has agreed to step down after it emerged he was housing an illegal immigrant from Nigeria.
Richard McKee, 65, resigned after admitting that he was giving financial support to Fatima Umar, a 39-year-old Nigerian woman who had overstayed her UK visa.
Umar assaulted two police constables when she was arrested at the home she shared with Mr McKee in Kilburn, north London, in February.
She is now serving two eight-week jail terms for the twin assault and for causing nearly £5,000 damage at Mr McKee’s flat.
Police records show Umar also assaulted the judge in 2011 and was sentenced to 14 weeks in jail, it was reported last night.
Two years ago, Mr McKee was named as one of three judges who had allowed 26 foreign criminals to avoid deportation and stay in the UK because of their “right to family life". The judge ruled in favour of 11 foreign criminals in 13 cases between 2011 and 2012.
A spokeswoman for the Judicial Office said it was brought to the Chamber President’s attention that Judge McKee was providing financial support to an alleged immigration offender.
She told The Sun: “This was put to Mr McKee who resigned with effect from February 4."
