PROTESTERS who penned Ukip leader Nigel Farage inside an Edinburgh pub on his last visit to Scotland have warned they will turn out in force when he returns this week.
Farage will address supporters at the Capital's Corn Exchange on Friday in his sole Scottish visit before the May 22 European Parliament vote.
About 50 chanting students and socialists besieged him as he gave media interviews in a pub near the Scottish Parliament in May last year. A Ukip spokesman said Mr Farage "would not be deterred by "a bunch of middle-class students" demonstrating.
Law graduate Andrew Ashe, 22, of the Radical Independence Campaign, said the group would tell Ukip its message of "scapegoating immigrants" for wider economic problems was not welcome in Scotland.
