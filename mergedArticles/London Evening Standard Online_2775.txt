There was a "statistically significant" increase in the numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians arriving in the UK last year, official figures show, as the Government's target of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands slipped further away.
Some 24,000 citizens of Romania and Bulgaria arrived in the year to September 2013, nearly three times the 9,000 who arrived in the previous year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Around 70% came to work, while 30% came to study.
Meanwhile, overall net migration - the difference between migrants leaving and arriving in the UK - soared to 212,000 in the period from 154,000 the previous year, moving further away from Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May's hopes to bring the figure down to below 100,000 by the 2015 general election.
Some 532,000 people immigrated to the UK in the year ending September, up from the 497,000 people who arrived during the previous year, while 320,000 emigrants left the country, down from the 343,000 the previous year.
A surge in European Union citizens arriving in the UK has driven the increase, rising to 209,000 from 149,000 the previous year, the ONS said.
Some 65,000 citizens of so-called EU15 countries, that is pre-2004 members of the union, arrived to work in the UK in the period, an increase of 23,000 when compared to the previous year.
However, immigration of non-EU citizens saw a statistically significant decrease to 244,000 in the period, down from 269,000 the previous year.
Statisticians said this was due to fewer New Commonwealth citizens - such as those from India - migrating to the UK for formal study.
The drop in non-EU citizens is likely to fuel fears that Britain is being perceived as "closed for business" by foreign students who are seen by many as valuable to the British economy.
Romanian and Bulgarian citizens arriving for work-related reasons in the same period stood at 17,000, of which 11,000 reported having a definite job, the ONS said, up from 2,000 the previous year.
The two eastern European countries joined the EU on January 1 2007.
Since then, migrants from Bulgaria and Romania coming to the UK were subject to transitional employment restrictions, which placed limits on the kind of employment they could undertake - such as self-employed status or skilled work.
However, these restrictions ended on January 1 this year, giving unfettered access to the UK labour market.
Against a backdrop of growing concerns of an influx of Romanians and Bulgarians to the UK, and a surge in popularity for the UK Independence Party, the Prime Minister last year unveiled a series of tough measures designed to clamp down on abuse of free movement between EU member states.
Immigration and security minister James Brokenshire, who recently took on the role after Mark Harper MP stepped down amid controversy surrounding the immigration status of his cleaner, said: " Uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on our public services and forces down wages for people on low incomes.
"Our reforms have cut non-EU migration to its lowest level since 1998 and there are now 82,000 fewer people arriving annually from outside the EU than when this government came to power.
"And overall figures are also well down from when we first came to government in 2010 - with nearly 70,000 fewer migrants coming to the UK.
"Numbers are down across the board in areas where we can control immigration, but arrivals from the EU have doubled in the last year.
"The Government is ensuring that our controls on accessing benefits and services, including the NHS and social housing, are among the tightest in Europe.
"We cannot impose formal immigration controls on EU migrants, so we are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and seeking to address the factors that drive European immigration to Britain.
"We are building an immigration system that is fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants, that is tough on those who abuse the system or flout the law, and that ensures people come to the UK for the right reasons - to work hard and contribute to our economy and society."
