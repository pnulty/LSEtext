A Mauritian student was being deported from Britain last night despite last–ditch efforts to keep her in Britain.
Yashika Bageerathi, 19, was taken from Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre in Bedfordshire to Heathrow airport, her school and MP said. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, wrote to the Home Secretary to ask her to "urgently reconsider'' the decision to deport the A–level student. Ms Bageerathi, whose case prompted a petition that has attracted around 175,000 signatures, has been detained since March 19. A Home Office spokesman said: "We consider every claim for asylum on its individual merits and in this case the applicant was not considered to be in need of protection.''
