JOBLESS immigrants flocking to Britain to scrounge state handouts are costing hard-up taxpayers £10million a year.
Around 3,000 European "benefit tourists" are living rent-free after pocketing £100 each week in housing handouts.
More than half continue to make claims for at least six months on average and more than a third for longer than a year.
The figures, published by the Department of Work and Pensions, paint a damning picture of how Britain's welfare system is being exploited.
It is based on a 12-month period between 2011 and 2012.
Work and Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, said: "It is simply not right that migrants were able to receive taxpayers' money in the form of housing benefit without having first made a contribution to the country.
"The British public are rightly concerned about preventing abuse of the system and expect government to ensure that support is focused on those who work hard and contribute, rather than those who don't and may have no intention of doing so.
"That is exactly what we are doing."
The government expects to save £70m by 2019 by adopting a tougher approach, although it will only apply to new arrivals.
Prime Minister David Cameron has spoken of his desire to halt "free movement" for migrants across Europe after coming under increasing pressure from Ukip rivals to take a stronger stance on immigration.
