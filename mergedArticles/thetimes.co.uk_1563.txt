Theresa May risks being accused of massaging immigration statistics with a small reduction to the maximum stay allowed to low-skilled workers.
The Home Office is pushing through changes to the visa regime that will at a stroke reduce immigration figures by almost 20,000 a year. The number of foreign workers brought to Britain by companies to plug skills gaps on short-term visas reached 19,052 last year. As these visas last for 12 months, they count towards the annual net immigration total, which David Cameron promised to reduce to “tens of thousands”.
In the year to September, net immigration rose to 212,000, up almost a third from 154,000 the previous year.
The Home Office confirmed yesterday that it was to reduce the maximum stay for Intra-Company Transfer short-term visas to under 12 months, effectively removing them from the total.
“We are seeking cross-government agreement to a number of proposals which would make the immigration system work more effectively,” a spokesman said.
