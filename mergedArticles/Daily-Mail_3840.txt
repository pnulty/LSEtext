THE National Front is leading opinion polls before France's European elections next month.
According to the latest survey, the far-Right party led by Marine Le Pen is predicted to take 24 per cent of the vote.
President Francois Hollande's Socialist Party has the support of just 20 per cent while the centre-Right UMP opposition is backed by 22 per cent.
The polls follow a big swing to the Right in local elections, which led to the Socialist government resigning this month.
Mr Hollande has since appointed a new administration.
The National Front's gains in areas of high unemployment and immigration were hailed by Miss Le Pen as 'a huge victory'.
She believes her party will do even better in the European elections - a result that would humiliate Mr Hollande. Miss Le Pen has allegedly modernised the party, moving it away from its racist and anti-Semitic roots.
