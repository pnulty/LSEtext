Two cities the size of Leeds will be needed to house new migrants over the next ten years, according to parliamentary research.
A study of figures has found that during the next decade migrants will be responsible for one in three new households formed in England.
Research by the House of Commons library estimates that migrants will form 629,000 new households based on net immigration running at 144,000 a year up to 2021.
The research estimates that 1.4 million migrants will come to England between 2012 and 2022, although the figure may be lower because the Home Secretary, Theresa May, has pledged to reduce net migration — the difference between those arriving and those leaving — to under 100,000 by the time of the next general election.
Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of MigrationWatch UK, which campaigns for lower immigration, said: “It is entirely logical that mass migration will have an impact on house prices. If you get demand going up while supply remains stationary, house prices will rise."
James Clappison, the Conservative MP for Hertsmere, who requested the research, said: “If we are going to keep control of household formation we need to keep a tight grip on immigration."
Carlos Vargas-Silva, a senior researcher at the University of Oxford’s Migration Observatory, said migrants could push up house prices because they were likely to increase rental costs, and boost the buy-to-let market, meaning fewer houses would be for sale.
