THE BBC needs to kick out many more of its managers, says its star broadcaster John Humphrys.
The host of Radio 4's flagship Today programme says: "There are too many.
"I think they think that. I think Tony Hall (BBC director general) thinks that - I don't know, I haven't asked him but I think he thinks that. Over the years we've been grotesquely over-managed, there's no question. They're now getting a grip on it.
A lot have gone and I think more need to go."
Humphrys, 70, cites some of the bigger payoffs, "to people who shouldn't have had them" as an example of money mismanagement within the corporation.
"You look at your own programme and you think, 'We could have done with that'. More resources should be devoted to Today. We're as pared down as it's possible to get," he tells Radio Times.
Humphrys, who joined the BBC in 1966 as a reporter in Liverpool, thinks that only now are we seeing fair BBC debates on immigration.
"The BBC has tended over the years to be broadly liberal as opposed to broadly conservative for all sorts of perfectly understandable reasons. We weren't sufficiently sceptical - that's the most accurate phrase - of the pro-European case.
"We bought into the European ideal. We didn't look at the potential negatives with sufficient rigour."
