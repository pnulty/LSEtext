EU just couldn't make it up. This camping firm billboard saying 'No Poles Required' was the victim of some serious bad placement — after being put up next to a Ukip poster.
The Go Outdoors promo was spotted in Edinburgh beside the ad for Nigel Farage's party, which has spent thousands claiming Brits are being cheated out of work by immigrants. Charity worker Willie Dunn, who took a snap of the gaffe, said: "I almost crashed when I saw it."
Billboard firm Clear Channel said both ads were put up at the same time — but wouldn't now be changed as "it's not our place to censor".
