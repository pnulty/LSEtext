THE BOOK OF MY LIVES by ALEKSANDAR HEMON Picador £8.99/ebook £6.99 A safety warning: do not read the final chapter of The Book of My Lives. This advice is particularly serious if you are a parent of young children. The chapter concerns the illness of the author's baby daughter, and it will render you torrential. If you read all but this final episode, you will still have enjoyed a rare experience — a deft, playful, poignant memoir by a writer of supreme grace and restraint.
Aleksandar Hemon was born in Sarajevo, in the former Yugoslavia, in 1964. He arrived in Chicago in 1992 at the outset of the siege of his home city, and published his first story in English in 1995. Four years later, he had his work printed in The New Yorker.
It should come as no surprise, then, that Hemon has written an outstanding memoir. As he learns to love his new city, his experiences become rich and joyful. Discussing the games of football he plays with other immigrants, he settles his gaze briefly on a 75-year-old Italian team-mate named Lido, and the writing enters a high comic state.
Nearly every chapter in this extraordinary memoir contains characters such as Lido who walk, three-dimensional, from the page. And then there is that final episode, which you shouldn't read — unless you wish to understand the damage that nonfiction can wreak when delivered by a writer as sharp as a diamond drill-bit.
