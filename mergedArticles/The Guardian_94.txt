The first Syrian refugees have arrived in the UK under the government's scheme to take in some of the most vulnerable victims of the conflict.
It is thought that 10-20 people arrived yesterday, although several hundred are expected to come to the UK over the next three years under the vulnerable persons relocation (VPR) scheme. More are due to arrive next month.
Following pressure from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and some Conservative backbenchers, the government dropped opposition to admitting refugees directly from the region, and eight weeks ago announced the scheme in conjunction with the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR.
Syrian refugees under the scheme will have all rights and benefits that go with "humanitarian protection" status, including access to public funds and to the labour market and the possibility of family reunion. A number of local authorities are supporting the scheme.
The immigration minister, James Brokenshire, said: "We believe this . . . scheme will make a real difference to the lives of some of the most vulnerable Syrians by giving them protection and support in the UK."
However, there have been warnings that many Syrian asylum seekers already here are faring less well. Since the beginning of the conflict, around 3,800 Syrians have arrived in the UK independently and claimed asylum. According to Home Office figures, between 2011 and 2013 just under 2,000 were granted leave to remain. Many more are still waiting for an answer.
More than 2.5 million refugees have now fled the conflict and as a result the UNHCR is calling on governments around the world to help resettle 130,000 people over the next three years.
