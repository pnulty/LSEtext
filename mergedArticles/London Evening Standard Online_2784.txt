David Cameron's flagship pledge to cut immigration was in tatters today after dramatic new figures showed a net influx of 212,000 migrants into Britain in just 12 months.
The new total, driven by a sharp increase in those arriving from other EU countries, is more than double the Prime Minister’s target of cutting net migration to below 100,000 by the next election.
The figure is also close to the record levels of immigration seen under Labour and represents a 38 per cent increase on the previous annual tally.
It comes despite a series of controversial government reforms which are designed to curb the flow but which  university and business leaders claim are damaging the country’s long-term prospects.
The rise was partly driven by a sharp increase in numbers of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens coming to Britain — a surge of 166 per cent from 9,000 to 24,000 year-on-year.
Campaigners and political opponents called on the Prime Minister to admit defeat as the surprise statistics heaped new pressure on him. Mark Hilton, head of immigration policy at business group London First, said the figures were  “game over" for the Government’s immigration target.
“What we need to be wary of is the Government trying to control future figures by further limiting the only number over which it has power — non-EU migrants," he said.
“In the past this has hit both highly-skilled immigrants we need, as well as foreign students — who are a huge economic asset. Higher education is our eighth biggest export industry, at £8 billion."

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, said it was “totally unrealistic" for Mr Cameron to expect to hit his net migration target.
He added: “The Prime Minister should never have made this pledge because you cannot control the number of people who leave the country." Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: “The Government’s target is holed below the water. When you operate with totally open borders to poorer countries in south and east Europe it’s totally pointless to make any estimate of what immigration figures may be as it’s out of our control."
There was also criticism from Tories, with backbencher John Baron calling on ministers to “revisit" free movement within the EU, which he described as the “elephant in the room".
But immigration minister James  Brokenshire defended the Government approach.
He said ministers had cut net migration from outside Europe and were determined to curb the “abuse of free movement" between EU states.
Today’s Office for National Statistics figures cover the 12 months to the end of last September and reveal 532,000 people arrived from overseas in that period, 35,000 up on the previous year. A total of 320,000 people departed, giving a net migration total of 212,000, dramatically up on the 154,000 in the comparable 12 months a year earlier.
The key factor was a 60,000 rise in the net inflow of citizens from other EU countries. These included the extra 15,000 Romanians and Bulgarians, who arrived before the lifting of controls at the end of 2013.
But there were also an extra 23,000 arrivals from EU members such as Spain, Italy and Portugal in an apparent reflection of their poor jobs markets. Immigration from countries outside Europe, such as India, Pakistan and African nations, fell by 25,000, mainly due to a drop in student numbers.
Non-EU countries still account for the bulk of the net influx into the UK, with 141,000 more of their citizens arriving than departing.
The report says work is the main reason people migrate here, with 218,000 arrivals for this reason last year. An- other 176,000 came to study, while 66,000 arrived to join relatives.
