I''ve often wondered why the people of the lower Newtownards Road carry around bags of excrement.
Sam_Mildanach: That''s not very nice. I''ve walked through that area many times and have never encountered anyone carrying a bag of excrement. The vast majority of people who live down there are decent people. There is a small hoodlum element, but to suggest it is the culture of all those who live there is, simply put, unfair. Bigbearagain Sam_Mildanach: What a ridiculous statement. That''s like saying all people with the surname Savile are child molesters. Death Warmed Up Disgusting yob. Hope the victim can ID him. What law would he be charged under? Is there a distinct upward trend in racist incidents since last year? Or are the PSNI describing more crimes as race crimes in their new reporting systems? Turquoisetree53: Can''t speak for the current period, as the figures don''t appear to be published yet, but it is not a result of police recording practices. The current trend does seem to be upwards, specifically in loyalist areas, such as east Belfast. Coupled with another attack on the Alliance office, it would seem to be an exercise in gaining a stranglehold on areas by shadowy paramilitaries. Easynow21 Considering that part of the city is to host the Giro d''Italia, it''s just showing up how some areas areas bad as ever. They haven''t moved on and are being taught immigrants and outsiders are not welcome in their small, bigoted world. Daddy Pobbin I suppose, when you are above the law, why not? I''m sure local politicians will do nothing. Belfast Boyo
