DAVID Cameron told supporters today that the Tories are "building a Great British revival".
In an email to party members to mark the one-year countdown to the general election next May 7, the Prime Minister says: "For each of those 365 days, the Conservatives have one clear message - we are the team that is turning Britain around.
"We have set out a serious, long-term economic plan: reducing the deficit, cutting income taxes, backing business, capping welfare, reducing immigration, delivering the best schools and skills - and that plan is working for families across our country.
"From the ashes of the Great Recession we are building a Great British revival."
"Labour's only plans are for more spending, more borrowing, more debt - more of the same that got us into the mess".
