From Mr Robert Cooper.
Sir, Another excellent article by Janan Ganesh ("At last Miliband impresses with leadership, not swagger", March 15). But he lost me with the sentence: "Britons are entitled to have a say when there is something to have a say on."
To what else does this constitutional principle apply? Immigration, the death penalty, energy prices (there is a precedent in California), invading foreign countries?
Perhaps Mr Ganesh could one day write us an article explaining how it has happened that the political class has so lost confidence in its legitimacy, and in that of parliament, that they feel a need to resort to the referendum, a device that Margaret Thatcher (quoting Clement Attlee) described as "a splendid weapon for demagogues and dictators".
