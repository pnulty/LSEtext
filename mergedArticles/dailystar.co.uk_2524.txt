MIGRANTS have set up one in seven of all British companies.
And nearly half a million people from 155 countries have launched businesses here.
The Centre for Entrepreneurs think tank said their contribution to Britain was “breath-taking".
Overall, 14% of jobs in small and medium sized enterprises are created by foreigners.
Business information experts DueDil carried out the research with the CfE. While just 10.4% of people born in the UK start a business here, 17.2% of migrants in Britain have started their own company.
They are also younger, with migrant entrepreneurs 44.3 years old on average compared to 52.1 for those born in the UK.
Matt Smith, CfE director
DueDil founder Damian Kimmelman, himself an American, said: “This game-changing research proves that migrant entrepreneurs are hyper-productive, net contributors to the UK economy."
Successful firms highlighted included Caffè Nero, whose chief executive Dr Gerry Ford is from the US.
CfE director Matt Smith said: “The contribution of migrant entrepreneurs is, to be frank, breath-taking."
Chairman Luke Johnson added: “The majority of the public appreciate the value of migrant entrepreneurs, yet our politicians and media send out negative signals that risk alienating this vital group of job creators."
