The latest numbers show that the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK has fallen since immigration restrictions were lifted in January
Today the latest employment figures were announced, and guess what? It seems like Romanians and Bulgarians aren't as good at stealing jobs as some have been claiming (we're looking at you, Nigel).
When restrictions on immigration from the two countries were lifted at the start of the year, some of the numbers being thrown around suggested that some sort of immigrant apocalypse was imminent.
One Ukip MEP estimated 1.5m Romanians would be flocking to the UK. The think tank Migrant Watch estimated that 50,000 would be entering the country every year once the gates were opened.
A Ukip leaflet distributed last year implied that it could be even more. "The EU will allow 29 million Bulgarians and Romanians to come to the UK," it said.
And according to one poster put out by the party recently, 26m Europeans are all after your job. Yes, you - your job! I'd give your HR department a heads up - that's a lot of cover letters.
However, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the number of Romanians and Bulgarians in the UK work force has actually dropped since border controls were lifted on January.
In the last quarter of 2013, there were 144,000 employed in the UK, while there are now 140,000 - a decrease of 4,000.
There was actually a much greater increase in the first quarter of 2013, when the restrictions were still in place.
