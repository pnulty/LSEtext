Three Pounds in My Pocket
Radio 4, 11am
The majority of the pioneering Indian immigrants who came to Britain in the 1950s arrived with as little as £3 — an extremely meagre amount enforced by the Indian authorities — with which to start a new life. It was a time where the country needed workers for its factories, foundries, and new public services in order to boost the postwar economy. In this three-part series, Kavita Puri hears the stories of the "£3 generation", including that of her father, Ravi.
Ravel Day
Radio 3, from midday
Today Radio 3 clears its entire schedule to focus on Maurice Ravel, he of the stirring Bolero. At midday, there is a live concert from Wigmore Hall, where the Nash Ensemble play some of his best-known chamber works, while at 1.10pm, Roy Howat joins Sara Mohr-Pietsch, above, and Tom Service to talk about Ravel's piano compositions and to play a couple of the composer's miniatures. The highlight is A Ravel Soirée (7.30pm), an evening of live music, guests and recordings of some of his last works including the Piano Concerto for the Left Hand and the Don Quichotte songs.
