BRITAIN'S changing face was highlighted last night as official figures showed that nearly half of all children who joined a town's primary schools in a year had English as a second language.
The statistics for Bolton, Greater Manchester, came from its Labour-run council, which provides cash via a "growth fund" to help schools deal with a growing population.
Figures for the scheme show an annual intake of 779 primary pupils for 2012-2013. And 387 had a first language other than English. The total number of primary children in the town with English as an additional language is now 3,841. Only last week the Daily Express revealed that patriotic councillors in Bolton voted to encourage schools to fly the Union Flag and sing the national anthem as a way of helping immigrants integrate.
Tory councillor Mudasir Dean, 42, said the language problem "will put a strain on the local education budget".
He added: "More should be done to encourage parents coming into the country to support children growing up to learn English."
But council chiefs said the figures were "not unusual".
