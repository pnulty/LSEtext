TWO Popes have been made into saints but there are many less prominent souls whose saintly acts deserve recognition and one is Stephen Sutton, the 19-year-old terminal cancer victim who has raised more than £3million for the Teenage Cancer Trust.
His efforts will benefit many other sufferers more than himself, altruism of the highest order. 
Stephen deserves at least an MBE if not a knighthood. He has done as much to warrant such an award as any Olympic medal winner and a great deal more than many of the time servers who crowd the honours lists year after year. 
The Teenage Cancer Trust fills an important gap creating hospital environments especially designed for a group largely ignored by the NHS. Its champion is The Who’s lead singer Roger Daltrey who has campaigned for years and raised huge amounts. 
I believe Daltrey should be in the House of Lords. He is a tremendously caring man who talks a lot of sense. He would be an asset to an institution that badly needs new blood untainted by political patronage.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage [GETTY]
The continuing rise of Ukip doesn’t necessarily mean the majority of Britons want to quit the European Union. Most voters are showing they want the EU to change, to go into reverse. 
They want the Common Market as it was originally sold to us, a simple trading partnership between sovereign nations with none of the baggage of a political superstate. 
They want Britain to make its own decisions, its own laws, its own friends, decide its own borders and immigration policy, all powers it has handed over to unelected officials. 
I’m sure all the peoples of Europe want the same but their leaders are hell-bent on creating a monster. Then they wonder why no one loves them.
..........................................................................................................
Another monster no one wants is HS2, the high-speed rail link between North and South. Opinion is growing against the £50billion plan but its backers won’t lose face and admit it’s a dud. 
What grounds are there for believing that cutting journey times by half an hour or even longer will revitalise vast areas of the North? Few will be able to afford the fares anyway. The scheme should be shunted into a siding.

The mother accused of murdering her three disabled children is one of the most harrowing cases to go before a court and I question whether she should be in a court so soon. 
Tania Clarence is alleged to have killed three-year-old twins Ben and Max and Olivia, four, and has been remanded in custody. All the children were suffering from a genetic condition. 
We don’t know all the facts but this mother must be in unbearable torment. Shouldn’t her state of mind have been assessed and treatment given before she was hauled into court? Someone has shown a lamentable lack of sympathy.

English novelist Dame Daphne du Maurier in 1947 [GETTY]
Like millions of Daphne du Maurier fans I looked forward to watching Jamaica Inn on the BBC. If I start a book I finish it and I’ve only walked out of a play once but I gave up on this after manfully enduring two episodes. 
Not only was it too muffled to hear and too dark to see, some of the acting was pure ham. Sean Harris, who played drunken Uncle Joss, was previously seen as an assassin in The Borgias and he certainly murdered poor Daphne du Maurier. 
Her writing was traduced by the critics while she was alive and now she’s been let down by the BBC. She must be revolving in her grave.

Ed Miliband has had a Neil Kinnock moment urging Scotland not to leave the UK because he’s “increasingly confident” of being prime minister next May. “We are just one Christmas away from having a Labour government,” he told Radio Scotland.
If I were living in Scotland that thought would make my mind up. I’d get my kilt on and volunteer to help SNP leader Alex Salmond rebuild Hadrian’s Wall. 
..........................................................................................................
As If the prospect of a Miliband government isn’t depressing enough how about 10 more years of Nick Clegg? He says he wants another decade as deputy prime minister to continue his crusade to annoy everyone.
Power has knocked Clegg completely off his head. If David Cameron says anything Clegg automatically trots out the opposite: Cameron urges us to be more Christian, Clegg tells the Queen to step down as head of the Church.
But now we have Team Clegg. As the Lib Dem leader lectured men last week that family life was more important than work his Spanish wife Miriam suggested men who spent more time at home had more “cojones”. 
It has long been suspected that behind Clegg was a woman of steel and now we know where she’s got him: by the…

Britons who fight alongside the rebels in Syria will be arrested by counterterrorism police when they return home but hang on, it’s not that long ago the Prime Minister wanted to give support to the anti-Assad forces and send RAF planes to bomb the dictator. 
As far as we know that’s still Government policy so I suggest Messrs Cameron, Osborne and Hague surrender themselves at the nearest police station. They are bang to rights on charges of double standards, hypocrisy and being in charge of a country without knowing what the hell they are doing.
