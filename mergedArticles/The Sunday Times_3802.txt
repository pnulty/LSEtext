Swimwear maker Zoggs eyes sale
Zoggs, the maker of swimming goggles and trunks, could soon change hands, writes Matthew Goodman.
The brand has hired McQueen, a corporate finance specialist, to review options for the business. These include a sale, bringing in new investors, or pursuing acquisitions.
For the past decade Zoggs has been owned by Kendal Group, an investment vehicle controlled by brothers Daniel and Leo Gestetner. The business delivered sales of almost £18m in the 12 months to March last year, the most recent period for which accounts are publicly available.
The brothers are descendants of David Gestetner, a Hungarian immigrant who built up an eponymous copying machine business.
As well as swimwear, Daniel's business interests include a newly launched diner being run in partnership with Tesco and called Fred's Food Construction. It recently opened its first branch in west London.
