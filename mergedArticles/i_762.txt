A proposal to auction British visas to millionaire bidders would cause public anger and damage the country's reputation abroad, ministers were warned last night.
They are considering a shake-up of the system which allows super-rich foreign nationals to settle in Britain following claims it could be modified to boost investment in this country.
One option to be set out today by the Government's migration advisory committee (MAC) is that a number of visas are set aside each year to be auctioned to the highest bidders. At the moment applicants for "investor visas" pay between £1m and £10m to create a fast-track route to permission to live permanently in Britain. Those who pay £10m can gain the right to residency in two years.
However, Sir David Metcalfe, the head of the MAC, has signalled his determination to overhaul the system, arguing most investors buy government gilts which they later sell, meaning there is little lasting benefit to the British economy.
Some Whitehall officials are sympathetic to the scheme. One official told i: "A lot of these people are very high-worth individuals. Perhaps we can be more demanding of them."
But immigration lawyers urged the Home Office and Department for Business to resist the proposal.
Julia Onslow-Cole, head of global immigration at PwC Legal, said: "In the current climate I don't think it would sit very well with the public."
Although the Home Office did not comment last night, it is expected to veto the auction plan.
Just over 500 investor visas were issued in 2012-13, an increase of some 25 per cent on the previous 12 months. The largest number went to Chinese nationals, followed by Russians and Americans.
