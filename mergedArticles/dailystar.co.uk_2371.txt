WILL FERRELL and JOHN C. REILLY are teaming up on the big screen for a third time in a new comedy.
The duo previously collaborated on hit films Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby and Step Brothers, and now they are joining forces once again on Boarder Guards.
According to Deadline.com, Ferrell and Reilly are set to play hapless friends who decide their new purpose in life is to protect America's boarders from illegal immigrants attempting to enter the country.
However, the pair end up stranded in Mexico without proper identification and must find a way back to the U.S.
The film will be directed by Anchorman filmmaker Adam McKay.
