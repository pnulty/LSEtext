850 foreign crims stay on in UK jails AFTER serving time
MORE than 850 foreign lags are being kept in jail beyond the end of their sentence — costing taxpayers £34million a year. Figures show the prisoners spend an average 234 days extra behind bars as many use human rights laws to challenge their deportations.
A total of 145 have been locked up for more than a year longer than they should.
And ten have been there for more than FIVE YEARS extra.
The figures were laid bare by the Home Office in a Commons written answer to shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan. He said: "Jails are seriously overcrowded.
Yet 850 foreign criminals who could be deported are clogging up prisons because of this Government's incompetence." The average prison place costs £40,000 a year.
Home Office minister James Brokenshire insisted every effort was being made to kick out the lags at the end of their sentence.
He said: "Where a detainee refuses to co-operate with the removal or deportation process, detention may be prolonged."
The Immigration Bill, sent for Royal Assent this week, aims to simplify the appeals system and speed up deportations, he added.
Last month a report for MPs found 1,000 foreign offenders are deported every three months — almost the same as those convicted in the same period.
This means the number of foreign lags stays around 11,000 — or 13 per cent of the prison population. emily.ashton@the-sun.co.uk The Sun Says — Page Six
