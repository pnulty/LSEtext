DAVID CAMERON has insisted that he can meet a key election pledge to cut immigration, despite figures showing a surge to levels not seen since 2011.
The Prime Minister's comments were immediately undermined by Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, who said the target was "unworkable".
Mr Cable, a Liberal Democrat, said the pledge – to restrict net migration to "tens of thousands" a year – was a Conservative–led policy that "contradicts our aims of getting Britain back on its feet".
Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed net migration – the difference between those coming into Britain and those leaving – rose by a third in the 12 months to the end of September to 212,000, compared with 154,000 the previous year.
It was driven by an increase in migrants from European Union countries.
One commentator said it was "game over" for Mr Cameron's immigration pledge. Nigel Farage, the UK Independence Party leader, said EU free movement rules left ministers powerless to control Britain's borders.
Mr Cameron's official spokesman said achieving the election pledge remained "the objective". He said: "We are putting in place what we believe are the right measures that go towards meeting that objective. That is what we are going to work towards."
However, Mr Cable said any quota on migration was unworkable, a comment bound to infuriate Downing Street.
He also said any quota "contradicts our aims of getting Britain back on its feet".
Data on National Insurance numbers allocated to foreigners – a key indicator of immigration trends – showed a 19 per cent rise to 617,000 last year. Of those 440,000 came from within the EU.
The number of Italians registering rose 66 per cent year–on–year to 44,000, with other countries showing further large increases including Portugal, up 47 per cent to 30,000, and Spain, up 36 per cent to just under 52,000.
The number of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens coming to Britain in the 12 months to the end of September jumped 166 per cent year–on–year to from 9,000 to 24,000 – a steep rise even before restrictions on their access to the British job market were lifted on Jan 1.
Arrivals from Poland also saw a 39 per cent increase from 80,000 to 111,000.
Mark Hilton, of the business organisation London First, said it was "game over" for the Tory immigration target.
He said: "What we need to be wary of is the Government trying to control future figures by further limiting the only number it has power over – non–EU migrants."
Mr Farage, the Ukip leader, said the figures showed Government limits on immigration were out of control.
"Until we end the open–door immigration policy with the EU and take back full control over our borders, nothing can really be done – it's all smoke and mirrors," he said.
James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, highlighted aspects of the figures which showed fewer people from outside the EU came to Britain last year.
He said: "Our reforms have cut non–EU migration to its lowest level since 1998 and there are now 82,000 fewer people arriving annually from outside the EU than when this government came to power."
