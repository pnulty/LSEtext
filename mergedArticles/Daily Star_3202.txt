UKIP leader Nigel Farage has defended his party's immigration policy and said it was an insult to think of British youngsters as "lazy".
Mr Farage said his party is not anti-immigration, claiming it was only against "uncontrolled immigration".
He said: "Providing refuge for skilled migrants who want to work hard and be part of society is not what Ukip has a problem with.
"Also, it is an insult to our youngsters that politicians think they are lazy and we need migrants to pick fruit.
"Before 2004 strawberries did not go rotting in the field as feckless 18-year-olds pointed and laughed."
