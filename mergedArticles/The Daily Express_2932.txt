THE idea of everyone paying Â£120 a year to belong to the NHS is preposterous. Unsurprisingly the idea is dreamed up by a former Labour health minister to try to tackle the crisis caused in part by the massive increase in immigration his party brought about.
Anyone who's been in a hospital knows two things: the staff are brilliant and the system's rubbish. The amount of waste is staggering and if those with vested interests such as unions, bureaucrats and, yes, doctors would agree to widespread reforms there'd be no need to think about charging.
At the same time as this idea is being aired a survey of MPs finds that nearly half agree that a free NHS will be unsustainable if pressing problems are not tackled - though with their salaries and gold-plated pensions will they be unduly concerned?
