Worrying about immigration is not prejudice, Ed Miliband has said. But the Labour leader also said he would not give "false promises" such as setting a target to cut net immigration.
He admitted his party had too often turned its back on concerns about immigration. The remarks signal a Labour decision to readdress immigration in the final days of campaigning before Thursday's local and European elections.
He said: "We will never again turn our backs on people who are worried about immigration. But neither will we turn our back on the rest of the world."
Miliband said the election was the most unpredictable in a generation, and he had long known immigration was "a big issue on the doorstep".
His party had been on a journey on the issue, he told Airbus workers in North Wales. "I don't believe it is prejudiced to worry about immigration. We said people needed to change their attitudes. But in fact, we needed to change ours."
Britons, he said, "worry about the entitlements people have when they come here and the pressure it might put on the system". However, in a BBC World at One interview, he said he opposed the government's target of getting net immigration down to 100,000, and rejected blocking free movement of workers in the EU.
