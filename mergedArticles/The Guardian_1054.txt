The home secretary, Theresa May, has won backing for her controversial plan to strip naturalised British terror suspects of their UK passports after it was revised following last-minute negotiations with the Liberal Democrats.
The details were revealed in a leaked letter to Lib Dem MPs from Home Office minister Norman Baker, who pleaded with them not to vote against the revised package despite concerns that it would leave people stateless. "If colleagues really feel uncomfortable, and I hope you now don't, then I would ask you to abstain," he told them.
In the letter leaked to the Spectator website, Baker told his colleagues that he shared the view that there was a point of principle at stake but argued that new safeguards represented "a major shift from the home secretary".
The two new safeguards will mean that the home secretary will not be able to take away British citizenship from somebody they "reasonably believe" will be unable to secure an alternative passport from another country.
The concessions were enough to secure May a 66-strong majority when the Commons voted to overturn a Lords amendment to the immigration bill. Only one Lib Dem MP, Sarah Teather, and two Conservatives, Richard Shepherd and David Davis, voted against the government. Alan Travis
