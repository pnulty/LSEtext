The deportation of a promising A-level student to Mauritius must go ahead before she can finish her exams despite a parliamentary committee's appeal for compassion, the immigration minister, James Brokenshire, said yesterday.
Brokenshire, appearing before the Commons home affairs select committee, refused to intervene in Yashika Bageerathi's case, saying it was not sufficiently exceptional.
Bageerathi's mother, who sat sobbing behind Brokenshire, pleaded for her daughter to be released from Yarl's Wood detention centre, saying it was "a place that is cruel".
Supporters of Bageerathi, 19, have been campaigning for a reprieve since she was detained on 19 March and threatened with deportation without her mother and two siblings, who live with her in the UK. Kevin Rawlinson
