YVETTE Cooper was branded 'brass-necked beyond belief' last night after complaining about the number of migrants in Britain.
The shadow home secretary said she was 'concerned' about the level of 'cheap migrant labour' from Eastern European countries.
Miss Cooper, who was a minister for more than a decade in the last Labour government, also claimed she did not want Britain to be 'dependent' on migrant workers.
The speech appeared to suggest Labour is taking a more sceptical approach on immigration, which is consistently among voters' top concerns. But Tory MPs demanded she apologise for Labour's mistakes.
James Clappison, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: 'It was her government that has prime responsibility for the number of Eastern European migrants in Britain because they failed to impose transitional controls?...?This is brass-necked beyond belief.'
MigrationWatch's Sir Andrew Green said Miss Cooper's speech hid 'the absence of any real policy' on cutting migrant numbers.
