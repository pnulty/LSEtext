Dramatic increase in number of eastern Europeans registering for National Insurance numbers
More than 200,000 people moved to Britain from the European Union last year, up 22 per cent on 2012, according to official figures.
There has also been a dramatic increase in the number of Eastern Europeans registering for National Insurance numbers, a sign that more are finding legal work and paying taxes. The most significant increase was amongst Polish workers, with 102,000 joining the official workforce last year, up by 11,000 on 2012.
Overall migration numbers showed no statistically significant change, with 526,000 people moving to the UK in the year ending December 2013, up from 498,000 the previous year.
Net migration - the difference between the numbers leaving and arriving in Britain - rose to 212,000, from 177,000 in 2012. The figure means David Cameron’s target of bringing net migration below 100,000 by the general election in 2015 is looking even more distant.
The increase was partly because fewer people left the UK last year, with 314,000 people emigrating in 2013, compared to 321,000 in the previous year.
