THE NORTHERN & SHELL BUILDING NUMBER 10 LOWER THAMES STREET, LONDON EC3R 6EN Tel: 0208 612 7000 (outside UK: +44 208 612 7000)
HARROW COUNCIL'S decision to use a plane fitted with thermal imaging equipment to detect illegal structures in back gardens used to house exploited immigrants has provided some shocking findings.
The so called "beds in sheds" were discovered to be four times more prevalent than the concerned council in North west London had initially thought.
This newspaper has repeatedly warned that Britain does not have the infrastructure to cope with the huge influx of new migrants. There are 4,000 people in Harrow alone already on the waiting list for social housing.
This has provided an opportunity for renegade landlords to create these small scale shanty towns that are dangerous, unsightly and inhumane.
The whole situation is drastically unfair on the rest of Harrow's residents who are being forced to endure criminality right on their doorsteps.
