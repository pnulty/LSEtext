EMPLOYERS engaging in 'wholesale' exploitation of illegal migrant workers would face automatic jail terms under a Labour government, Yvette Cooper will pledge today.
The shadow home secretary will call for minimum custodial terms for sweatshop owners and gangmasters who base their business on employing illegal immigrants.
She will admit Labour let too many migrants in by abandoning controls on Eastern Europeans in 2004. And in a sign the party is hardening its policy on migration, she will reject an attitude which 'treats all immigration as good and ignores the unfair impact and consequences of different kinds of immigration'.
She will also pledge to stop employers 'exploiting cheap migrant labour to undercut local jobs and wages'.
Current laws mean criminals face an unlimited fine or jail for two years if found guilty of large-scale employment of illegal immigrants. But in many cases they escape with a lesser sentence.
Miss Cooper will say: 'As we've said, the last Labour government got things wrong on immigration?...?The figures were wrong, and migration was far greater than we expected?...?And we should have recognised more quickly the impact on low skilled jobs and the worries people had.'
But she will also say the Government's approach 'isn't working' and point to the recent rise in net migration by 60,000 to 210,000.
David Cameron had pledged to cut the figure to the 'tens of thousands' by next year's election.
