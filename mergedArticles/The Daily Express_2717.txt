RESEARCH by the pressure group Migration Watch has predicted that 500,000 immigrants will arrive in the United Kingdom from the EU over the next five years - which is exceptionally bad news for Prime Minister David Cameron, who has promised to lower immigration levels to the "tens of thousands" by the 2015 general election.
To its credit, the Government has actually managed to drive down the number of immigrants coming to this country from outside the EU, because we still have the right to prevent those people from entering. But this notable achievement has been massively outweighed by the sheer scale of the influx from Europe, which doubled in 2013, and Migration Watch predicts that the "large flow" of migrants from Eastern Europe will continue for some time to come.
As Sir Andrew Green correctly says: "It was crazy to have opened up our labour market and our benefit system to one hundred million people from countries with a standard of living less than a quarter of our own." In Spain, Italy and Portugal, appallingly high levels of youth unemployment will also prompt many nationals to come here in search of work.
The fact is, that until we leave the EU, Britain we will never be able to get a grip on excessive immigration.
