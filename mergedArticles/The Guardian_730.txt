Call It Dog
by Marli Roode (Atlantic, pounds 8.99)
Marli Roode, a young writer who grew up in South Africa, is of a generation that has inherited its history and the opportunity (or burden) of transforming it into a new reality. Her debut novel tells a story that is disquieting and compelling, announcing an astute and gifted observer. Jo, a South African-born, London-based journalist has come home to report on anti-immigrant urban riots. When she answers a summons from her estranged father, Nico, it soon becomes evident that something is badly wrong. Nico is on the run, accused of the murder of a black man abducted by special forces during the height of the fight against apartheid and never seen again. Father and daughter embark on a road trip to locations related to the crime and to Nico's past. Is he seeking to prove his innocence? Is Jo his companion, accomplice or captive? Just what does Nico want from his daughter? In the end, all we have left is a truth that is elided, ghost-written and scribbled over until the realisation dawns that whatever the story, it is only the future that we have any chance of shaping.
