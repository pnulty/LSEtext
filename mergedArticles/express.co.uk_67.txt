FOLLOWING the positive reception for the pension reforms announced in the Budget last week the Conservatives seem to have taken on board the fact that the British much prefer having control of their own money rather than handing it over to the Government.
This is reflected in promises from David Cameron that if his party wins the general election the inheritance tax threshold will be increased.
The tax will raise £24.3billion over the next five years, far more than anticipated especially given that – as Mr Cameron himself says – “inheritance tax should only really be paid by the rich”.
In 2006 this newspaper began a crusade which saw 360,000 readers register their hatred of inheritance tax.
Since then the Government has been taking a slice of increasing numbers of states as soaring property prices boosted their value above the current threshold of £325,000. 
Fury at the duty has continued to grow.
Before the 2010 election the Tories had promised to increase the threshold to £1million only to have that pledge quietly dropped during coalition negotiations with the Lib Dems – which disappointed many. 
A Conservative majority in 2015 would give them a chance to finally deliver on that promise.

Germany can, we can too
EVERY single day the British taxpayer hands out benefits to immigrants thereby encouraging scroungers from across the EU to come here and take advantage of the State’s generosity.
When Angela Merkel visited Britain in February benefit tourism was high on the agenda for her talks with David Cameron. 
Now proposals from the German government have been revealed showing how they plan to tackle the issue. 
The measures include powers toscreen immigrants to assess their chances of finding work, the deportation of migrants found guilty of benefit fraud and the provision of child support only to those who pay tax.
If Germany – shackled in theory by the same EU rules as Britain – can make these strides in addressing their immigrant problem then why can’t we do it too? Ultimately these moves don’t go far enough, but it would be a start.

Pocket money bonanza
IT IS good news that inflation has dropped to 1.7 per cent and could fall further in the coming months. 
Yet there is one group in society who will not be unduly worried about the inflation rate – children. 
With pocket money rising by a whopping 211 per cent during the last 20 years Britain’s kids are better off than ever.
