EXCLUSIVE
AT least 30 desperate migrants make a bolt for Britain across the Channel every night trying to reach "the promised land".
They are prepared to die getting from Calais by stowing away on freight trucks – or even attempting the Channel Tunnel on foot.
And many do die, with four migrants believed to have been killed in the past week.
The Daily Express can reveal that waves of refugees have swelled the population of a makeshift camp near the ferry terminal in the French port to around 500.
Squalid
Last night, the bottleneck in Calais was blamed on Britain's "broken open–door immigration policy".
The disease–ridden tent city – dubbed "Sangatte II" – evokes memories of the original camp near the Channel Tunnel terminal, where illegal immigrants gathered and rioted before it was closed in 2002.
Inside the filthy camp, professionals from war–ravaged countries such as Syria, Sudan, Iran and Pakistan live alongside the penniless. Each travelled thousands of miles to make a bid to get to the UK, just 21 miles over the water. Afghan Khanabid, 18, told how he paid £1,200 to escape his homeland and has broken his arm trying to smuggle himself into the UK. His story was repeated by many.
He said: "I try every night to get in a truck or hang on to the axle. Maybe 20 to 30 of us try each night. Some of my friends died.
"I don't want to stay in France. Afghanistan is worse than the camp but Britain is great. I get arrested all the time but I'll one day be successful. I'm prepared to die trying."
Migrants started gathering in huge numbers six months ago, turning a patch of grass close to the ferry terminal into a squalid camp.
If Khanabid is correct, an estimated 11,000 attempts have been made on Britain's border in the past year.
Calais immigration chief and deputy mayor Philippe Mignonet said the UK is seen as a "soft touch".
Tim Aker, head of policy at Ukip, said: "It is clear the Government's soft approach on border controls is driving many to risk their lives in an attempt to enter the country."
A Home Office spokesman said: "If they are seeking to evade immigration control, they are risking their lives and will get caught."
