Half a million people — a population the size of Manchester — will migrate to the UK from the rest of the European Union over the next five years, according to a report published today.
The numbers coming from the EU could overtake those from other parts of the world if Government policies continue to reduce immigration from outside Europe.
Britain’s economic recovery is expected to continue to fuel migration from southern European states hit hard by the eurozone crisis, according to the report by Migration Watch UK.
It estimates that net migration, the difference between those arriving and those leaving, from EU states will run at between 100,000 and 130,000 a year over the medium term, compared with an average 85,000 from 2004 to 2011.
The study comes after the overall net immigration figures showed a rise of 50,000 to 212,000 in the year to the end of September. The increase was fuelled by a surge in migration from the EU as migrants from Poland, Spain, Italy and France arrived seeking work.
Migration Watch UK warned that even when there was a return to economic growth in southern Mediterranean states, the incentive to migrate to the UK would remain strong.
