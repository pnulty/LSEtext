Ukip leader Nigel Farage arrived for his party's conference in Torquay in Devon and was presented with a piece of fruitcake.
Ukip organisers had set up a stall serving the tasty treats in response to David Cameron's comments about his party's members.
"They can abuse us as much as they want and the more they throw all these words at us, the more people vote for us," Mr Farage said, before declaring the fruitcake "delicious".
