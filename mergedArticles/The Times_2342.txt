David Cameron has spoken passionately about his desire for Scotland to remain in the UK, insisting that "we would be deeply diminished without Scotland". Now that sentiment is to take on a personal hue for the prime minister and his wife Samantha, who have hired a Scottish nanny to take care of their three children.
The helper has been hired to replace Gita Lima, the family's long-serving Nepalese nanny, who will shortly go on maternity leave.
The new nanny, whose name is not known, was shown the ropes yesterday by Ms Lima, joining her on the children's school run.
As well as strengthening the bond between London and Edinburgh, the appointment of a British nanny will also avoid awkward questions about the rights and wrongs of hiring foreign workers at a time when immigration is a central electoral issue.
Downing Street was forced to defend the couple's decision to hire Ms Lima this year after a home office minister criticised a "wealthy metropolitan elite" who used migrants to provide "cheap labour".
The couple have previously demonstrated an unusual taste in au pairs. When Ms Lima took a break in 2012 they hired a smoking, drinking Australian backpacker to fill in.
Sammi Strange, then 24, got the job after a series of interviews with the Camerons conducted over Skype. In an online survey on a social networking site, she admitted shoplifting, smoking and drinking, but denied taking drugs "in the past month".
