EXCLUSIVE . Migration stats set for release on polling day
BOMBSHELL new immigration figures come out the very morning Brits go to the Euro polls – leading Tory bosses to fear an even bigger ballot box meltdown.
In an extraordinary twist of luck, the Office of National Statistics will issue their next quarterly migration numbers on May 22.
That is polling day for both the European Parliament and council elections.
The figures will see the number of Romanian and Bulgarians who have come here since restrictions were lifted on January 1 unveiled for the first time.
Conservative ministers fear it will be grim news for them – confirming another huge number of arrivals from the poorer EU states.
Immigration is the No 1 ballot box issue for voters in next month's nationwide vote.
But as the statistics release date was set BEFORE polling day was confirmed, ministers are now powerless to change it.
One Tory minister told The Sun: "The timing could not possibly be worse for us.
"It's sheer bad luck, but there is nothing we can do but suck it up."
An ONS spokesman said: "The date of these Euro elections was moved at quite a late stage.
"Because the migration stats had already been scheduled by then it appears they should go ahead as planned."
