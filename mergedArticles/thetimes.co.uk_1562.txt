Two immigration officers who made no-win, no-fee compensation claims for thousands of pounds against the Home Office after a work car in which they were travelling had a “little bump” with a bollard, were said in the High Court to be liars as the case was dismissed.
Paula McIntyre had cried: “My neck, my neck, I can make a compensation claim,” after the incidentin Liverpool in 2008, but did not see a doctor for 18 days. Medical reports supporting her claim were identical to those of her colleague, Louise Hennessy, and recorded “severe and constant” physical symptoms.
They had been passengers in a Skoda driven by Denise Withey, whose photographs of the car showed no damage. Mr Justice Mostyn said yesterday that the pair’s evidence was “inaccurate, evasive, partial and advanced for an improper pecuniary motive”.
“This is yet a further example of the national phenomenon of false whiplash claims being made,” said the judge, who also queried the validity of the medical evidence.
