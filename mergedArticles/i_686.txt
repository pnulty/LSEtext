The BBC has been "broadly liberal", unbalanced on issues such as Europe and immigration, and "grotesquely over-managed", its own presenter John Humphrys has said.
With an internal report set to recommend that the BBC licence fee - frozen at £145.50 - be pegged to inflation from 2020, the Today programme co-host criticised the large "irresponsible" pay-offs to some former BBC staff and said that money had, under previous regimes, been "chucked around".
Humphrys admitted to Radio Times magazine: "The BBC has tended over the years to be broadly liberal as opposed to broadly conservative for all sorts of perfectly understandable reasons. The sort of people we've recruited - the best and the brightest - tended to come from universities and backgrounds where they're more likely to hold broadly liberal views."
He said the BBC had made mistakes in the way it covered Europe and immigration but that it was now more balanced.
