Osborne's own father-inlaw has branded the Government's policy on immigration NASTY.
Tory peer Lord Howell said it was clobbering trade and tourism.
Revealing a Lords Committee report into how Britain can up its image, he said immigration rules blocked skilled workers and talented students.
He blasted: "We're not getting it right." And he added that the policies were creating "a nasty Britain feeling".
A No 10 spokeswoman said the priority was to have a "controlled system that allows the best and brightest" immigrants to enter the UK.
