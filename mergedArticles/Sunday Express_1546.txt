AFTER years of struggling with the cryptic crossword, young Morse may have unravelled the deeper mystery of romance.
The new series of Endeavour, the prequel to the Morse stories set in the 1960s, sees the intellectual Oxford detective fall for Monica, a nurse who lives across the corridor from him. She is played by Shvorne Marks.
Writer Russell Lewis said: "We chose a second generation immigrant who captures the changing times of the 1960s.
"It was essential she worked in nursing to highlight the talented immigrants who have done so much for the country." Shaun Evans, who plays Endeavour Morse, said: "My character doesn't relate to people, to a woman and yet their relationship develops from her borrowing sixpence and begins to blossom but it is not going to work out.
"She is more keen than Morse but as the series develops we see him falling in love with her but his work is suffering and he has to choose: a happy relationship or do the job."
The new ITV series begins on Sunday, March 30.
