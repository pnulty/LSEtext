THE flood of Polish workers into Britain is finally over after 10 years, it was claimed last night.
Poland’s UK Ambassador Witold Sobkow said workers were now staying at home because there were “more opportunities”.
Their own booming economy is providing better jobs and wages.

Mr Sobkow said: “This huge wave of people who came to EU countries trying to get well-paid jobs is over.

“We have had huge economic success, wages are higher in Poland now and there are more jobs in many parts. We are getting out of the crisis and there are more and more opportunities in our country.”
Poland joined the European Union in 2004, triggering one of the biggest waves of immigration ever seen in Britain.
Mr Sobkow added: “Of course people would like to stay in Poland and not live abroad.
“They love the UK – but there is no place like home.”
