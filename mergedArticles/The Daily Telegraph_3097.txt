Germany's Eurosceptics will not work with Nigel Farage in the European Parliament because of the UK Independence Party's antiimmigration policies, one of the leaders of Alternative für Deutschland has said.
The party is expected to return at least six MEPs after Europe–wide elections next month. Hans–Olaf Henkel said: "We're not going to go with Ukip because they want to dissolve the EU, which is not our programme, and their immigration policy looks ridiculous."
