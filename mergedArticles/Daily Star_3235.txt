Says..
AT last a politician is talking some sense on immigration.
Iain Duncan Smith has vowed to ban immigrants from claiming benefits in Britain for a year.
At the moment, new arrivals can pocket taxpayers' cash within weeks of coming to our shores.
But finally Britain looks set to snub the barmy EU rules and end the farce.
About time too. Why should graspers who have put nothing into our welfare system cash in straight away? It's time the UK stood up to Europe and stood up for the British people.
We've had enough of being taken to the cleaners.
The Government must end the benefits free-for-all now.
It's time to stop the gravy train.
