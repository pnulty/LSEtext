UNDERESTIMATE Nancy Dell'Olio - currently said to be walking out with the Duchess of Cornwall's brother and therefore hovering on the perimeters of the Royal Family - at your peril. I've had many encounters with the femme fatale over the years and like many who came to scoff but stayed to admire, I've been forced to gawp in awe.
Nancy may not have managed to hang on to Sven. She may be billed as a lawyer but only practised briefly. She may mangle the English language so violently it's impossible even to have a stab at what she thinks she's attempting to say.
Her sartorial philosophy may be "more is more" - the most suitable outfit for every occasion involves a swathe of fur, killer stilettoes, tarantula false eyelashes and an entire bottle of musky perfume - but Nancy is irrepressible.
Encountering her on Channel 5's The Big Immigration Row, I was floored by her panache, self-deprecating sense of humour and irrepressible glamour. She's a phenomenon. She's never leaving and it's Italy's loss.
