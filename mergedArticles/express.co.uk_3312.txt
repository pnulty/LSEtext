THE NUMBER of workers from Eastern Europe has risen by 115,000 within the last year, according to official figures.
Employment is up new figures show[GETTY]
Ukip have claimed it is proof that Britain has “lost control of its borders” after it emerged there are now 802,000 people from the so-called A8 countries in jobs in the UK. 
The figure is an increase of more than 14 per cent since last year with one minister admitting the Government will struggle to reduce net migration to its stated target of below 100,000 before May 2015. 
New statistics also showed 140,000 Romanian and Bulgarians in work, although that figure has actually dropped since labour restrictions were relaxed at the start of the year. 
The data came in a raft of financial and employment figures released this morning by the Office of National Statistics and the Bank of England. 
As a whole, UK unemployment is now at a five-year-low while employment is at a 40 year high of more than 30 million.
The Bank of England also upgraded their growth forecasts, declaring that the economy is finally “heading back to normal” after years of crippling recession. 
The ONS figures revealed that out of 30.3 million workers in the UK, 4.5million were from overseas. They include 1.7 million from the 27 EU nations, 443,000 from India and 132,00 from Australia and New Zealand. 
In March 2013 the number of workers from the A8 nations stood at 687,000 – compared to 802,000 in March 2014. 
Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: "These numbers represent another huge increase in the number of foreign workers coming into Britain. Far from controlling immigration, this Government has shown it has absolutely no control over Britain's borders and no intention of putting the British people first.
"Having promised the British electorate that they would bring net immigration down to the tens of thousands, the Government has instead overseen another massive increase in those coming to Britain.
"Only Ukip will leave the EU and restore proper borders that mean we can have quality control and volume control when it comes to immigration, rather than the free-for-all that the coalition have overseen following Labour's immigration failure."
The Conservatives had pledged to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands by the election next year but today Defence minister Anna Soubry told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: "At the moment we don't seem to be on course."
The number of Romanians and Bulgarians coming to the UK since last year has increased by 25 per cent year on year and rose from 112,000 to 140,000 from 2013 to 2104.
However the expected increase since labour restrictions were relaxed has not happened with many saying that fears over an influx were premature. 
Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: "These figures are unsurprising. The Committee viewed for itself how the supposed flood of immigration from Romania and Bulgaria was little more than a trickle. It would appear now that many may have actually left the UK."
He added: "By not understanding the likely levels of immigration we risk increasing the poisonous rhetoric and prejudice which leads to the destruction of all rational debate.”
Today however MigrationWatch stood by their original assertion that 250,000 people could come from Romania and Bulgaria over the next five years. 
Chairman Sir Andrew Green said: "These quarterly statistics always fluctuate.
"The latest annual figures show an increase of 28,000, in a period when restrictions were in place for nine months.
"We believe they are consistent with our estimate of a 50,000 population increase from Romania and Bulgaria for each of the next five years."
Overall there are now 30.3 million people in work, which is the highest since records began in 1971, according to the ONS. 
Self-employment has also reached a record high of 4.5million. 
Unemployment has fallen to 6.8 per cent, or 2.2 million – down from 7.2 per cent three months ago. It is tipped to drop 5.9 per cent within two years. 
Bank of England governor Mark Carney said Gross Domestic Product was close to regaining its pre-financial crisis level and that 700,000 more people were in work than a year ago.
He said: "The UK economy continues to perform strongly. The economy has started to head back towards normal."
The Bank forecast GDP to grow by 3.4 per cent this year - unchanged from its previous prediction - but increased the target for next year from 2.7 per cent to 2.9 per cent.
However, the forecast for 2016 has fallen from 2.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent.
Mr Carney quelled fears that the lower unemployment figure would lead to a rise in interest rates soon, saying the real recovery had only just begun.
