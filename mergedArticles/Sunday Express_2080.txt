IMMIGRANTS need to learn to speak English and to "respect our way of life", new Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has said.
The son of Pakistaniborn parents and the first Asian Secretary of State, Mr Javid said people were entitled to expect immigrants to contribute to society.
"People want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right," he told a Sunday paper.
"People also say, when immigrants do come to Britain, they should come to work, and make a contribution and that they should respect our way of life, and I agree. It means things like trying to learn English," he said.
His comments come before Thursday's Euro elections when the Tories are under pressure from the UK Independence Party.
