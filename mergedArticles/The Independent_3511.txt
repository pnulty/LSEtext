A Jamaican woman who was refused a visa to come to Britain to donate a kidney to her seriously ill brother will now be allowed in after a change of heart by the Home Office.
In a case highlighted by The Independent, Keisha Rushton's brother Oliver Cameron suffered renal failure in 2012. Now James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, has overturned the initial refusal. Ms Rushton is expected to arrive within days.
