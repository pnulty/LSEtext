An asylum-seeker who fears that her two young daughters will become victims of female genital mutilation (FGM) if they return to Nigeria could be detained in Britain, with her children, after refusing to board a flight home yesterday.
Afusat Saliu, 31, a victim of FGM herself, was reportedly too worried about her daughters Bassy, three, and Rashidat, one, to voluntarily return to Nigeria yesterday. She now may be forcibly removed.
Last night, Ms Suliu's MP, George Mudie, was asking the Immigration minister's office to reconsider her case. More than 100,000 people have signed a petition calling on the Home Office to review her claim. "It's one thing ...
sending an adult back," Mr Mudie told i. "But these are two defenceless children."
Ms Saliu, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, said she fled Nigeria in 2011 after her stepmother wanted her eldest child to undergo FGM. She said she applied for asylum in 2012 but was refused.
The Home Office said: "We believe those who fail to establish a genuine fear of persecution should return home voluntarily. If they do not, we will enforce their removal."
