Backbencher Nigel Mills said official figures showing a near 40 per cent surge in net migration to 212,000 last year were a “disaster".
And he called for a fresh attempt to amend the Immigration Bill to introduce tighter restrictions on newcomers.
He told the Sun: “It’s entirely what we were fearing and proves that we need to put proper restrictions in place.
“It shows how out of control immigration is and how we are not going to get anywhere near the target."
The pledge to slash net migration was a key part of the Conservative party manifesto in 2010.
Home Secretary Theresa May told the Sun exclusively four years ago: “We’ll reduce immigration and you can judge us on it."
One Tory said the Coalition had to live up to its promises, or lose more votes to UKIP and Nigel Farage.
Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, yesterday said the Government’s boasts had been made to look “foolish".
She blasted: “These figures show the Government’s net migration target is in tatters, and their immigration policy is a mess."
And in yet another sign of the huge divide in the Coalition, Lib Dem Business secretary Vince Cable rubbished the idea of having a target at all.
He said: “Any target on migration is totally impractical, cannot be delivered and would do great damage to the economy."
