SNP leader Alex Salmond likes to remind people of his background as an economist. This is possibly because, given the unmitigated shambles that is his party's financial policy for an independent Scotland, no one would ever guess as much.
The latest to question his promises of wealth and security for all is pensions expert David Davison. He says that, in order to fund pensions for Scotland's ageing population, we would have to find room - and, presumably, gainful employment - for an extra million immigrants over the next 50 years.
Mr Davison is, by any definition, an expert on the subject and has based his calculations not on political allegiances, but on cold facts and statistics available to all. Put simply, the ratio of working Scots to retirees is not sufficient to guarantee that pension and welfare payments will match those in the rest of the UK - at least, not without spending cuts and tax rises.
This is not an anti-immigration issue, merely further proof that, without the security of liabilities spread across the larger, more robust British economy, the financial prospects for pensioners in a Scotland separate from the rest of the UK are, at best, uncertain. Anyone who chooses to accept Mr Salmond's airy assurances on the matter is taking a terrible, and unnecessary, risk.
