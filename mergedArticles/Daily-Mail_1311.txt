Looking back on my days as a Tory MP in the Commons is like reflecting on my childhood. All the days seemed to be sunny and the characters larger than life.
But I'm sure that they genuinely were always far more interesting than today's lot — many of whom are pretty vanilla.
People moan about the standard of behaviour in the chamber, but it's a teddy bears' picnic compared with the Eighties, when I started out as a Tory MP for Harlow in Essex — a constituency I represented until 1997.
Back then, there was plenty of aggressive, alpha-male stuff — much of it from those who had actually fought hand-to-hand in the war. Today's bunch weep to the Press if another Member so much as frowns at them. And the men are as bad as the women.
So, where are the big beasts now? On the Tory side, apart from David Cameron, George Osborne and Theresa May, the nearest contenders are Eric Pickles and Michael Gove.
Labour has more of a problem. Ed Miliband still hasn't quite found his voice, and Ed Balls is probably the one big beast they have left, though he's been wrong on just about everything.
But none compare to the characters I encountered during my time in the Commons, whose antics were often as outrageous as they were entertaining.
My dust-up with Tebbit
One of the golden rules in politics is that those who appear to be rather nice often aren't, and those who seem ferocious are rather engaging. Two names come to mind: Dennis Skinner and Norman Tebbit.
Labour MP Skinner is regarded by those who don't know him as a national treasure. In reality, he's a ghastly, bigoted, self-obsessed and probably the most unpopular man in the Commons.
But reading his press, you'd think he's an institution. And, in a bizarre unpleasant sort of way, I suppose he is. The sort of institution that requires its guests to wear jackets with buckles round the back.
What confirmed his copper-bottomed unpleasantness for me was an incident after the Brighton bombing in 1984.
John Wakeham, the Tory Chief Whip, had lost his wife and was horribly injured. Weeks later, the chamber was packed for a debate when the main doors suddenly swung open.
And there, standing on crutches, was a very frail John Wakeham.
Painfully, he hobbled to his place on the front bench. The debate came to a halt.
In one movement, the House rose in respectful silence for the courage of a man who'd suffered so much. Well, all of us stood save for Skinner, who sat scowling in his place. What a revolting little man.
On the other side of the coin is Norman Tebbit — another man who suffered terrible personal loss at the bombing.
He was a rottweiler in the chamber, and nicknamed the Chingford Skinhead by Labour leader Neil Kinnock.
But actually, he's a nice guy, with a twinkle in his eye and a great sense of humour. Although we did have a little falling-out.
Just after the 1987 election, I walked to the House on a beautiful day with a spring in my step. As I entered the Members' cloakroom, an enormous bulletproof limo glided to a halt outside.
A gothic gloom descended and Conservative Party chairman Norman Tebbit, with a smile like the brass plate on a coffin, marched in.
'Morning, Norman. Lovely day, mate,' I smiled.
'What's so lovely?' came the curt reply.
'What's the matter?' I asked
'You, you c***. I saw you on the News At Ten last night. Asking for more money for pensioners and the health service.'
'But I was only being reasonable.'
At that, Norman came up close and started prodding me in the chest, giving me the full hairdryer. 'It's not your job to be reasonable. Your job is to unquestioningly support your leader and your party, in that order.'
And, with a snarl, off he strode.
A few years later, I was making a film for Newsnight. John Major was Prime Minister and the Amish wing of the party was causing him grief over Europe.
At that point, Tebbit made a speech of such stunning disloyalty towards Major that it would have led to summary execution in Zimbabwe.
Afterwards, he was surrounded by the usual dandruff-flecked ghastlies, who were in a state of damp-gusseted ecstasy over his words. I sauntered up and said: 'Unquestioning loyalty to your leader, eh? Who's the c*** now?'
It didn't go down well.
Enoch's war on snoring
For a few months, I shared a desk in the Commons library with Enoch Powell — a tiny, trim little man, with a strong Black Country accent and piercing blue eyes.
When Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister, he'd refused to have Enoch sit opposite him in Cabinet as he said that 'he had the eyes of a fakir'.
To me, Enoch was always studiously polite. But he didn't like to be disturbed. He had his own way of dealing with snorers in the library: he'd creep up behind them and bang two large books together. It always worked.
He also used to get rather irritated by the Commons barber, who was almost as lethal with a cut-throat razor as Sweeney Todd (and made me look as if I'd been hurled though a car windscreen). This barber never stopped talking, which annoyed Enoch.
On one occasion, the barber asked him what sort of haircut he'd like. The grim reply was: 'A silent one.' Although sometimes a little quirky and remote, Enoch had a dry sense of humour. Once, when I was travelling by train to speak at an Oxford Union debate, he happened to be in the seat next to mine.
We had a delightful chat and as we were walking in the direction of the Union a chanting mob could be heard. Poor Enoch had to put up with a lot of abuse, even though it was more than 15 years since his controversial Rivers of Blood speech warning of the perils of immigration.
Once one occasion we appeared on Any Questions together —- protesters water-bombed us and the programme came off air for about ten minutes.
So I thought that a few words of encouragement were needed during our Oxford walk. 'I'm sorry you have to put up with so much abuse — it must be dreadful,' I ventured.
He smiled and simply said, in that lilting Black Country accent: 'If you listen carefully, you will hear that the abuse is aimed at you, not me. I'm off to dinner with some friends.'
And with that he raised his trademark homburg hat and disappeared into the night.
A punch from Prezza
I suspect John Prescott has a sensitive side; it's just that it is not apparent if you're a Tory, since he thinks we really are lower than vermin. It was probably being a steward on the cruise liners and having to serve Tory PM Anthony Eden and his ghastly braying entourage that gave Prescott his hatred not just of the policies but of the class.
But he did get his own back on a patronising Eden by 'accidentally' spilling scalding-hot soup on his crotch.
I often attempted to be jolly with Prescott but never succeeded in breaking through the barrier. Once, we both appeared (in different studios) on Radio 4's Today programme. I was being irritatingly jovial and gave Prezza a few playful metaphorical jabs on air.
I thought nothing of it until I bumped into him in the Members' lobby later.
With my legendary judgment and timing, I bounced up to him with a grin. 'Hi, John. That was a bit of fun this morning, wasn't it?'
All I can remember is a jab in the solar plexus and a low primal growl: 'You little Tory c***.'
And then Labour Chief Whip Derek Foster, grinning from ear to ear, and saying: 'Nice fellow, isn't he?'
Willie Whitelaw,
whisky fiend
At the start of the Aids campaign, I once found Willie Whitelaw, then Deputy Prime Minister to Margaret Thatcher, looking ashen-faced and forlorn, nursing a bucket of whisky in the Smoking Room. I asked him what the matter was.
His rheumy old oyster eyes looked up at me as he slowly shook his head as if ridding himself of a terrible memory. 'I've just spent an hour with Margaret,' he groaned.
'Well,' I said cheerily, 'grim, but not the end of the world.'
'Really? Not the end of the world? I was explaining to her what a*** sex was.'
I thought it best to leave him to his whisky. And, God, could that man drink. In the days when he was Ted Heath's Chief Whip, it was his occasional duty to rise and move: 'That this House do now adjourn.'
One evening, after a very good dinner, he misread the time and almost missed his cue. So he staggered to the Bar of the House, slurred the magic words and then collapsed in a heap.
Willie's idea of a light lunch was a bottle of champagne, a bottle of white, a bottle of red and a couple of large brandies.
When he had his first heart attack his doctor advised that he confined himself to one champagne before lunch. So he did. Just one bottle.
Willie also had a reputation for discretion. Very often in the Smoking Room, you could hear him booming to a minister: 'I want to tell you something in absolute confidence.'
To this day, I'm not quite sure whether this was a ruse to plant misinformation — or just that he had a very loud voice.
Denis really was a menace
Denzil Davies, the Shadow Defence Secretary under Neil Kinnock, had once been a Treasury Minister.
But sadly, his boss Denis Healey — then Chancellor — was a bit of an old bruiser and didn't like Denzil's rather mild Welsh manner. As for Denzil, he couldn't bear constantly being told by Healey that he was a t*** or a w***** or plain 'bastard'.
So, in the end, he got Healey to agree that they'd communicate via written memos rather than face-to-face.
It made no difference. As Denzil told me, Healey just used to scrawl t***, w***** or bastard in the margins of all the memos.
Healey could also be one hell of a bully in the chamber — particularly when he locked horns with Michael Heseltine. This would happen late at night, when everyone had been drinking.
Sometimes, it almost got physical, with Healey — an enormous presence and a former beach master at the D-Day landings — aggressively shouting at Hezza to sit down, adding 'you bastard' more sotto voce.
A Major peas protest
When he first became Prime Minister, John Major was a little star-struck. 'Well, now you're Prime Minister, you can have dinner with whomever you want,' he was told.
'Really? Even Joanna Lumley?' he asked. His wish was her command. Bless her, she came.
I once had lunch with him when Spitting Image was endlessly repeating a sketch of him eating peas off the end of a knife.
When he arrived, there on the table was an enormous tureen of peas.
'Oh God, not peas again,' he moaned. 'Don't they realise it's a joke? I can't stand the bloody things.'
Slipping Paisley a snifter
In his drinking days, the Press Association journalist Chris Moncrieff went to interview Ian Paisley. Clearly, Moncrieff must have smelt like a Guinness brewery, because the big man exploded.
And he point-blank refused to be interviewed by a man who had 'the devil's buttermilk on his breath'.
A few years later, an Ulster Unionist MP and I decided to set the big man up.
Over lunch, we told Paisley that we'd buy him the most expensive pudding on the Commons menu if we failed to make him laugh.
Well, he couldn't lose. So the prize pudding duly arrived and he got stuck in.
About five minutes into his pud, my chum, in fits of giggles, sniffed the air. 'Ian, I can smell the devil's buttermilk on your breath,' he said
Then I got a fit of the giggles — and we had to explain that the pudding he'd won was actually laced with about three liqueurs.
We looked apprehensively at the big man, but the expected explosion never came. Just a chuckle and then a booming laugh. But he never finished his pudding.
And despite the fact that I often had enough devil's buttermilk in me to make a rather large Satanic cheese, Paisley used to smile politely every time we met.
His abstinence was in sharp contrast to fellow Northern Ireland MP Gerry Fitt — a tremendous character, and also enormously brave.
He'd been bombed out of his Belfast home a few times and always returned. The final straw was when he fought off gunmen on the stairs.
Mrs Thatcher, to her credit,made him a life peer and he came to London. At Westminster, Gerry was a prodigious drinker, rarely seen without an industrial-sized gin and tonic in his hand.
When he sat on the Commons terrace, he'd wave to passing Thames pleasure boats, raising his glass with the salute: 'It's all free!' (Sadly, it wasn't.)
If he wasn't on the terrace, he could be seen with his long-suffering armed detective, chugging along the river in his own little boat, gin and tonic in hand, entreating us to join him.
Gerry insisted his detective match him, drink for drink. As the man was packing a weapon, he politely declined but agreed to join him drink for drink with tonic water.
A few weeks later, the detective was rushed to hospital. It took a while for the consultants to work out what was wrong.
It was an unusual condition: quinine poisoning as a result of an overdose of tonic water.
A good year for mistresses
Sir George Gardiner, a cadaverous old Right-winger, was one of Mrs Thatcher's earliest supporters and guardian of the True Flame of the Blessed Blue Shrine — otherwise known as the 1922 Committee, a group of Right-wing Tories. Actually, although we lived on different political planets, I rather liked old George.
We were having dinner one evening when I let it slip that it was my fortieth birthday. Suddenly, he became wistful.
'Ah, 40. That was when I had one of my finest mistresses,' he saidwith a sigh.
The day Fatty put his foot in it
I'm not sure how much he weighs, but were he the Aga Khan, who balances himself against a ray of gold and diamonds every year (God knows why), Nicholas 'Fatty' Soames would be a very wealthy man.
Being the grandson of Winston Churchill mercifully hasn't given him airs and graces. He sees the world and its problems pragmatically — but he does have his delightful moments of innocence.
In Eighties BBC recording studios, the sound man always needed to test the 'level', so he'd ask guests what they'd had for breakfast, and adjust the sound accordingly.
One of Nick's earliest broadcasts went like this. 'For the level, Mr Soames, what did you have for breakfast, sir?'
'Oh, some cold grouse and half a bottle of breakfast claret. What about you, old boy?'
Once, Soames came into the Commons Smoking Room, rather ashen-faced, and sank a large gin and tonic.
'I'm afraid I've done something quite unforgivable,' he wailed.
He'd just received a delegation of single mothers and had been rather sniffy about feckless women.
'Feckless, Mr Soames?' said one. 'We are all Falklands widows.'
The poor fellow was utterly mortified.
Downsizing the Heseltine way
After his resignation over the Westland helicopters affair in 1986, I bumped into Michael Heseltine at a party conference, and he offered to give me a lift back to my hotel.
As we were walking towards the exit, he was accosted by a pack of journos.
'What's it like not being in the Cabinet, Mr Heseltine?' was the deeply insightful question.
'Well, I do miss my ministerial car,' he said sadly.
Then he led me off to a magnificent limo, bristling like a porcupine with aerials —- and far, far grander than anything the government could provide. And he still had the same driver.
Not such a virgin train for Gordon
Once, the Labour leader John Smith was on a train up to Glasgow and found himself sitting next to Gordon Brown and a very rough-and-ready Glaswegian MP called Tommy Graham.
Tommy was a nice bloke but perhaps not a candidate for Brain of Britain. Put it this way: you weren't likely to drown in his gene pool.
The journey was coming to an end and, as Tommy hadn't been involved in the high-octane conversation between Brown and Smith, he felt he needed to make an impression.
As the train was pulling into Glasgow, he made an announcement. 'See tha fence over theeer?' he said in his impenetrable Glaswegian accent. 'Thass weer I shagged the missus for the feer taame.' And who said that the age of romance is dead?
Carry on in the cubicle
Dear old Ron Brown, a Scottish Labour MP, was affable but quite bonkers. His face was horribly scarred from receiving 5,000 volts in an industrial accident.
The word was that this had scrambled his brain. I remember coming back from a run and having a shower in the Members' changing room, then a rather Victorian affair with a tanning lamp that was built in the Twenties and looked as if it was on loan from Dr Frankenstein's laboratory.
Anyhow, as I was sluicing myself down, I heard gruntings and groans and then squeals of ecstasy. I looked in the end cubicle, and there was Ron indulging in what Private Eye used to call Ugandan discussions.
How Heath left Maggie seething
Ted Heath threw a party at the Savoy hotel to celebrate his 40th year in the House. The guests were glittering, the food and wine magnificent and an orchestra played discreetly in the background.
The only person not enjoying herself was Mrs Thatcher, who ousted Heath as Tory leader. Later, I pointed out to Ted that she seemed to be having rather an uncomfortable lunch as she was stuck between two people she loathed: Sonny Ramphal, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, and Bob Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Ted's smile grew to a grin, his grin to a belly laugh and then those famous shoulders started to gyrate. 'That was rather the point,' he chortled.
Ruskies who came to the rescue
Following the 1983 election, Mrs Thatcher made Peter Walker — that consummate political operator — her Energy Secretary. He was the first Cabinet minister to invite backbenchers to lunch in his office. I mean a proper lunch, with decent booze, laid on by private caterers at his department.
Pretty young girls who'd been to finishing school served us, and Peter paid for everything out of his own pocket. Politically, this was a very clever move, as he was able to keep backbenchers up to speed with the miners' strike in private.
One day, he was a little late and insisted that he caught us up on the booze front. After a few drinks, he let slip that MI5 had just told him they'd intercepted a container-load of cash from the Russians to support the miners' strike.
Peter said he'd insisted that the container should be allowed to get to Arthur Scargill's people. This rather confused us. Why, we asked.
'Oh, we did a deal with the Russians. They send money in fraternal solidarity to the NUM — and sell us cheap Russian coal so we can break the strike.'
And I thought I was pretty cynical.
