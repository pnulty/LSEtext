A PRIVATELY-RUN immigration removal centre for women failed to properly investigate allegations of sexual assault against a female resident by one of its members of staff, it has been claimed.
An investigation was carried out at Serco-operated Yarl's Wood, in Bedfordshire, after the claims relating to a 29-year-old woman from Pakistan came to light.
Serco's director at Yarl's Wood, Norman Abusin, said: "Sexual contact between residents and staff is always completely unacceptable."
