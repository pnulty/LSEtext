THIS paper's debate on immigration tonight at the Guildhall could not be more timely. The increase in net migration numbers last week to 212,000 — more than double the Government's 2015 target — has led to an unlikely alliance of the Business Secretary, Vince Cable, writing opposite, and Right-wing former Tory minister Liam Fox in calling for the target to be scrapped. Mr Cable warns that the target is a nonsense; Mr Fox wants it to be replaced by a policy of reducing low-skilled immigration.
Plainly all serious participants in this debate want to ensure that the UK remains open to people with skills who contribute to the economy. How to attract them, while safeguarding the interests of people living here, is a question on which there can be a legitimate diversity of views. Tonight they will all get aired.
