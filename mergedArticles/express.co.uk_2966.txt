BRITAIN'S immigration crisis continues to deepen as a direct result of EU membership.
It is now being predicted that official figures to be released at the end of the month will show that immigration from EU member states has outstripped arrivals from the rest of the world combined.
It is not difficult to understand why that is.
EU citizens can move to this country whenever they like with no restrictions.
Thanks to the strictures imposed by Brussels our politicians are powerless to stem this flow.
Immigrants coming from outside the EU remain subject to British border controls meaning we can in theory ensure that only migrants who will contribute positively to society can enter and that migration remains at a reasonable level. Indeed migration from outside the EU is dropping.
Being able to impose the same restrictions on EU migrants as we do on migrants from the rest of the world would give the Government a fighting chance of bringing immigrant numbers under control.
While we remain a member of the EU David Cameron’s pledge of reducing net migration to the “tens of thousands” will never be achieved.

Russia’s hand on gas tap
The latest dispute between Russia and Ukraine is due to the fact that the Russian state gas supplier is owed around í2billion by Ukraine.
Now the Russians have said that from now on they want to be paid up front before supplying any gas.
Russia’s ability to turn off the tap at will threatens not just Ukraine but the UK as well.
Britain’s failure to embrace fracking is looking increasingly foolish.
Extracting the shale gas hidden under our feet would provide cheap and plentiful energy.
It is the environmental lobby that is holding back progress on this vital technology.
The folly of covering our countryside in wind farms and solar panels has left us with an island full of useless eyesores that cannot possibly fulfil our demands for energy.
It is an uncomfortable truth for the Western politicians trying to stand up to Putin that we need Russia’s gas.
The threat of soaring fuel bills is a painful reminder of that.

Heat’s on for Cameron
Diners in a Bristol branch of the restaurant chain Nando’s will have almost choked on their chips when they were joined by none other than David Cameron.
Tories will be hoping that he can stand the heat of the upcoming general election battle as well as he withstood the heat of the chain’s signature spicy peri-peri chicken.
