Our traditions are threatened THE Prime Minister, David Cameron, has been reported as saying that ours is a Christian country.
The fact that he is simply stating the blindingly obvious has not stopped a bunch of bien pensants from the left-wing metropolitan elite from claiming, in a letter to a newspaper, that he is fomenting divisions in this country.
Are those same people, I wonder, writing letters to newspapers complaining about extremist Islamists attempting to take over schools in Birmingham by fair means or foul.
If that is not fomenting division I don't know what is.
It seems to me that the centuries' old traditions which have held this country together, and which, whether atheists like Eddie Sanders and me like it or not, includes Christianity, are increasingly under threat, whereas alien cultures, most particularly Islam, which have been allowed to enter this country during the last 60 years, are being allowed to get away with saying and doing more or less anything that they fancy, because, to oppose what they are saying or doing will have the anti-racist industry up in arms.
I can say with absolute honesty that I am no racist, but the more that I see what is happening to my country, the more I become convinced that Enoch Powell was right to question the wisdom of allowing more or less uncontrolled immigration to take place.
