WHEN the entire population of Romania failed to enter Britain on January 1 many were scornful of those who had warned that a massive influx was inevitable. The impoverished state joined the EU in 2007 but their nationals' rights to work across Europe were restricted until the start of this year.
But since then the number of Romanians seeking employment in this country has doubled. There have been an estimated 42,562 applications for British jobs through just one Romanian recruitment website.
While unemployment is falling under this Government there are still 2.4 million people in Britain who do not have a job and youth unemployment is a huge problem. That is not to mention the destructive effects of wage depression caused by the arrival of foreign workers willing to undercut British workers.
It is difficult to understand how anybody can believe that the intense competition for jobs from so many new immigrants will help. As this newspaper has long stressed the enforced opening of our borders has been disastrous for our economy and culture.
We need to wrest back control and end the scandal of unfettered immigration.
