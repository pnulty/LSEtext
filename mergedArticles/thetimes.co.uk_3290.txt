Over half all homes in the UK will be rented by 2032 as families continue to be squeezed out of the property market, research says today.
The study shows that since 2007 the private rented sector has grown from 14 per cent to 18 per cent of households while the proportion of homeowners has dropped from 68 per cent to 64 per cent reflecting high prices and short supply. On present trends private renting will become the norm for most people within two decades, it suggests.
A separate analysis for The Times shows that rents have shot up by over 30 per cent in areas such as Oxford, Kettering and Aberdeen and nearly 20 per cent in many London boroughs in the last three years.
Although those renting in central London still pay the most - £3,894 a month in Kensington - rents in Oxford have jumped 34 per cent from £1,196 to £1,601 since 2011 as housing shortages start pinching outside the capital.
However in large parts of the north rents have dropped by up to 9 per cent and figures later this week are expected to show that, while hotspots remain, rents have slowed across the country and in some regions fallen in the last 12 months.
The first study by the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association shows that by 2032, 49 per cent will own their own homes, 35 per cent will rent privately and 16 per cent will be in the social rent sector.
“If current trends continue without a major policy or economic shift to address the shortage of new homes, the majority of UK households will be renting in the private and social sectors by 2032 for the first time since the early 1970s,” said Peter Williams, IMLA executive director.
The demand for private renting was largely due to the fall in social housing, unaffordable house prices and the new tighter mortgage regulations, more students and immigrants, later marriage and rising separation rates.
However the report also points out that a high proportion of new private rented property has been acquired by cash buyers and commercial investors. Only 420,000 of the extra 1.3 million properties in the private rented sector between 2007 and 2012 were financed by buy-to-let loans.
The separate analysis by Rightmove/Savills gives a stark picture of how fast rents have risen in the country over the last three years. The data which compares the first quarter of 2011 with the first quarter of 2014 shows that rents have risen by 21 per cent in East Cambridgeshire, 20 per cent in Hertsmere and 17 per cent in South Bucks. However many northern areas have seen a drop to match local incomes. In Doncaster, Blackburn and Middlesborough rents have dropped by 4 per cent, while in East Lothian they have dropped by 9 per cent.
“There is a limit to what renters can afford to pay out of their disposable incomes,” said Milles Shipside, Rightmove director. “With average wage growth being outstripped by retail price inflation there appears to be a ceiling in some regions on tenants’ ability to pay.”
A survey from Countrywide, the estate agents suggests that the cost of renting relative to buying is at its cheapest since 2006, due to the rise in house prices. Rises in the average monthly rents of 3.7 per cent year on year have been overshadowed by a 5.6 per cent increase in house prices. It is now cheaper to rent than to buy in 30 out of 33 London boroughs and several areas in the southeast.
