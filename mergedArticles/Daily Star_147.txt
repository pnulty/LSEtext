THEY are two of the most controversial topics affecting Britain at the moment.
So no doubt new documentary Gypsies On Benefits And Proud will cause a storm.
Many of us are living in a country where we struggle to make ends meet.
Despite working hard every day, it's tough to pay the rent and bills, raise our children and feed our families.
So when we hear about people who have come from abroad and are given a house the moment they get here it's bound to grate.
Then when these same people choose to live on the welfare state rather than work it hurts a bit more.
No doubt these rotten eggs are damaging the reputation of all foreign workers.
There are plenty of examples of immigrants who embrace the British way of life and make a valuable contribution.
But it's important to highlight the injustice of those who contribute nothing and live a life on the take.
