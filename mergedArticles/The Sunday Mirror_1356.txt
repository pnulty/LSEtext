PRINCE Harry's favourite restaurant has been raided by immigration officers who arrested a kitchen hand on suspicion of being in the country illegally.
The upmarket La Brasserie in West London was packed with diners when UK Border Agency staff swooped.
An unidentified Moroccan man was led away in handcuffs. He is now in custody. The restaurant has been served with a "notice of potential liability" and could be fined up to Â£10,000.
Harry, 29, has regularly been spotted at the French diner, which is close to Kensington Palace where brother William and sister-in-law Kate live.
He had a meal there just days after returning from the royal family's Christmas gathering at Sandringham.
A source said of the immigration raid: "Diners were having a very civilised lunch when three officers, wearing tunics marked 'Immigration' on the back, stormed into the restaurant with handcuffs hanging off their belts.
"It was amazing, right in the middle of the restaurant at the busiest time of the week."
A Home Office spokesman said: "Businesses that follow the rules have nothing to fear, but those who either deliberately employ people with no right to work or fail to carry out the legally required checks on their staff should expect to face heavy financial penalties."
Yesterday the duty manager at La Brasserie said he could not comment on last month's incident.
