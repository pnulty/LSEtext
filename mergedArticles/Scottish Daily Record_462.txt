A CROSS-PARTY group of MPs have called for an urgent review of the immigration rules they say are tearing hundreds of British families apart.
Their two-year inquiry looked at the new requirement for British nationals or permanent residents to earn at least £18,600 a year if they are seeking to sponsor a non-EEA partner to come to the UK.
The rule has meant thousands of British citizens, including people with full-time jobs, have been unable to bring a non-European husband, wife or partner to live with them in Britain.
Over 280 submissions were received by the APPG on Migration inquiry committee, including more than 175 submissions from families who had been affected by the rules.
The committee's report includes examples of elderly couples who are denied the chance to retire together in Britain because their earnings fall short of the £18,600 threshold.
At the other end of the scale, an Australian who works as a £250,000-ayear chief financial officer in Dubai and has a £3.5million property in Britain cannot live with his British wife and children in the UK because she is not employed and his overseas earnings do not count.
The MPs' report states the income threshold has also led to many young children being separated from one of their parents, including one baby who was still breastfeeding when his mother was denied entry to Britain.
Lib Dem former children's minister Sarah Teather, a member of the inquiry committee, said the Government were far from meeting their pledge to support family life. She said: "Whatever the objective of the policy, children shouldn't suffer as a result."
