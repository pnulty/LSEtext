Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg gives an interview to the Financial Times to say the UK should welcome immigrants. He’s been on the pro-immigration beat for a while, and The Londoner recalls an outing he made to Congress in 2010 to argue a similar case for the US.
Alongside Bloomberg on this trip to Capitol Hill was his ideological ally Murdoch, Australian-born and now a US citizen, and a staunch advocate for immigration. So why not give an interview to Murdoch’s title The Times here, rather than the rival FT? Did he not wish to compromise its editorial independence?
