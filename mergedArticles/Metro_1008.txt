CULTURE secretary Sajid Javid has said immigrants need to learn to speak English and to 'respect our way of life'. Mr Javid, the son of Pakistanis, said it was 'perfectly reasonable' to expect that those settling here make a contribution to society. 'People want Britain to have more control over its borders and I think they are right,' he added. Mr Javid also criticised those who had failed to assimilate into British society, despite living in the country for many years.
