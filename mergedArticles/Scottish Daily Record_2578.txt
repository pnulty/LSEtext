THE Scottish Tory leader yesterday claimed a majority of Scots hold Conservative values.
Ruth Davidson said: "On the referendum, we are fighting to keep our kingdom united and are backed by the majority of this country.
"On welfare, we say work should always pay and that's what Scotland thinks too.
"On the economy, we're cutting the deficit and controlling spending, because it is immoral to shackle our children with our debts. The country's onside.
"On immigration, we want the numbers down, so does Scotland."
Davidson also praised "everyday grafters" in her party conference speech in Edinburgh.
She said: "Our future prosperity will come from an economy built on a strong and growing working class.
"And when I say a strong working class, I mean anyone who gets up, goes to a job and earns a wage to support themselves and their families."
Davidson also said the Scottish Tories wanted to hire an extra 1000 nurses and midwives by scrapping universally free prescriptions.
