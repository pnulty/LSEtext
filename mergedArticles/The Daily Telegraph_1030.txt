DAVID CAMERON has apparently cooled on his party's pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands by next May's general election.
The Prime Minister was repeatedly asked in a television interview whether he was sticking to his commitment to cut the number of people coming to the UK to fewer than 100,000.
But five times he declined specifically to say that he wanted to achieve this by 2015, instead insisting that the Conservatives were "working towards" the target.
Interviewed on Sky News's Murnaghan programme, Mr Cameron said: "We are working towards it, we are doing everything we can to deliver on it and we should continue to do that."
Asked again whether the figure was still a target for the general election, Mr Cameron said: "I want to see net migration down to the tens of thousands, not only because it is right for the British economy, because we should be training our own people for these jobs.
"But also, if you look back to the 1980s, when net migration was in the tens of thousands, we were an open economy then.
"But do you know what, immigration wasn't a big political issue because it was properly under control and that's what I want to achieve again."
Net migration – the number coming to Britain for at least a year, minus the numbers leaving – rose by 58,000 to 212,000 in the year to September 2013.
The pledge to cut net migration to fewer than 100,000 was made in the Conservative manifesto in May 2010.
However, the Liberal Democrats resisted including the specific target in the Coalition agreement, which set out what ministers would do.
The Prime Minister's comments represent an apparent shift from his position last week, when Mr Cameron told MPs that the May 2015 target was "perfectly feasible".
He continued: "We have brought net migration into the UK down by a fifth under this government – not as much as I would like."
Mr Cameron said that Britain had taken in people from the stricken eurozone.
Speaking a day later, Anna Soubry, a defence minister, admitted that the target looked likely to be missed.
Miss Soubry said: "At the moment, we don't seem to be on course."
