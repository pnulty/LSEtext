Party's lone MEP set to lose his seat
THE Liberal Democrats are bracing themselves for a pasting at the ballot box as voters go to the polls for the European elections.
The party's only Scottish MEP, George Lyon, is expected to lose his Brussels seat.
Scotland's six European seats are made up of two SNP MEPs, two Labour, one Tory and Mr Lyon.
Support for the Lib Dems is at an all-time low, but the Conservatives are also on course for their worst Euro election in Scotland, with the party currently polling at just 13%.
John Curtice, professor at politics at Strathclyde University, said: "Labour's support is estimated to be 26% to 27%. The party's representation would remain at two seats.
"The Conservatives are running at 13%, the party's worst ever in a Euro election in Scotland, although it would keep its one seat.
Support "The Lib Dems seem unlikely to enjoy even that consolation. Their support is estimated at 6% to 7%."
The SNP and Ukip are fighting it out for the Lib Dem seat.
Ukip candidate David Coburn said: "The SNP is just interested in the referendum and does not care if it means fewer jobs and businesses moving south."
The rising support of Nigel Farage's party has provoked First Minister Alex Salmond to appeal to voters to back his candidate.
He said: "It is a contest between the new Scotland of hope and ambition ... and the appalling politics of intolerance being peddled by Nigel Farage's Ukip."
A poll published yesterday by Dundee University's Five Million Questions project revealed that 70% of Scots back Ukip's stance on curbing immigration, slashing overseas aid and cracking down on benefits.
