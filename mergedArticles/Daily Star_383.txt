DAILY STAR Says..
HEALTH charities have warned that the NHS is so overstretched it will collapse within two years.
They say financial meltdown is "inevitable" unless a mountain of cash is pumped in.
It's an absolute disgrace. But it's no surprise the wheels have fallen off.
The NHS is hailed as Britain's proudest achievement.
But years of under-funding and neglect has left it in ruins.
Soaring demand, shortage of doctors and rampant immigration has pushed services to breaking point.
The blame lies fairly and squarely with a succession of governments.
The warning signs have been staring them in the face but they've failed to act.
Now it's time ministers came up with a rescue plan.
They need to pump emergency funds into the NHS and hire more staff before its too late.
It must be saved.
