News | NEWS IN BRIEF IMMIGRATION
Serious exploitation of migrant labour in a bid to undercut wages would be made a criminal offence under a Labour government, the shadow Home Secretary will say.
In a speech outlining Labour's approach to immigration, Yvette Cooper will set out plans to consult on revising the existing criminal offence of forced labour so more exploiters of migrants are prosecuted.
Ms Cooper will attack the Government for having a "worst of all worlds" approach to immigration, in which illegal immigration is getting worse while businesses are unable to access the skills they need.
She will say: "We do not want to live in a society dependent on the exploitation of cheap migrant labour - it increases low-skilled immigration, increases unfairness and resentment."
