THERE may well be a reshuffle as soon as David Cameron seeks to create a team that is not entirely public school. And one who may be rising within it is Priti Patel. I went over to speak two elections ago when she was competing for her Essex constituency, a firstâ€“timer, and liked what I saw. The child of Ugandan Asian immigrants she went to a comprehensive, was very bright and pretty (no pun) with it. More to the point she can pull votes and DC is going to need that as an orchid needs water. Because of her ethnicity, background and personality she could go down a storm in any of the 80 marginals that are going to control the next election.
