John Vine, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, raises concerns over how Border Force officials carry out secret luggage searches
Border guards have carried out unauthorised covert searches of passenger’s suitcases, a watchdog has revealed.
John Vine, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, said there was a lack of oversight of baggage searches at some airports.
Officials questioned by Mr Vine even admitted they were happy to rifle through travellers’ medical records and legal documents without the owner’s knowledge.
Mr Vine said the use of baggage searches without the traveller’s permission - which must be approved by a senior manager - could be “intrusive” but were necessary to protect Britain’s border.
He said the Border Force had generally used the covert searches “necessarily and proportionately”, finding prohibited or restricted goods in about one third of searches.
But he added: “Luton airport had been operating these baggage examinations without any authorisation procedures or assurance from managers.”
Staff at Edinburgh airport said they were “content to examienmaterial they considered to be ‘confidential’ during a baggage examination” including “personal medical records and legally privileged correspondence”.
Mr Vine said it was a “cause for concern” that there was no guidance on how staff should treat searches where confidential material was discovered.
He made four recommendations for improvement, including that guidance should be updated.
