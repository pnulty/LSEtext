UKIP'S troubled election campaign has taken another turn for the worse - after a by-election candidate allegedly lashed out at a one-armed protester.
Roger Helmer, 70, allegedly started a fight with David Challoner when he questioned him about his expenses.
However, Ukip said its candidate for Newark, who once likened homosexuality to mental illness, was provoked by the district councillor who lost his limb in an industrial accident.
'A rentamob turned up led by a councillor chanting "Roger down", a Ukip spokesman said.
'He tried to take the megaphone and was pulled away. He wasn't arrested and he's not heard from the police.' The latest scandal in Retford, Nottinghamshire, came a day after Nigel Farage's deputy told protesters to 'f*** off' during a leafleting drive.
Janice Atkinson, who is also Ukip's press adviser, is accused of insulting a rival about her weight, then 'flipping the bird' at her.
Maria Pizzey, who was allegedly targeted by the party official, said: 'This is the most aggressive individual I have had the misfortune to come across.' Meanwhile, leading Labour figures have said Mr Farage is racist. Tottenham MP David Lammy accused Mr Farage of being 'deeply nasty'.
But yesterday, Mr Farage replied: 'Our immigration policy, far from being racist, aims to end discrimination against non-Europeans.'
