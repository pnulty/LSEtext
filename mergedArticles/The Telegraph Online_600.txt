"I view it as a sort of miracle," said Sir Peter Michael on the phone, when I asked him about the landscape surrounding his winery in Knights Valley, northern California. “You sit with a glass of wine in hand, looking at the sunset. It is absolutely stunning territory."
Days later, as my claret Nissan Altima hybrid – a fashionable choice, as I was soon to learn – came gliding to a halt in the parking area, I could see what he meant. His main office is a white shingle-and-timber building with a charming little bell tower poking up into a brilliant blue sky. Mount St Helena soars above deep-green foothills ribbed with vines and, on hot days, eagles can be seen turning tight circles in the thermal currents.
I’d imagined this area of Sonoma County, an hour’s drive north-east of San Francisco, to be familiar and somewhat tame, a subtler twin to Napa County, with its faux chateaux and coachloads of wine tourists. But there is nothing tame about Sonoma. Wild and beautiful, it recalls the paintings of Gregory Kondos, with their sun-browned valleys, curvaceous hills and expanses of water in exuberant Mediterranean blues. Deer congregate near the huge solar panels that provide the estate’s energy. And, where deer hang out, fearsome mountain lions hunt. Brown bears are also known to frequent these hills, as do skunks, possums and coyotes – a who’s who of the wildlife headliners of the great American West.
Sir Peter Michael is something of a headliner himself and, like California’s natural wonders, is larger than life. A British technology venture capitalist, he discovered the beauty of Sonoma-Napa in 1972 on weekend trips north from the California headquarters of his Quantel high-tech company. In the early 1980s, he bought hundreds of acres and planted vines on what was originally cattle-ranching land on the Sonoma side of the mountains. His aim was to create a world-class winery and a family retreat for generations of Michaels to come. In both, he succeeded.
Back in England, his legacy is The Vineyard, a five-star hotel with an exceptional collection of Californian wines. They come not only from the Peter Michael Winery but also from a select group of suppliers including Schramsberg, world-famous for its sparkling wines, Charles Heintz, Honig and Rudd. Most of these estates are open for tastings, though often by appointment only. Together, the wines in Sir Peter’s cellars represent the cutting edge of Californian winemaking.
With The Vineyard as my unofficial wine concierge, I set off on a three-day trip with a friend to experience the very best of the region’s wine, food and lodgings. Starting from Sacramento, where I have lived for the past decade, we headed south-west through Davis, Dixon and Vacaville to Fairfield. The colours became more extreme as we left the I-80, one of America’s great cross-country roads, and drove west to the town of Napa itself. In late spring, the burned grass of the hillsides was as golden-brown as a Van Gogh haystack, while the green trees and vines took on ever-deeper hues.
The noises of urban life began to dissipate. It was an absence of sound that first struck me when we stopped for a capuccino at the Small World Cafe in Napa. In the window were dozens of model vintage cars, of the throaty sports and supercar variety. By contrast, many of the vehicles on the streets were muted. The Prius hybrid is the best-selling car in California these days – and the higher an area’s income, the more eco-friendly the traffic. In Napa, the Tesla electric car is more of a status symbol than a Rolls-Royce, cruising silently past the salons and upscale clothing stores, the Quent Condair Fine Art gallery and Joey’s Bakery, with its delightful cakes.
Half an hour after finishing our coffees, we were deep in wine country. Napa County has just four per cent of California’s wine-producing acreage, but it accounts for a third of the dollars generated by wine sales. Sonoma County is larger and its vineyards grow a wider variety of grapes. The scenery is more dramatic, the hills higher. There is a sense of menace, almost, to some of its densely wooded slopes. Where Napa’s broad valleys are sun-drenched, Sonoma’s are hemmed in by high hills. It is a mountain-biker’s paradise.
Most visitors come to Sonoma-Napa not for the adventure sports but to eat in some of America’s finest restaurants, including The French Laundry in Yountville, where reservations have to be made months in advance. More accessible are the Michelin-starred restaurant at the Auberge du Soleil resort, and Morimoto Napa, in the town of Napa itself, serving the delicate sushi creations of the chef and television star Masaharu Morimoto.
Fine restaurants require fine wines, which the Peter Michael Winery has been happy to supply. Virtually every Michelin-starred restaurant in America stocks the vineyard’s cabernets, says sales manager Peter Kay, including the signature Les Pavots, and several stock its pinot noirs and chardonnays, too.
That success is due to an extraordinary attention to terroir. Sir Peter’s team measures variations in the mineral content of the volcanic soil, and the moisture, sunlight and wind to which different parts of his land are exposed, then plants the grapes accordingly. In Sonoma County, famous for its micro-climates, planting a couple of thousand feet apart can result in very different conditions.
The result is a set of superior wines, with delicate variations in texture and huge aromatic shifts from label to label. One can practically smell, touch and taste the earth’s varying qualities in each glass. Over lunch at the winery, Peter Kay chose wines to match our food. The first course, scallops, was accompanied by a La Carriere chardonnay. The second course, wild boar terrine, came with a glass of Ma Danseuse pinot noir, made from grapes grown on the estate’s Ma Danseuse vineyard. Sir Peter named it as a love note to his wife, Maggie, whom he met at a dance school in Croydon in the late 1950s.
In the 1976 Judgment of Paris – a one-off blind tasting competition organised by a British wine merchant – California chardonnays and cabernet sauvignons ran away with the top prizes, proving to the world that Californian wine had arrived. That was the year that Sir Peter, entertaining business associates at the Fairmont San Francisco hotel, tasted a top-end Chateau Montelena from Napa and was hooked. Yet even today, relatively few Californian wines are sold in Britain – something the pioneering winemaker is keen to change. “Wine," he insists, “is social networking for civilised people; it is Facebook for those who want to have a life. The story begins in the vineyard, and after the bottle is opened, people tell their friends. The two greatest products to come out of the Golden State are technology and wine."
Our next stop was Schramsberg, the second-oldest winery in California. Situated just over the hills, on the Napa County side of the mountains, it is set in a landscape of lily ponds and has a fascinating history. In 1862 Jacob Schramsberg, a German immigrant, planted a vineyard up in the hills. A few years later he hired unemployed Chinese labourers, left stranded by the completion of the transcontinental railroad, to hand-dig a series of caves through the hillsides, in which to store his wines.
Fast forward 150 years and those caves, in which the pick-marks of those labourers can still be seen, have been expanded. Inside are 2.7 million bottles of top-notch cabernet sauvignons as well as some of California’s best sparkling wines: an oenologist’s Fort Knox. One sparkling wine, the 2005 JSchram ($210/£130) was listed by the American Robb Report magazine as one of the top 18 wines in the world.
Since 1972, when President Nixon took several cases to China on his breakthrough visit to meet Chairman Mao, the brand has been a White House favourite. The Prince and Princess of Wales drank Schramsberg with Ronald Reagan in 1985; Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh shared a Brut Rosé with George W Bush in 2007; and the Obamas have served Schramsberg at a number of state functions.
Having sampled a few of the wines myself, I spent the night at Auberge du Soleil in the hills above the little Napa town of Rutherford. Its rooms, in adobe bungalow style, are scattered up the hillside; its landscaped gardens, planted with semi-tropical flowers, are dotted with metal sculptures placed discreetly among the trees and shrubs.
One thing you notice in Napa County is an obsessive attention to detail, with an emphasis on absolute numerical precision – as befits a wineland so intertwined with the fortunes of high-tech high-flyers. At Auberge du Soleil, the pool is maintained at exactly 27 degrees. In the acclaimed restaurant, presided over by chef Robert Curry, $175 gets you an ounce, to the dot, of caviar.
My dinner there comprised lobster, a shot glass full of creamy fennel soup, halibut, squab (with a far from local Chteauneuf du Pape), steak pavé the rich purple of a Roman imperial toga, and dainty chocolate dumplings encircled by vanilla ice cream and drizzled with olive oil.
The great Californian essayist Joan Didion once wrote that “great hotels have always been social ideas, flawless mirrors to the particular societies they service". Auberge du Soleil’s society is the Google-and-Facebook crowd – wealthy but casual, as reluctant to turn up for a $500 dinner in a jacket and tie as to show up driving a Rolls-Royce. They wear jeans and drive Subarus or Teslas, and they expect to be given a wine menu on an iPad, not on printed paper. At Auberge, they are not disappointed.
Next day we visited the Rudd estate, owned by the family behind the Dean&DeLuca deli chain. Its entrance is formal, wood-panelled and old-worldly, but underground all is modern. The cellars are antiseptically clean, lined with concrete and containing smooth, giant concrete eggs in which some of the wines are fermented. Visitors pay $80 for a food-and-wine tasting that often includes produce from the Rudds’ own gardens. In those gardens stand eight ancient olive trees, each brought by helicopter from Humboldt County, 200 miles away.
Rudd produces a terrific set of reds, including the noted Rudd Oakville Estate Red, but my favourite was Samantha’s Cabernet Sauvignon, named after proprietor Leslie Rudd’s daughter. Having just been shown around the estate by Samantha, it seemed only polite to have a drink in her honour.
The final winery on my list was the Honig estate, a casual, family-run affair noted for its environmental sustainability. The Honigs don’t use fertilisers or pesticides, and instead rely heavily on bringing in birds to eat pests that threaten the vines. In German, Honig means honey – hence the bee logo on the estate’s bottles. My favourite here was a dessert wine made from sauvigon blanc grapes, grown near the Napa River and affected by the botrytis fungus which lends the wine a delicious honeysuckle flavour. It would be the perfect partner to foie gras, said winemaker Stephanie Honig, our host.
On our final evening in Napa County, we stopped in the town of St Helena. It was far too hot to go hiking in the hills, too hot even to stroll through town. We passed half an hour sampling olive oils out of shot glasses at Long Meadow Ranch, including the pricey but delicious Prato Lungo, made from olives grown on ancient trees and, with its peppery kick, ideal for dipping bread in before dinner.
That took place at Solbar, the Michelin-starred restaurant at Solage Calistoga. They seated us outside, next to a long fire pit and opposite an Olympic-size pool ringed by palm trees. I ordered salad followed by duck confit, with yet another fine local cabernet. Dessert was an over-the-top bread pudding, with a dolphin-shaped scoop of vanilla ice cream and an apple crisp on top.
My friend looked up. “That’s Joe Montana," he said quietly. And it was. There at the table next to us was America’s most famous footballer. We raised our glasses and toasted wine country. It was time to head back to the real world.
