Desperate' move mocked
UKIP leader Nigel Farage has sparked uproar after adopting a BNP slogan as his new election battle cry.
He launched the "Love Britain, Vote Ukip" motto at his party's crucial spring conference, declaring: "It's ours now."
It prompted BNP leader Nick Griffin to brand Ukip a "BBC-produced knockoff copy of the BNP's genuine alternative to the out-of-touch old parties".
Labour MP Simon Danczuk blasted: "Ukip is becoming more extreme in a desperate attempt to win some votes from the public. I think the vast majority of people will see through that — as was the case with the BNP."
But Mr Farage defended the motto, saying: "We're claiming that territory and do you know what? To hell with the BNP or anybody else.
"It's our slogan now. Not changing it, keeping it for ever."
In a speech in Torquay, Devon, he railed against mass immigration and bemoaned the lack of English spoken on London trains. He added: "This isn't the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."
He insisted his party could pull off the "biggest political shock" in years by coming top in May's European elections.
And he claimed Ukip was on track to get a "good number" of MPs into Westminster next year. Mr Farage said his party forced David Cameron into committing to an in-out referendum on EU membership by 2017. He said: "Without Ukip there would be no debate, there would be no referendum.
"We carry the hopes now of countless millions on our shoulders."
Mr Farage also said he would quit as Ukip leader if his party did not win a Westminster seat next year.
