GEORGE OSBORNE’S father-in-law has branded the Government’s immigration policies NASTY.
Tory peer Lord Howell said the country had to be seen to be open for business – and the current approach was clobbering trade and tourism.
Unveiling a Lords committee report into how Britain can boost its image, he blasted immigration rules for blocking skilled workers and talented students.
He said: “We’re not getting it right.
“All our witnesses... and a vast amount of written evidence said the visa policy and some of the handling of immigration policy was creating rather a block, creating a nasty Britain feeling."
The report claims Britain’s current stance on immigration is damaging our reputation for “openness" around the world.
And it called for students to be exempt from net migration targets, despite alarming evidence at the number of bogus students flooding to the UK.
Lord Howell was dubbed “Lord Howler" last summer when he said the first fracking sites should be in the North East – because it’s “desolate".
He said the shale gas revolution should not be inflicted on the “beautiful South".
No.10's official spokeswoman refused to be drawn on the criticism.
She said the Government’s priority was to have a “controlled immigration system that allows the best and brightest" to enter Britain.
