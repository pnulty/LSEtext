Ellis Island just off the coast of Manhattan has been since its opening in 1892 the very symbol of the American dream and a rarely seen collection of photographs by acclaimed chronicler of the era Lewis Hine captures the moment of wonder in the eyes of countless immigrants as they first arrived to the United States.
Hine's photographs are a slice of American life cut just as what it meant to be American was being invented.
His subjects, dressed in the exotic local garb of mostly Eastern and Southern Europe, would go on to become the founding mothers and fathers of communities across the continent that exist to this day.
The photographer was never seen as an artist by his contemporaries, but the intense humanity with which he imbued each of his subjects--an Armenian Jew fleeing persecution, a little Italian girl touching her first American penny, three generations of Slavic women smiling together--makes clear that he deserved such a title all along.
