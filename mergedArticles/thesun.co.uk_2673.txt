DAVID CAMERON’s hopes of tackling immigration in Europe were dealt a blow today by Italy’s new Prime Minister.
Matteo Renzi told a packed Downing Street press conference his overwhelming priority was tackling red-tape and bureaucracy.
He said that questions about “the rest" - such as benefits claimed by migrants travelling within the EU - could wait until later.
In broken English, Mr Renzi said: “In the last period Europe lost the quality of dream and became only a place of bureaucracy and red-tape.
“So for this I believe the first challenge is to discuss Europe as a place of freedom."
Just last week the Germans offered a huge boost to the PM by revealing plans which detailed proposals to boot out EU migrants who fail to land a job within three months.
Despite his comments, Mr Renzi insisted the UK had to remain a key part of the European Union.
The Italian premier - who took over as PM in February - said: “There can not be a great Europe without the UK, without David Cameron and all the British people. There’s no question, it’s essential, it’s critical."
Net migration figures earlier this year revealed 18,000 Italians came to the UK last year - second highest among all EU member states behind Poland.
