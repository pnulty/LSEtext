BRITISH AIRWAYS supremo Willie Walsh today called on the Government to change its immigration rules because "so many people want to come to London, but don't because they struggle with the visa regime".
Mr Walsh, who runs IAG, the airlines group which owns BA, added: "It's so much easier for them to go elsewhere. London is losing out because of the visa regime. We understand the UK has to have strong borders, but you need better systems in place for business people who want to travel here and tourists who want to visit here. People want to experience London, in part because of what they saw during the Olympics."
BA launched a new route to Chengdu, a strong business region in south central China last year, and Mr Walsh added: "It's Chinese tourists particularly who find it difficult to come to the UK.
"They are still coming, and that shows how strong the number of visitors could be, as the Chinese going through the difficulties of travelling here.
"But if it was easier we'd see a massive increase in tourists from China â€” and that would benefit the economy."
