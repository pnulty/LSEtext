Inquiries into strict Islamic practices in some Birmingham schools were widened again yesterday as a former head teacher was appointed to lead the investigation.
However, there was confusion over comments by Mark Rogers, the city council's chief executive, in which he rejected claims of a plot by hardline Muslims to infiltrate schools.
Mr Rogers told a Birmingham blogger that inquiries so far had found problems in some city schools but attributed these to "cultural" traditions within immigrant communities at odds with England's liberal education and parts of the national curriculum.
A new statement by the council said that its inquiry now spanned 25 city schools and 200 testimonies or pieces of evidence. It has appointed Ian Kershaw, managing director of Northern Education, as chief adviser. Claims include the segregation of girls from boys and extremist themes in some lessons.
