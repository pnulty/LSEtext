BRITAIN could face legal action over its latest curb on benefits for EU immigrants, Brussels warned yesterday.
From Saturday, EU migrants will have to show they have earned at least Â£149 a week for three months in the UK to qualify for benefits.
But EU Employment Commissioner Laszlo Andor said it could contravene EU law - in which case it would be challenged. He said the EU would have to look at it in detail first but the Government should "think twice" before launching such initiatives, adding: "That can lead to conflict."
He told the BBC that British MPs had "not really minded" that their statements in recent months were at odds with the legal principles of the EU.
Meanwhile, Lib-Dem leader Nick Clegg said he would like to see a six-month wait for migrant jobless benefits in his party's 2015 manifesto.
