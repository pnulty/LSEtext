RECORD VIEW
MHAIRI McDonald is the kind of young Scot we'd like to think is reflective of our nation.
Socially conscious, internationally aware, the 24-year-old slept rough on the streets of Glasgow for a night to raise money for the Street Child World Cup in Brazil.
While she was on Sauchiehall Street for the night, she was racially abused by five separate passers-by, representatives of a mindless minority who are infected with bigotry.
Sadly, this is not an isolated incident. There are ignorant racists in our midst and we shouldn't pretend otherwise.
The morons who hurled abuse at Mhairi missed the point. She is born and bred in Scotland and not the immigrant they assumed her to be - which just goes to show the depth of their stupidity.
Mhairi is the true Scot and representative of the vast majority of decent people in this country of ours.
There can be no place in Scotland for the people who abused her.
