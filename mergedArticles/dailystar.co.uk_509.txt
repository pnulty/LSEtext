BRITAIN will snub EU rules and ban immigrants from claiming benefits for up to a year, Iain Duncan Smith vowed yesterday.
Foreigners can currently claim thousands in handouts within weeks of arriving so long as they do a minimal amount of work.
It has sparked fears that hordes could come here to claim taxpayers’ cash using fake jobs.
But the Work and Pensions Secretary believes the Government must bring in tougher rules on foreign workers “regardless of what the European Commission tries to tell us”.
He said the Tories want to “go further” in clamping down on Britain’s benefits free-for-all.
A source
And a source close to the minister said: “Iain believes that nation states should be able to set their own rules. He thinks the limit should go up to six months or over a year.”
For now, the Government will stop migrants getting handouts unless they have been in Britain for three months and are earning at least £150 a week.
Mr Duncan Smith said the move, which will come into force this month, would stop people “taking advantage” of the welfare system.
He said: “We have also clamped down on those trying to manipulate the tax credit system.
“For too long it has been a source of income for those in bogus jobs or falsely declaring themselves self-employed.
“Now, until those who come here start paying National Insurance contribution, individuals must prove to us that they are working in a real job.”
