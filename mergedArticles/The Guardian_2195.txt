Seumas Milne concludes Crimeans must have the chance to choose their own future (Comment, 6 March). Fair point. However, we know from Chechnya how brutally Putin can deal with dissatisfied minorities. The west would be criminally negligent if we allowed Crimea to become Russian without rock-solid safeguards for the region's Tatars and Ukrainians.

* Your report (Minister's speech turns spotlight on nationality of PM's staff, 7 March) could also have pointed out that Cameron employs an Aussie immigrant as his puppet master. Then there is the Canadian immigrant running the Bank of England and the New Zealand immigrant in charge of RBS. Away from politics, we have in the Premier League perhaps Arsenal immigrants against Chelsea immigrants. Let's use the word in all cases where it applies and we might understand it a bit better.

* How is it that any one with an iPad or smartphone can track hundreds of thousands of ships throughout the world using a free "app", and the Justice ministry can't follow 20,000 offenders (Report, 6 March)?

1/15 Razmig Keucheyan makes some good points (Comment, 7 March) about capitalism's response to ecological crises, but for the social consequences you can't do better than Margaret Atwood in her Oryx and Crake trilogy. It's also a hugely enjoyable read.

* Carol Ann Duffy's poem Mrs Schofield's GCSE (G2, 4 April) brought to mind what is surely a still more telling response to the mismatch between poetry and the requirements of an exam, FH Townsend's parody of Wordsworth: O cuckoo, shall I call thee bird/ Or but a wandering voice?/ State the alternative preferred/ With reasons for your choice

* I never knew Mike Parker (Letters, 7 March) but he sounded like a decent type.
