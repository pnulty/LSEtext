FOURTEEN illegal immigrants have been arrested after being caught workling in restaurants in Argyll.
The Bangladeshi men were nabbed during raids in Lochgilphead, Tarbert, Inverary, Ardrishaig and Islay.
The Home Office said they are being held until they are deported.
Last month 16 men were detained by immigration officers after a swoop on restaurants in the north of Scotland.
