The 19-year-old from Mali can be seen climbing out of the bag looking confused as he realises where he is.
A 39-year-old Moroccan man had been dragging the large blue luggage at a checkpoint between the Spanish enclave of Melilla and Morocco in North Africa.
Noticing that the man kept stumbling, Guardia Civil agents asked him to stop.
He ignored the demand and dumped the case on the floor before running towards Melilla.
Man climbs out of suitcase
But officers caught him 150 metres from the checkpoint.
Taken back to the border, the man was forced to watch as police opened up the suitcase.
Guardia Civil spokesman Juan Antonio Martin Rivera said officers first thought a rare animal could have been inside the case.
Mr Rivera added: “He was tall, thin and muscly. We’re not talking about a small person here."
The 39-year-old, named only by his initials NN and who has a home in the northern Spanish city of Lleida, was arrested.
The unharmed teen was taken to a temporary immigration holding centre and is expected to testify at a later date against the alleged trafficker.
