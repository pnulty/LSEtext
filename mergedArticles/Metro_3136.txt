NICK CLEGG is taking the fight to Ukip today claiming his coalition colleagues are 'missing in action' in the war on 'populists and xenophobes'.
The deputy prime minister will be launching the Liberal Democrat campaign for next month's European elections with a speech to the party faithful in Colchester.
With Ukip hoping to top next month's poll, and the Lib Dems fearing a wipeout, Mr Clegg will renew his attacks on the anti-EU party claiming that 'the fight is on'.
He will say: 'Ukip and others have been allowed to peddle their myths unchallenged for decades, claiming that all of our problems would magically disappear if the UK just left the EU.
'But it's a dangerous fantasy. It's the surest way to jeopardise jobs, risk our fragile economic recovery, and it will leave Britain alone and diminished in the world.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage chose Mr Clegg's home city of Shef-field for his party's campaign launch on Tuesday, with posters claiming that 26million Europeans were after British jobs. He was left fending off claims of racism and hit back last night in his party's first election broadcast of the campaign. He claimed that immigration would bring another 3million people into Britain by 2020.
On a visit to a pub in Yarm, Stocktonon-Tees, yesterday he called on voters to 'join our people's army and cause an earthquake in British politics'.
Meanwhile, the fall-out continued from the row over his German-born wife whom he employs as a secretary in his role as an MEP.
He claimed that no British person could - or would want to - do the job.
But employment agency Xpat Jobs advertised the role yesterday and attracted 764 applications in 12 hours - 649 of them from Britain.
