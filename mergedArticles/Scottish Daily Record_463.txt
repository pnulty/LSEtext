THE ridiculous visa wrangle facing Scots mum Kirsty Miller shows just how complicated and cruel the UK's immigration system has become.
The pregnant 30-year-old is desperate to return home to Glasgow and bring her American husband and baby twins with her.
It is a natural emotion that many mothers will recognise - the desire to raise your children near to where you grew up.
But harsh new immigration rules mean Kirsty has to have a guaranteed job in Scotland before she will be allowed to do so.
Changes to the law in 2012 mean loving family relations are now considered less important than how much you earn. This cannot be right.
As a British citizen wanting to bring her American husband to live in Scotland, Kirsty has to earn at least £18,600 in the States and have the offer of a job earning the same back in the UK.
And because her husband Daniel is an American, his £31,180 salary working in the beer brewing trade isn't taken into account.
That means the devastated Strathclyde University graduate may have to travel back to Scotland alone to have her new baby - and then find a job that earns enough to allow her to bring over her husband and children.
This is despite the fact Daniel was previously granted a visa to live and work in the UK.
It is shocking that people born and raised in Scotland are having to jump through hoops like this just to enjoy a normal life with their loved ones.
In recent years, there has been a lot of heated debate over the ease with which people from other parts of the EU have been able to move to Scotland to work.
But it is the way the immigration system is treating our own citizens that shows it is not fit for purpose.
