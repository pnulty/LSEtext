Less than half of the homes in Britain will be lived in by the people who own them within 20 years, a report warns, as young people find it increasingly hard to get on the housing ladder.
An analysis of current housing trends suggests that by 2032 only 49.2 per cent of the housing stock will be owner-occupied, down from 64.2 per cent in 2012.
At the same time, the private rental sector will have grown 17.7 per cent to 35.2 per cent - while social rented properties will be broadly unchanged at about 15 per cent of the total housing stock.
The research was carried out by the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association, which said the trend was being fuelled by the growing obstacles to homeownership, changes in employment, high levels of immigration, later marriage and rising separation rates.
