Publisher Notice: Correction: IN an article "PM Backs Migrants" (12 May) we stated that figures from Oxford University's Migration Observatory are set to show an extra 30,000 Bulgarian and Romanian workers were living in the UK in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. In fact the figures were issued by the Office For National Statistics.
ANOTHER 30k HERE BUT.. Cam defends 'free movement'
DAVID Cameron has defended the free movement of EU migrants - amid warnings thousands more Bulgarians and Romanians have moved to Britain.
The PM sparked concern from Tory backbenchers as he declared the free movement principle was "important" ahead of vital local and European elections on May 22.
It comes after The Sun demanded that he makes immigration control a red line in his battle to win back powers from Brussels.
Figures out this week from Oxford University's Migration Observatory are set to show an extra 30,000 Bulgarian and Romanian workers were living in the UK in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
In the last quarter of 2013, there were 144,000 people - including workers and their family members - from the two countries in Britain. With 30,000 more workers expected to have arrived, the total with family members now is likely to have soared over 200,000. Restrictions on migrants coming to the UK from Romania and Bulgaria were lifted on January 1. Mr Cameron said: "I think free movement within the European Union is important. "But it needs to be returned to the original concept - the freedom to be able to go and work in another country."
His defence of the EU's key principle will worry Tories concerned about the rise of Ukip. David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouth, warned: "It doesn't make sense to bring people in to work when there are people here looking for jobs." The PM is renegotiating a return of powers from the EU ahead of a planned in-out referendum in 2017.
Q MR Cameron yesterday said he may call for Britain to LEAVE the EU if Brussels refuses to hand back powers. Asked if he would give a clear indication on how he wanted Brits to vote in the referendum, he said: "I won't sit on the fence."
