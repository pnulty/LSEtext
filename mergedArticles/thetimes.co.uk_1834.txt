Thousands of people have signed a petition for a Leeds woman facing deportation who claims that her daughters aged five and two will become victims of female genital mutilation if they are returned to Nigeria.
Afusat Saliu fled to the UK in 2012 when her stepmother said that her eldest daughter Bassy would have to be cut. She was heavily pregnant with her younger daughter Rashidat at the time.
The Home Office has issued Ms Saliu with a removal date of April 25 despite claims that she and her daughters are also vulnerable to retribution from a “violent and dangerous” man, 40 years her senior, from whom Ms Saliu escaped a forced marriage.
An online petition, which was launched on the website change.org on Saturday, has now gained more than 52,000 signatures and has received the backing of Greg Mullholland MP, George Mudie MP and Felicity Gerry QC.
Mr Mulholland, a vocal campaigner for women and girls at risk of FGM, has written to the Home Office asking it to reconsider Ms Saliu’s case.
Anj Handa, director at People help People and author of the petition to review Ms Saliu’s asylum case, said that the mother of two is “a real asset to our society”.
“She helps out at their school and volunteers with the Refugee Council and other organisations to support women in a similar position,” said Ms Handa.
“It suits the system to dehumanise all immigrants and treat them as grasping individuals, but that is not the case with Afusat. She is a single mother with two young daughters who are all at risk of violence if they are returned to Nigeria.”
