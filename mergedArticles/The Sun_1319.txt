A LIB Dem health minister has sparked fresh uproar by insisting high immigration is vital to prevent elderly care collapsing.
Norman Lamb's controversial intervention comes after Business Secretary Vince Cable infuriated Tory MPs by WELCOMING a massive 212,000 leap in foreign arrivals last year.
Care and Support Minister Mr Lamb backed him, saying: "The care system would collapse without workers from other countries. It is tempting to claim these people are coming to take our benefits but most are doing pretty vital jobs." But MigrationWatch UK boss Sir Andrew Green said last night: "With over two million unemployed, our focus should be getting young workers into entry level jobs, not slagging them off."
Soaring immigration has left the PM's election pledge to get numbers down to tens of thousands in tatters.
Migration Observatory chief Scott Blinder said: "The figures make clear net migration is not something that can be delivered purely through policy."
