A Polish MP who travelled to London to experience life as an immigrant is now in trouble with his parliament because of money he earned in Britain.
Artur Debski spent two weeks sleeping on floors, looking for work and taking temporary jobs such as painting and decorating in an effort to understand why so many Poles prefer to move to Britain. The parliament has declared that he may have broken rules prohibiting MPs taking undeclared paid work. Mr Debski earned £280 for six days' work.
