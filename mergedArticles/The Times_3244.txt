Further restrictions are to be placed on the access EU migrants have to benefits in an attempt by ministers to stem public concerns about immigration. EU workers coming to Britain already have to wait three months before receiving unemployment benefits, under emergency measures introduced in January. However, the Treasury has now ruled that they should also wait three months before being eligible for child benefit and child tax credits.
The ruling comes before next month's European elections, when the Tories are set to be beaten by Ukip. Nigel Farage's party has made EU immigration the main theme of its campaign, and could return the most MEPs.
The decision to make migrants wait for benefits was made after public concerns about potential mass migration from Bulgaria and Romania. Restrictions on the movement of workers from the two Eastern European countries were lifted at the start of the year.
David Cameron has already said that he wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for children living overseas. He wants to secure the measure as part of his pledge to loosen Britain's ties with the EU.
