ATHLETES GET EXIT DEADLINE
A TEAM has been set up to stop foreigners exploiting the Commonwealth Games to stay in Britain illegally.
More than, 6,500 athletes from 71 countries, as well as home-grown stars like Eilish McColgan, will be in Scotland for the country's biggest ever sports and cultural event.
Along with training staff, coaches, offi-cials and journalists, they will form a group dubbed Games Family Members.
Normal visa requirements will be relaxed to make it easier for athletes to compete, but all visitors will be expected to leave the country within a month of the Games ending. But dozens of athletes and backroom staff have done a runner during and following previous events and claimed asylum or stayed illegally in Britain.
After the London Olympics two years ago, nearly 80 people, including Mandembo Kebika Cedric from Congo's judo team, either claimed asylum or asked to stay.
Immigration lawyer Stuart McWilliams said: "It's certainly possible when you have as many athletes in the Commonwealth Games as we are expecting, as well as coaches, that some will claim asylum."
