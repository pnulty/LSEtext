A Nobel prizewinning scientist says that he dislikes students, who are "absolutely ignorant" until they have matured. Professor Sir Andre Geim said it took two or three years of a PhD until he found them interesting enough to be treated like colleagues.
The physicist, interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, said: "I don't like students very much. They come absolutely ignorant and they are not grown up yet as interesting people."
However, during their PhD they grow "exponentially", pick up experiences and become "real". "After that, we become, not like a professor and a student, we become like colleagues," said the Regius Professor of Physics at the University of Manchester.
The Soviet Union-born scientist believes that students should be exempt from new immigration laws. "We should try and draw from the resources outside this country, try and bring the brightest minds to compete in the future world and the future of the country is where the brains are."
Professor Geim, 55, spent his early year with his grandmother, who had a weather station on the beach. He was awarded the Nobel prize for experiments on the material graphene, alongside Sir Konstantin Novoselov. As a student, Professor Geim skipped lectures and aimed for "maximum percentage from minimum effort".
