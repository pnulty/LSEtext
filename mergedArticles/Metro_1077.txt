THE longlist for the James Tait Black prize for drama is announced today - including themes ranging from TV game shows and gangsters to online dating and immigration. The 14 nominations showcase a range of diverse productions from new and established writers. The prize was launched in 2012 by Edinburgh University in partnership with the National Theatre of Scotland and the Traverse. The longlist for the £10,000 prize was chosen from more than 180 plays worldwide. Scottish playwrights win the most nominations, with David Harrower, David Leddy, Rob Drummond and AJ Taudevin on the longlist. Past winners include DH Lawrence and Aldous Huxley. An award ceremony will take place at the Traverse in August.
