WINNING work from scandal-hit rival Serco helped security firm Mitie post a 21pc rise in annual profits.
Mitie picked up a £180m contract with the Home Office to run immigration centres at Heathrow - work previously done by its embattled peer.
Serco and G4S have both been criticised after charging the taxpayer for monitoring criminals who turned out to be dead. Both faced blacklisting last year until they could convince ministers they had undergone 'corporate renewal'.
Mitie's annual pre-tax profits rose 21pc to £68.4m on sales that grew 4.7pc to £2.2bn.
The company took a £25.4m financial hit after quitting its engineering and construction support businesses. Losses at its energy arm deepened from £1.4m to £4.4m.
Boss Ruby McGregor-Smith said the company was not signing any new deals in the division.
But she remained bullish over the future of outsourcing, adding: 'The outlook in the next five years in the UK particularly is becoming increasingly positive.'
Shares, which have risen by 15pc in the last 12 months, climbed 7.3p to 318.3p.
