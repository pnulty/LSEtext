Migration from eastern Europe was underestimated by hundreds of thousands because of flaws in the way the numbers were calculated, statisticans admitted yesterday.
The Office for National Statistics failed to count an estimated 350,000 immigrants between 2001 and 2011 because of "inadequate sampling" in a key survey carried out at airports.
Most of the immigrants missed from the International Passenger Survey (IPS) were from the eight former Soviet bloc countries, including Poland, which joined the European Union in 2004.
Revised figures estimate net migration over the decade at more than 2.5 million compared with the earlier estimate of just under 2.2 million.
The revision suggests that overall net migration — the difference between the number of those entering Britain and the number of those who left — during Labour's term in office was more than 3.8 million.
Original estimates were low because the ONS focused on interviewing passengers at principal airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester, when many east Europeans were arriving on cheap flights to regional airports. The report suggests that the ONS missed a "substantial amount of immigration" of so-called EU8 citizens between 2004 and 2008.
It said: "During this time, many migrants from the EU8 countries were travelling on the increasing number of routes connecting their countries with the UK regional airports. Many of these routes were not covered, or not fully covered, by the IPS for migration purposes prior to 2009." However, it adds that the survey's coverage has since improved.
The report also suggests that there is evidence that estimates of the number of child migrants under 15 are too low but does not indicate by how much.
Revisions mean that net migration was at a record annual high in 2007, when 273,000 people arrived as part of what was the biggest influx in UK history. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were allowed full and immediate access to the UK labour market when they joined the EU.
At the time, research for the Home Office suggested that about 13,000 migrants a year would arrive from the eight states, although it warned that the figures must be treated with caution.
Carlos Vargas Silva, senior researcher at the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory, said: "We have known for some time that net migration must have been much higher during the 2001-11 period than the official estimates suggested.
"This report provides important evidence of the need for better migration data and of the limitations of using a survey to develop net migration data."
Sir Andrew Green, the chairman of Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for lower immigration, said: "This is final confirmation that net foreign immigration under Labour totalled nearly 4 million, two thirds from outside the EU. It also shows that the peak of net migration was almost 275,000 a year, making it even more difficult for the present government to get the numbers down to the tens of thousands."
