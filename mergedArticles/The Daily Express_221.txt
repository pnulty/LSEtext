BY THE WAY
IMMIGRATION has reached insane levels and the result is Britain's population will soon be completely changed because minorities are having more children than the natives. We forget, however, that all this has happened several times before, admittedly long ago.
I wonder if it would make a vast difference to unemployment if immigration were totally stopped. I'm not convinced that jobless Britons would race to take up vacancies. There are generations who have never worked and been, if not happy, at least content to idle away their lives. The welfare state has made that happen.
Eastern Europeans mostly come here prepared to work. Some will inevitably join the benefits brigade but thousands of them are doing jobs that Britons don't want and doing them well. Just ask employers whom they prefer. We need to face the truth.
