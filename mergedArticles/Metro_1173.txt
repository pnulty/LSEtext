MINISTERS fuelled racial hatred by refusing to do anything to stop a stream of false claims about immigrants, MPs say.
They are accused of playing 'into the hands of those who wanted to inflame tensions' by failing to get accurate estimates of the number of eastern Europeans heading to Britain.
Instead, the government allowed stories about a surge in benefit tourism, pickpocketing, muggings, beggars on the streets, rioting and even people coming to this country to sell their babies to go uncorrected, the MPs allege.
In fact, the numbers of Bulgarians and Romanians who came to Britain when controls were lifted was 'more of a trickle than a flood'.
MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: 'The government's failure to commission an estimate of these numbers has led to unnecessary anti-immigrant prejudice and is a blot on our tolerant society.' Restrictions were lifted at the turn of the year, prompting a host of scare stories, such as reports of fully-booked flights and coaches from Bucharest and Sofia. Weeks earlier, David Cameron rushed through legislation limiting immigrants' rights to benefits but the committe said there was little evidence of widespread benefits tourism.
The Home Office rejected the allegations, saying: 'Any forecasts would have lacked all credibility. The failure of previous attempts to predict likely numbers only contributed to the public's concern over uncontrolled immigration.'
