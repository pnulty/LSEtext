As part of a series of concerts marking the 50th anniversary of Nonesuch records, Devendra Banhart awkwardly delivered his wry songs while Rokia Traoré's powerful, well-structured performance was a class act
Over the next two weeks the Barbican mounts a series of concerts marking the 50th anniversary of Nonesuch records. The American label is home to a diverse range of artists from Emmylou Harris to the Kronos Quartet, from Brad Mehldau to Natalie Merchant. It kicked off on Saturday night with Devendra Banhart and Rokia Traoré.
It was the first live show I’d seen from Venezuelan-born, Houston Texas resident Banhart. With just him and his electric guitar, it was a bit like being invited into an awkward student’s bedroom to hear some rambling thoughts and fragmentary songs. Wry songs such as Never Seen Such Good Things Go So Wrong and Won’t You Come Over were delivered straight but vulnerably and got huge applause. But the Nonesuch PR must have squirmed through his admission that he couldn’t remember anything about the label and his long wait at UK immigration.
It was a relief when Malian songstress Rokia Traoré just launched into her music with a tight band. She’s a small lady with a big guitar, and delivered a powerful, well-structured show from the slowly-building Dounia to the title song from her recent Beautiful Africa album. A class act.
