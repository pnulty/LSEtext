Policy in tatters as coalition bicker
COALITION policy on immigration will be pushed to the verge of complete collapse today in a blazing row over EU migrants.
Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable will tear into his Tory partners — claiming they are being "medieval" in tackling immigrants.
He will insist that cutting EU arrivals to the UK could threaten the entire economic recovery. And he will add: "Bear down on immigrants and you lose some of the most dynamic, innovative and imaginative workers in your economy."
But just hours earlier Mr Cable, right, will be ridiculed by a Government colleague — Tory Immigration Minister James Brokenshire. He will rubbish the Lib Dem's claims that rising migration is "good news" for the economy.
And he will tell a think tank conference: "In the past year, net migration from the EU has doubled — and this figure is frankly just too high. Some have tried to claim that this rapid increase is somehow 'good' for the country. Well, just like the Home Secretary, I disagree."
Mr Brokenshire will signal he wants a further crackdown on bogus students at British universities.
The row follows claims that Downing Street suppressed a report which claims the effects of immigration on British workers is overstated.
