NIGEL Farage is gunning for Labour, and Ed Miliband must be starting to sweat.
Hosting a huge Ukip rally at a racecourse on Red Ed's doorstep in Doncaster typifies the anti-EU party's brash attitude.
But the intention is not just to give the Labour leader a bloody nose.
As Farage moves away from the fruitcakes on Ukip's fringe, he knows that to return an MP ANYWHERE he must win over punters who feel more and more remote from Westminster's elite.
He believes his opposition to an open door on immigration will chime with fed-up Labour voters.
But it won't be all plain sailing for Nigel, ironically because his party is tipped to score a big victory in May's Euro poll.
That will mean many more of his cronies heading to Brussels with HUGE salaries and expense accounts.
We'll be paying for them to enjoy a ripe old time on the EU gravy train.
It's fine to pull up Labour for not committing to an EU referendum.
But if it looks like Nige and his chums are lining their pockets while condemning others for the same thing, he won't be a "man of the people" for long.
