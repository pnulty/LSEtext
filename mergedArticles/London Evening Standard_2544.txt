VINCE CABLE v JAMES BROKENSHIRE Ground: Immigration Kick-off: Noon In a neat lift of Peter Mandelson's taboo-busting comment about the filthy rich, Business Secretary Cable declared he is "intensely relaxed" about immigration.

Brokenshire, the seemingly mildmannered Immigration minister pulled on knuckle-dusters to warn that "uncontrolled mass immigration can force wages down and house prices up and put pressure on social cohesion and public services".
