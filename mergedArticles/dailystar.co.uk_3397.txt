X-MEN actor Sir Ian McKellen has said Nigel Farage "needs to get out more" after the Ukip leader said most over-70s were uncomfortable with homosexuality.
Sir Ian McKellen
The claim was made after Farage defended Roger Helmer, the Ukip by-election candidate in Newark, who has stated the public should be able to dislike gay people, as you might different sorts of tea.
Farage referenced Helmer's "strong Christian Bible background" while saying "if we asked the 70s and over in this country how they felt about it, most of them still feel uncomfortable".
In a Channel 4 interview Sir Ian McKellen was keen to rebuff Farage and his party's reported anti-gay stance.
He said: "Those nasty words which come out of people's mouths is just shouting into the wind.
"But people will shout louder and louder because they're so frustrated as they know their opinions and prejudices are not confirmed by the rest of society.
"I'm very optimistic that things are changing here. Not everywhere in the world."
When asked specifically about Farage's comment about over-70s Sir Ian said: "Well he hasn't spoken to this seventy-year-old. Or this one [pointing at Patrick Stewart].
"I think frankly Farage needs to get out more."
Sir Ian is a prominent activist for gay rights. He has been famously photographed in a "Some people are gay get over it" Stonewall t-shirt.
An photoshopped image of him wearing a "I'm Gandalf and Magneto, get over it" t-shirt went viral in 2010.
