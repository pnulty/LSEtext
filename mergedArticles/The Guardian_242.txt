* When listing the ways the government tries to wriggle out of its obligation to provide a safety net to the unemployed, Zoe Williams might have added a bizarre definition of "immigrant" of which my stepson was recently a victim. In spite of being a British citizen who had spent 25 of his 27 years of life in the UK, on returning from a two-year working holiday in Australia he was told he'd have to wait three months before he would be entitled to any benefits. If he hadn't a family to support him, what was he supposed to do?
