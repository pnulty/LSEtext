BRITAIN could be plunged back into an economic crisis over the mammoth surge in house prices.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has identified the UK housing market as posing the “biggest risk” to long-term recovery.
The Canadian said Britain is failing to build enough homes and the Bank was “closely watching” the rise in large-value mortgages.

Mr Carney said twice as many houses are built in his native Canada each year as in the UK.
But he said the Bank of England had no solution to this as it “will not be building houses any time soon”.
On action the Bank could take he said: “We could limit amounts of certain types of mortgages that banks could undertake, we could provide advice, the Chancellor has asked us if we would provide advice on changing the terms of Help to Buy. All those things are possibilities and we will consider them all.”

He added: “What we can influence is whether the banks are strong enough.
“Do they have enough capital against risks in the housing market, whether underwriting standards are tough enough so that people can get mortgages if they can afford them?”
Prime Minister David Cameron said Mr Carney was “absolutely right” that not enough new houses were being built, and said Help to Buy had been “hugely helpful” over new developments.
