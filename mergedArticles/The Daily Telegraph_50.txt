THE Conservatives should change their tone on immigration to appeal to foreign–born voters, according to a campaign led by a Tory backbencher.
The Conservatives for Managed Migration campaign wants to soften Tory rhetoric and policies such as the promise to cut annual net immigration to under 100,000. Mark Field, the MP for Westminster and the City, who is leading the campaign said: "To succeed, the UK must be a magnet for the very best talent."
He added that the Conservatives should appeal to migrants who can vote in British elections. "We have to persuade them that we are not hostile," he said.
