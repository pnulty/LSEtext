NEARLY a third of electors could vote Ukip, research shows.
The figures, released as a book on the party is due to be published tomorrow, will trigger alarm in Labour and Tory ranks.
In their book Revolt On The Right, Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford found discontent with immigration, the EU and politicians were the main reasons voters back Ukip.
Nearly a third shared two of the concerns and a fifth all three.
Dr Goodwin said: "Ukip are winning over the 'left-behind' groups in society. These voters look out at a country they neither recognise nor want to be part of."
Ukip is tipped to win May's EU elections and scored 14 per cent in a YouGov poll yesterday.
Deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: "We speak out about the issues that matter and people are turning to us more and more."
