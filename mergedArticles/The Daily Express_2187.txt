IT REALLY does appear that the Liberal Democrats have a death wish. That is the only conclusion that can be drawn from their recently revealed plans for immigration.
Yesterday it came out that Nick Clegg's party is in favour of a "super grandparents visa" that would make it easier for immigrants to bring their elderly relatives with them. That would open the door to an influx of older immigrants who would be desperate to claim NHS treatment and assorted benefits.
The Lib Dems also suggested removing foreign students from the Government's official migration statistics. This would allow immigrants to flood into Britain using university studies as a flimsy pretext.
Furthermore they also said they would even allow the students to stay in Britain after completing their studies despite graduate employment remaining a problem for many young people who would face an even tougher fight to get their first full–time job.
Clegg and his party already have absolutely no understanding of the problems being caused for British people by the lax immigration policy forced upon us by EU membership. Now they want to make the situation even worse.
