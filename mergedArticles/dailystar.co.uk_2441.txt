A 19stone mum who spends her benefits on grub last night blamed MPs.
Stacey McFarlane, 33
Stacey McFarlane, 33, said she has ballooned because she has £400 a week left from her hand-outs and blows the lot on food.
The size 24 mum-of-three eats out up to five times a week and devours takeaways and steaks.
She wants the government to cut her £1,800-a-month benefits to stop her eating.
Stacey, from Rochdale, Lancs, said: “I’m not a sponger, I’m a hard-working mum. I deserve the odd treat.
“Do they want me to starve? They gave me the money in the first place. Don’t have a go at me!” Local Labour MP Simon Danczuk said it was “ludicrous”.

But Stacey blasted back: “And what does Simon Danczuk know about my eating habits? Who is he to judge?
“It was his Labour government that gave me these benefits in the first place.
“My son has ADHD and he is deaf. That’s why I get so much.”
