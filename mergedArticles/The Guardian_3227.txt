EU migrants to Britain will not be able to claim child benefit or child tax credit until they have lived in the country for three months, George Osborne will announce today. Immigrants already face a three-month wait before they can receive jobseeker's allowance, and access to housing benefit has been banned. EU claimants are eligible for child benefit only if they are earning more than pounds 150 a week.
Entitlement to jobseeker's allowance, child benefit and child tax credit is already restricted for many claimants to a maximum of six months, so the latest announcement means most EU migrants will receive the latter two for between three and six months after arrival. After six months, the Treasury said, only those who have a job offer or compelling evidence they have a genuine chance of finding work will be able to continue claiming.
Conservatives are also looking to see how far they can follow recently announced German proposals to deport any EU migrant who does not have a realistic chance of securing work after six months, regardless of whether they claim benefits. The German move goes to the heart of the principle of free movement of workers within the EU.
The new three-month wait for child benefit and child tax credit, announced by the Treasury last night, will come into force in July. The government also announced that from today EU migrants eligible for jobseeker's allowance will no longer have routine access to interpretation services, and from the end of the month their spoken English will be tested in England. If claimants' language is found to be a barrier to looking for work, they will be expected to improve it.
