SEVEN out of 10 Sunday Express online readers are planning to vote Ukip in next month’s European Parliament elections, a survey has revealed.
It lays bare the true extent of just how much support the Conservatives have lost under David Cameron.
At the 2010 general election 54.8 per cent of Sunday Express readers voted Conservative and only 14.9 per cent backed Ukip.
The survey of 1,000 readers of SundayExpress.co.uk found only 13.8 per cent would vote Tory on May 22, with just 2.2 per cent intending to vote Labour and 1.5 per cent choosing the Liberal Democrats.
Immigration and Europe were the issues 89 per cent said would drive how they vote, while only 6 per cent mentioned the economy.
Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the findings were a “massive boost”.
He said: “To have Sunday Express readers come out so overwhelmingly in our favour signals we’ve struck a chord with middle Britain.”
