GRANT Shapps' assertion that the Government was still aiming to cut annual net immigration to "tens of thousands" is laughable because he and everyone else knows full well that, as long as Britain is signed up to the EU's freedom of movement rules, there is absolutely nothing we can do.
As it is, Britain remains a soft touch, a target for the unscrupulous, rewarding the unworthy while our society continues to fall apart. It is the clear will of the British people that immigration should be brought under control. When will the lofty political class, clearly hoping that their empty promises will silence us, recognise that?
