BIG firms should sign up to a "tough code of conduct" to prevent them exploiting workers on zero-hours contracts, says Ukip leader Nigel Farage.
But he believes the flexibility of zero-hours contracts - which do not guarantee regular work - suited some firms and employees and he did not want to ban them.
It is Farage's latest effort to target working class voters and woo support away from Labour in the run-up to next month's European elections.
Mr Farage wrote in our sister paper the Daily Express: "With so much cheap labour flooding in from abroad, giant corporations are in an increasingly powerful position to dictate terms and conditions."
He added: "Unlimited immigration from eastern Europe and elsewhere has left many British working people pretty much defenceless against constant downgrades in their pay and employment conditions."
