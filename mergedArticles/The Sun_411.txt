MORE than £100MILLION of taxpayers cash a year is being used to fund gold-plated pensions for JUDGES, The Sun can reveal.
Figures for 2012-2013 show the bill topped £102million — up nearly 30 per cent in just two years.
Last night Ministry of Justice officials blamed a sharp increase in retired judges drawing a pension — and longer life expectancy.
Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan said the Government had got its priorities wrong.
He said: "The public will find it hard to believe that more and more is being spent on judges' pensions at a time when they are slashing spending on victims, police, prisons and probation." The Government said Labour did nothing to cut the pensions bill when in power.
Judges had a non-contributory final salary pension until the Coalition forced them to start putting aside part of their pay from 2012.
Yesterday it emerged senior judge Richard McKee, 65, was allowed to "retire" with a full pension after being forced to step down over his links with an illegal immigrant. Q TAXPAYER-FUNDED pensions for councillors, like the one held by Mayor of London Boris Johnson, will be axed from May to save cash.
