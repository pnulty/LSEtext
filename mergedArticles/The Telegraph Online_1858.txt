Mass immigration to Britain is due to a “wealthy metropolitan elite" who want cheap labour and services, Conservative Home Office Minister James Brokenshire said, in a direct clash with his Liberal Democrat coalition partners.
“For too long, the benefits of immigration went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour; or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services — but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country," Mr Brokenshire said in a speech to the Demos research institute in London today.
His comments pit him against Business Secretary Vince Cable, who will make a speech at Mansion House this evening in favour of immigration.
Mr Cable and Home Secretary Theresa May, have frequently clashed on how the UK should tackle migration, with the Conservatives seeking to bring net migration to below 100,000 a year by 2015.
