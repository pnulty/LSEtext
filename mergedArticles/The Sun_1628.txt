ABUSE of immigration rules by bogus students is getting worse, according to evidence passed to the Home Secretary.
Documents reveal routine visa rule breaches by institutions acting "negligently or deliberately".
At one private college, 397 foreign students not allowed to work were found to be earning more than £20,000 a year. Students supposedly in Manchester were actually living in Northern Ireland.
And another institution recruited 70 students — but did not have any teachers for the course. In a letter to the Cabinet, Home Secretary Theresa May said: "Evidence uncovered by Visas and Immigration staff shows that abuse of the system has evolved, not disappeared." Sources last night claimed to The Sun that the Lib Dems were blocking proposals to clamp down on the abuse.
These include penalties for universities who partner with private colleges found to be breaching rules.
Another proposes only allowing students to bring dependants if their course lasts for two years or more.
