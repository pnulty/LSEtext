DAVID Cameron has unveiled his seven musts for a reformed EU.
The Prime Minister plans to renegotiate the UK's membership to include tougher laws to stop immigrants cashing in on "free benefits".
He has also proposed new powers for Parliament to veto unpopular foreign legislation.
And meddling judges in Strasbourg will be banned from interfering with the UK justice system.
The Tory leader set out his changes while warning that the British public's support for the EU was "wafer thin".
Mr Cameron said: "I completely understand and share people's concerns that Britain is being sucked into a United States of Europe.
"That may be what some others want, but it is not for us."
