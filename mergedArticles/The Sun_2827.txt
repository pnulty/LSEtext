FURIOUS Tories slammed David Cameron last night as his election pledge to slash immigration to "tens of thousands" lay in tatters.
Backbench MP Nigel Mills branded last year's huge surge a "disaster" adding: "It shows how out of control immigration is and how we are not going to get anywhere near the target."
Another Tory said the PM had to live up to his immigration pledge or lose more votes to UKIP.
But Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable claimed the figures were "good news" for UK workers.
He added: "Fewer people are choosing to emigrate as they see more job opportunities at home."
