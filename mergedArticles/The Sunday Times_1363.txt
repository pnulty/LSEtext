THE home secretary, Theresa May, has criticised her Liberal Democrat cabinet colleague Vince Cable over his celebration of rising immigration from the European Union.
Last week, Cable welcomed new figures showing a net increase in migration of 30% to Britain from the EU as "good news".
The business secretary claimed the rise was "further proof that any quota on migration, such as the one Conservatives are pushing to get net migration down to tens of thousands, is unworkable".
However, May dismissed Cable's position in a newspaper article today.
"I do not agree. We still have work to do to restore control of our immigration system," she wrote in the Mail on Sunday.
However, she admitted there was nothing the government could do to stop European citizens coming to work in the UK without significant reform of the EU.
"As long as there is such an enormous disparity between EU member states in terms of income per head, there will be an overwhelming incentive for people to move from poorer nations to richer states," she wrote.
The disagreement between Cable and May comes as the coalition parties air their differences towards the EU ahead of the European elections in May. Nick Clegg and the UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, have agreed to debate whether the UK should remain in the EU. "He is the leader of the party of 'out'. I am the leader of the party of 'in'," Clegg said.
