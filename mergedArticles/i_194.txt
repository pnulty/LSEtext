Teenager Yashika Bageerathi is said to be "very frightened" after landing in Mauritius following her deportation from the UK.
Several last-minute efforts were made on Wednesday to prevent the A-level student being sent to her native country, including an emergency court order and an appeal from Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee.
The 19-year-old is looking for somewhere safe to stay, following a police interview at the airport, said Lynne Dawes, head teacher at Oasis Academy Hadley, in north London. Several politicians and her school had campaigned to try to prevent her deportation, gathering more than 175,000 signatures on the website Change.org.
Ms Bageerathi came to the UK with her mother, sister and brother in 2011 to escape a relative who she said was physically abusive, and claimed asylum last summer.
