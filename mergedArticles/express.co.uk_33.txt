THE City of Leeds secondary school has just become the first school in the country to teach all of its pupils English as if it were a foreign language.
The headteacher has said that even the 15 per cent of pupils who were born in Britain need the classes because their language skills are so poor.
The problem is even more acute for the rest of the children who come from 55 different countries and between them speak 50 different languages.
For all its perceived failings the school – which last year posted the poorest GCSE results in Leeds – has been left in an impossible position by rampant immigration from eastern Europe and the rest of the world.
Filling our classrooms with pupils who cannot communicate with the staff and children around them is desperately unfair. The children who do speak English fluently are clearly going to find their time in education far less beneficial if they are forced to sit through lessons tailored for others whose communication skills are years behind. As Ukip leader Nigel Farage says: “It is just increasing division in our society.”
The ability to speak English well enough to keep up with the class has to be considered a basic requirement for a place in a British school. After all, there is only so much that the schools can achieve when many immigrant families still refuse to speak English at home.

Britain has no influence
IT is not a surprise that the EU has been paying little attention to British objections for almost 20 years. Research has revealed that since 1996 Britain has voted against 55 proposals put to the EU Council of Ministers and been outvoted every single time.
There is an argument from the Left that we are better off in the EU because it means we can have a say in the future direction of the union.
Today’s findings make it obvious that their argument is absurd. We clearly have very little influence in how the EU is run and as it has expanded that influence has dwindled further.
The only way for us to claw back power is to leave the EU for good and the sooner we can do that the better.

He's still causing chaos
BOB CROW will be much missed by his friends, family and the thousands of supporters who lined the roads yesterday as his funeral procession passed.
Bob was disliked in life for the chaos he brought to transport networks so there can be no doubt he would have greatly enjoyed the traffic jam that built up behind him as he made his final journey through East London.
