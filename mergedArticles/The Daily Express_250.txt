BRITAIN'S economy is set to expand more than hoped this year although political meddling may undermine it, business leaders said.
UK gross domestic product should grow 3 per cent in 2014, up from an earlier forecast of 2.6 per cent, the CBI predicted. In 2015 the economy should expand 2.7 per cent rather than 2.5 per cent. The economy grew 0.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 and quarter–onquarter GDP growth of 0.7 per cent is expected for the rest of 2014 and next year.
The CBI also believes interest rates will rise earlier than it first thought, by 0.25 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. But it said political uncertainty and whims could stymie the revival.
The CBI urged the Government to get rid of the budget deficit, criticised its immigration targets and said it should take a longer–term strategic approach to big infrastructure projects.
CBI director–general John Cridland said: "The UK now has more stable economic foundations and political risks must not jeopardise this."
He added property values were set to rise 8.2 per cent this year and 5.1 per cent next. "We have to remain alert to risks posed by unsustainable house price inflation," he said.
