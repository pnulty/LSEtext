VOTERS in one of London's most hotly contested battleground boroughs today said local issues, not spats between the national leaders, were the key.
Since 2010, the north-east London borough of Redbridge has mirrored the national government with a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition at the helm. But it is a major target for Labour, which hopes to take the council for the first time.
A lack of school places was the biggest issue the Standard heard about outside polling stations and in local shops and cafés today.
Voters said housing, immigration, fears over hospital cuts, fly-tipping and street prostitution were also issues that mattered. Among the early birds voting at the Methodist church hall near Redbridge Tube at 7am was City stockbroker Yusuf Mohmmed, 35. He said: "As a father of three, the big issues for me are grammar schools and swimming pools."
Nearby, café owner Mohammed Firuz, 44, a father-of-four, said: "For me it's all about the local issues, I'm not really interested in Europe.
"You can't get a school place here and my hope for whichever party wins is they can do something to ease the crisis for parent."
The council currently has 29 Conservative wards, 21 Labour, seven Lib-Dems and six independents.
Several political big-hitters made flying visits to Redbridge ahead of today's vote, including Labour leader Ed Miliband and London Mayor Boris Johnson.
