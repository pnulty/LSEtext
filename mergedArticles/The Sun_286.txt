SEIZURES of smuggled drugs and cigs at Britain's borders are plummeting, sparking fears of a customs crisis.
Officers found 73 per cent less heroin and half the amount of cannabis last year compared to 2012. Confiscated ecstasy was down 41 per cent and cocaine fell by 18 per cent.
And almost 80million fewer illegal cigarettes were seized in the last three months of 2013, compared to the same period a year earlier.
The shock stats come after the borders watchdog found officers at Stansted Airport were taken off customs checks and moved to passport control instead. Labour shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: "The Home Secretary is failing to stop the flow of drugs and illegal cigarettes into the UK. This is more evidence this Government can't be trusted to protect our borders."
But immigration minister James Brokenshire insisted there was no "let up" in border activity, adding: "While the volume of drugs seized is down, the number of individual seizures has risen significantly."
