DAVID Cameron looked pretty relaxed in the House of Commons today.
And no wonder. Just before he walked into Prime Minister's Questions he was told the good news that more people in Britain have jobs right now than ever before.
As a result Britain's economy has grown even faster than it was expected to.
It's the surest sign yet that the country is finally coming out of the gloom that was first cast by the recession back in 2008.
But Mr Cameron should not get too cocky.
There are millions of us who will still struggle financially for years.
And there are dozens of other issues to resolve, immigration from Europe being a key example.
But the news about jobs is welcome relief as the sunshine finally returns to Britain.
