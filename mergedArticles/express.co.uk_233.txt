NO ONE can fault the Queen for her workload. At 88, an age when most of her subjects have been retired for years, she still carries out scores of engagements with unflappable grace.
But she can’t go on for ever and last week she finally gave in and agreed not to tackle steep stairs at Westminster Abbey, instead allowing the Prince of Wales to stand in at a ceremony. 
Why doesn’t the Queen hand over completely to her son, you might well ask. She has put in a lifetime of service and richly deserves a rest. Monarchs in other countries have no problem with abdication but in Britain the word has a bad connotation. It was Edward VIII’s selfish decision to pursue his love life that led to Elizabeth’s father becoming king, a role he was unprepared for and which probably contributed to his early death. 
The Queen long ago resolved that it would be for life but I’m sure she would heartily welcome some respite from endless meetings and greetings. It might seem like a dream job but just imagine seeing only fawning faces day after day, everyone on their best behaviour – apart from her husband – and “Your Majestying”. It’s so unreal. Why not let Charles gradually take on more duties? And yet I doubt if the Queen will ever be ready to hand over. Hard luck, son.

Trip Advisor reviews are good entertainment, but no more
Some contributors to Trip Adviser have been accused of blackmailing hotels and restaurants, threatening to submit nasty comments if they don’t get freebies or special deals. It’s such an obvious flaw in the website that I suspect such abuses have been going on for years.
I do occasionally look on Trip Adviser and similar sites but there’s little point because the comments are usually so diverse that it’s impossible to draw a conclusion. A place can be the most wonderful experience ever and the weekend from hell. The same staff are smart and attentive and sloppy and rude. The food is heavenly and inedible. 
There’s also the professional complainer who goes out of his way to find fault and gets a kick out of seeing his moans in print. At the other extreme are the customers who just want to be nice and will praise purgatory. The truth is these guides are no more than entertainment.

The Beeb, Claudia Winkleman and the nasty spread of Positive discrimination 
The BBC was determined to give Bruce Forsyth’s job to a woman and it looks as if a woman will be picked to front the new mega version of Civilisation, not necessarily because she’s the top candidate. 
Positive discrimination is one of the nastiest types of political correctness. It leads to resentment and injustice and it has become part of our culture. Would anyone want a job on that basis? Don’t kid yourself. Thousands would – it’s dog eat dog, cat eat cat.
Equal pay for “equal work” is another form of positive discrimination. Unions are pushing it to the limit and although some women’s pay has increased it has also caused wages in general to stagnate and led to thousands of job losses because organisations can’t find the extra money. 
The unions haven’t learned to be careful what they wish for. They either don’t see the danger of unintended consequences or don’t care.

Slowing down the Countdown
Drivers are fuming over plans for traffic lights to stay on red longer to give pedestrians more time to cross the road. Well I’m no slouch but I find many crossings a rush. It’s stressful when the lights change before you make it to the other side with drivers snarling at you through their windscreens. 
The best crossings are those with countdown clocks. You know exactly how long you’ve got and whether you can make it but of course some chancers abuse them by walking with just a second or two left. 
I fondly recall a holiday in New England where drivers stuck rigidly to 10 or 15mph limits on high streets and stopped to let pedestrians go even when there were no crossings. If only we had such New World courtesy here. 
Some hope.

Lazy Brits need to face the truth - Eastern Europeans are more prepared to work
Immigration has reached insane levels and the result is Britain’s population will soon be completely changed because minorities are having more children than the natives. We forget, however, that all this has happened several times before, admittedly long ago. 
I wonder if it would make a vast difference to unemployment if immigration were totally stopped. I’m not convinced that jobless Britons would race to take up vacancies. There are generations who have never worked and been, if not happy, at least content to idle away their lives. The welfare state has made that happen. 
Eastern Europeans mostly come here prepared to work. Some will inevitably join the benefits brigade but thousands of them are doing jobs that Britons don’t want and doing them well. Just ask employers whom they prefer. We need to face the truth.

Gary Barlow performing a sell-out gig despite his recent tax evasion scandal [GETTY]
Gary Barlow dodges tax - but remains in popularity polls
Take That’s Gary Barlow is apparently more popular than ever despite being caught out as a big-time tax dodger. He’s not alone. Other stars such as Jimmy Carr aren’t exactly shunned and huge companies such as Amazon, Google and Starbucks are still reporting enormous profits while paying peanuts in tax. 
You’d think the people trapped in pay-as-you-earn would boycott the fiddlers but they just wish they could join them. Everyone hates paying taxes. Someone has to otherwise we would be bankrupt like Greece but in the war on tax all is fair. 
Not that I subscribe to that irresponsible philosophy – HMRC please note.
