NIGEL Farage is the Weeble of British politics.
Just like the classic roly-poly toy — which wobbled but never fell down — he stays on his feet no matter what furore hits his Ukip party.
Just over a week from the European elections, Farage has claimed older Brits "feel uncomfortable" about homosexuality and that many of us are "disconcerted" by gay marriage.
Any outrage is unlikely to derail the Ukip train. A weekend poll put them just nine points behind the Tories. And David Cameron looks unable to do a single thing about it.
Our readers tell us that immigration is their number one priority at the moment. Yet the PM has defended ongoing unrestricted movement within the EU. Why is it that we listen, yet he won't?
Experts believe more than 30,000 Romanians and Bulgarians have poured in looking for work since restrictions were lifted in January.
It's vital people can come and help Britain build back to prosperity. But when there is no limit, in a time where many of our own kids struggle for jobs, concerns are understandable.
Until Cameron shows willingness to have Britain not Brussels control this key issue, he is going to struggle.
He needs to find something soon, though, if Farage the Weeble is to be knocked over.
