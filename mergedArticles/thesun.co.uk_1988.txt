A QUARTER of all Eastern Europeans working in Britain only contribute a £1 a WEEK to the state, new figures reveal.
A total of 150,000 who earn the minimum wage receive almost as much in hand outs as they pay in tax and national insurance.
And some who don't work full time give nothing to the government in exchange for their handouts - along with many of their dependents - the pressure group Migration Watch has calculated.
Campaigners last night said the fresh sums undermined the pro-freedom of movement argument that EU newcomers are a boost to Britain.
Employed migrants with a partner receive a net benefit of £88 a week, while those with two children receive a net benefit of £295 a week.
A couple where both partners work on minimum wage would pay in a total £28 net, however, if they have two children they could receive a net benefit of £380 a week.
At the same time, half of all 600,000 working East European migrants are earning no more than £300 a week.
Migration Watch chairman Sir Andrew Green said: "This analysis shows quite simply that the taxpayer is subsidising their wages; no wonder then that so many people find the UK such an attractive destination."
Sir Andrew added: "We constantly hear that immigrants work hard and pay their taxes.
"There is no doubt that many of these people do work hard but it is a fact that those on the minimum wage pay virtually no direct taxes and, if in a couple, they can receive significant sums in tax credits and other benefits."
Numbers from the poorer EU countries are expected to have accelerated in the last four months after a ban on Romanians and Bulgarians was lifted on January 1.
