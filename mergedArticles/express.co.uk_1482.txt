DAVID Cameron defended his employment of a foreign-born nanny yesterday amid growing concern that the Government will miss its promised target for cutting immigration.
The Prime Minister faced questions about the recent increase in official immigration figures during a Bethlehem news conference on the final day of his visit to the Middle East.
An Ipsos Mori poll released yesterday suggested the Coalition is losing public trust on border controls.
Mr Cameron insisted that the overall figure had been cut by nearly a fifth since the Government came to power in 2010 and he dismissed criticism of his own employment of Nepalese-born nanny Gita Lima.
He said: “I have an excellent woman, Gita Lima, who looks after my children who is a British citizen. She came originally from Nepal. She has carried out exams and become a British citizen and she does a fantastic job.
“She certainly fits the description of someone who works hard and wants to get on."
Earlier, in Jerusalem, Mr Cameron held talks with Tony Blair – but insisted their relationship was about diplomacy rather than friendship.
He is known to regularly consult the former Labour Prime Minister – now the West’s Middle East peace envoy – particularly drawing on his experience of international affairs.
After the meeting, Mr Cameron was at pains to play down his closeness to Mr Blair.
He said: “I obviously listen to Tony Blair’s advice, as I listen to many people’s advice."
Asked if they had a friendly relationship, he added: “I wouldn’t say it is about friendship. We were very vigorous opponents...but we both want a two-state solution and he has got a contribution to help bring that about."
Mr Blair said that Britain could play a significant role in helping to further the peace process.
