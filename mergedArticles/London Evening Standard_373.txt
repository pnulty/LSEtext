THIS paper's investigation of some of Ukip's candidates for London local councils in this month's elections should give pause to those who downplay criticism of the party's alleged racism. A string of Ukip London candidates have made questionable comments and interventions that downplay the extremism of the BNP and EDL. For example, Brent candidate Heino Vockrodt, ironically a German immigrant, described members of the EDL as "honest normal peopleâ€¦ they get an unfair press". The revelations follow a string of recent embarrassments for the party over some candidates' racist and just plain eccentric statements on Twitter and elsewhere, as well as previous rows over sexist remarks by Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom.
All parties have local activists and politicians who embarrass themselves on social media. But the extent of the gaffes by Ukip suggests a particularly lackadaisical approach to candidate selection. Ukip leader Nigel Farage's response to such charges has been, improbably, that the party has been infiltrated, and that it can't be expected to have the levels of organisation of the major parties. In other words, whatever its pretensions, Ukip is not a serious party, albeit one with a charismatic leader. Londoners are perfectly entitled to cast protest votes. But they should be under no illusions as to some of the characters they will be backing should they vote Ukip. At best, Ukip is not capable of exercising meaningful public office; at worst, these are not candidates worthy of public life.
