Britain will need looser immigration rules over the next decade to help plug a yawning employment gap in engineering and other high-skill sectors, Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Treasury chief secretary, has said.
Mr Alexander has written to Theresa May, home secretary, saying that instead of clamping down on immigration, Britain needs to be even more welcoming to engineers, scientists and technology workers.
He cited a Royal Academy of Engineering report, which said Britain would need more than 800,000 such workers between 2012 and 2030, but that UK universities were projected to turn out only 32,000 engineering graduates a year.
The Home Office's cap on highly skilled migrants - so-called "tier 2" - is 20,700 a year, but James Brokenshire, immigration minister, said on Thursday that applications were running at only half that level.
Mr Alexander says the operation of the scheme - which sets a minimum salary threshold - deters PhD students from coming to Britain and others entering the sector.
He told Mrs May: "We should listen to our business leaders when they tell us that this route does not work for all."
