Immigrants have cost the taxpayer more than £22million a day since the mid–1990s, a report claims.
MigrationWatch UK, which campaigns against mass immigration, added that in 2011 the costs were equivalent to £3,000 for each of the eight million foreign–born people living in Britain.
It compiled the figures in response to a study published by University College London last year which claimed immigrants made a "substantial" contribution to public finances. The pressure group's new report said UCL's conclusions were "simply wrong".
Sir Andrew Green, its chairman, said: "Our report finally disposes of the immigration lobby's oft–repeated claims that immigration reduces our tax burden."
