LABOUR MP Diane Abbott has denied the rising popularity of Ukip represents a protest against the established Westminster parties.
Instead, she said Ukip's strong standing is due to the party's willingness to 'sink to the gutter' to seek anti-immigrant votes.
Speaking at an anti-racism rally in Trafalgar Square, Ms Abbott said: "The objective is to say to politicians in all parties that we're tired of this anti-immigrant political narrative."
Abbott also said the Budget was a bid to woo disillusioned older Conservative voters.
