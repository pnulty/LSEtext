A backstage look at how the Telegraph put #PhoneFarage together
This afternoon the Telegraph hosted Phone Farage - a chance for readers and viewers to question the Ukip leader on a range of policy issues.
Fresh from his performance at this week's debate with the Deputy Prime Minister, he was asked about issues ranging from the economy and immigration to gay marriage and expenses.
The responses were frequently unexpected - a question on Mr Farage's attendance in the European Parliament, for example, prompted a frank discussion of his health.
"There is a reason why in this Parliament my attendance and voting record was down, you may not have noticed it, but I actually had a plane crash in 2010, which took me out for a few months," he said.
Other colourful revelations included his having sent a book to a prisoner - which the inmate was not allowed to read.
Watch this behind-the-scenes look at the day's event.
