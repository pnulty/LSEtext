News | The Opinion Matrix COMMENT FROM HOME & ABROAD FOREIGN LABOUR
The Daily Telegraph Here's a prediction. Ministers will spend the coming days fending off questions about their domestic employees - nannies, cleaners, builders, plumbers - specifi-cally about their nationality. David Cameron's spokesman stonewalled questions about his foreign nanny yesterday, and Nick Clegg admitted to employing a Belgian. Presumably there will be others, since the home roles most commonly contracted out are dominated, in London at least, by foreign workers. Imagine the sport if the questioning extends from nationality to immigration status. (Benedict Brogan)
