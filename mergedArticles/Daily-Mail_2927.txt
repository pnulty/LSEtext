FIGHTS erupted outside French town halls last night following dramatic gains in local elections by the National Front.
Exit polls suggested that the far-Right anti-immigration and anti-Europe party had roundly beaten the governing Socialists in a number of key constituencies.
Riot police were also out in force as anti-fascist protesters threatened Front National (FN) candidates with violence.
'Demonstrators are trying to get at the Front representatives and starting fights,' said a police spokesman in Frejus, a picturesque town popular with British tourists.
Frejus and nearby Beziers are now expected to have FN mayors sworn in along with around five other towns following a nationwide drubbing for President Francois Hollande's Socialists.
It means further humiliation for Mr Hollande, whose disastrous tax and spending policies have led to economic stagnation.
Disgruntled voters have been turning to the FN, a party regularly accused of being racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-Muslim.
As polls closed, the FN said it was on track to claim 1,200 municipal council seats.
David Rachline, 26, a former head of the party's youth movement who is expected to become Frejus's FN mayor, said: 'The political establishment has failed the people - it has ruined the town and filled its pockets. You can't talk about a protest vote any more - the Front's scores show that people are backing its ideas.'
