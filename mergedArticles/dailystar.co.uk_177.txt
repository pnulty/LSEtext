ROCK legend Roger Daltrey had doubts about his new album – because he didn’t think he was a good enough singer.
The Who icon returns to the charts with Going Back Home featuring Wilko Johnson, 66.
It’s an album of Wilko and Dr Feelgood covers. Roger, 69, told me: “I wondered if I’d be able to pull it off.
"I’m terribly insecure when I sing, and I’d never tried this style of song before.
“The key was going back to songs I loved as a teenager and thinking: ‘How would have I sung this in 1963?’
“I grabbed it by the balls and it worked.”
Roger added: “My voice is better than it’s ever been, so there are a lot of different albums I still want to make.”
