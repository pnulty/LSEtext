NICK Clegg was accused of misleading the public over the impact of immigration after ridiculing a report which warned that new arrivals could fill a city the size of Manchester every five years.
During the TV debate, Ukip leader Nigel Farage cited a report from the respected pressure group Migration Watch suggesting that net EU immigration is likely to exceed 100,000 a year for the next five years.
But Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg described the report as 'dangerous scaremongering'. He added: 'The population of Greater Manchester is 2.7million. It is a nonsense, this idea that 2.7million people are going to come here.'
Migration Watch yesterday pointed out its report had correctly stated the population of Manchester as just over 500,000.
A spokesman added: 'It seems that Mr Clegg deliberately chose to conflate the city of Manchester with the larger urban area the city is a part of.'
