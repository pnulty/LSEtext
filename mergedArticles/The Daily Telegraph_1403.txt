PLANS to bring down net migration into the "tens of thousands" are still on target, the Conservative party chairman claimed yesterday, despite figures showing that it has reached 200,000.
Grant Shapps said bringing net migration to below 100,000 a year remained the Government's plan, but admitted that to reach the target, the numbers of people arriving in Britain from Europe would need to fall dramatically over the next year.
The Office for National Statistics reported a net flow of 212,000 migrants to Britain for the 12 months to the end of September, compared with 154,000 the previous year.
Mr Shapps said the rise could be explained by increased movement from the "older countries in the EU", including Italy, Spain and Portugal.
But the data show the surge was partly driven by a 166 per cent increase in the number of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens coming to Britain, from 9,000 to 24,000 year on year.
Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Shapps said: "That's still our goal, to bring the numbers down. I very much hope [the numbers will come down]."
Critics have said that the Government stands no chance of bringing net migration down to the tens of thousands. Mark Hilton, head of immigration policy at London First, the business membership organisation, said it was "game over" for the Government's migration target. "What we need to be wary of is the Government trying to control future figures by further limiting the only number it has power over – non–EU migrants," he said.
Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, also speaking on the Andrew Marr Show said that the figures showing a large increase in net migration proved that EU membership was incompatible with control over borders.
