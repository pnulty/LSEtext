Rapper WILEY has lashed out at immigration officials in Canada after he was deported from the country before a show in Toronto on Wednesday .
The Heatwave hitmaker, 35, was en route to the city to perform at The Hoxton venue when he was stopped by Canadian border authorities amid concerns of a criminal history in the U.S.
Wiley told customs officials he had never run into legal trouble in America, but it wasn't enough to get him into the country.
In a series of posts on Twitter.com on Wednesday night, he wrote, "Immigration have got me and are sending me back to london .....Sad story. TELLING ME I HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD IN AMERICA .......WHAT ARE THE SAYING ...I HAVE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED IN AMERICA B4 . I am not even angry this is the 3rd time in life i have been denied from a place ...for nothing cos i have never been to jail in my life ."
But Wiley's troubles only got worse after the London-based star learned he was being put on a plane to Glasgow, Scotland instead of one to the capital.
He later tweeted, "OMG IMMIGRATION ARE SENDING ME BACK TO SCOTLAND WTF ......CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS... GLASGOW......WTF ...HE SAID I CAN CAN FIND MY WAY TO ENGLAND FROM GLASGOW....WHAT A P**CK...
"Anyway en route to scotland F**KIN ELL .......trek ".
The deportation is the latest drama in Wiley's life - he recently announced he was scrapping his new album, Snakes And Ladders, because he was unimpressed by his own work.
