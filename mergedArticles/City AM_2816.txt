THE UK'S tightening immigration controls are keeping a lid on Britain's qualified workforce, holding it at too low a level to cope with long-term demand, according to a major recruitment firm.
Analysis by Randstad claims there are a third fewer skilled migrants arriving to the UK than before 2007, and 15 per cent more workers are leaving the country.
"The UK has shut the door on the skill-sets that the financial and professional services sectors need and a key part of people's professional fulfilment - the opportunity to work abroad is starting to become a thing of the past," said Tara Ricks of Randstad Financial and Professional The group says there says there is currently a major shortfall of staff, based on the expected requirement in the next four decades. Social workers, engineers, accountants and lawyers are some of the major sectors that are understaffed.
According to Randstad, the accountancy and legal professions are particularly badly affected, with workforces 25 and 27 per cent smaller respectively than they should be to meet demand in 2050.
