AN illegal immigrant raped a 14-year-old girl with learning difficulties - a month after he should have been kicked out of the country.
Hamidullah Hamidi, 19, lay in wait for the "extremely vulnerable" girl, who has the mental age of a seven-year-old, outside a shop in Bristol last December.
He has now been jailed for six years at Bristol Crown Court after admitting rape.
Hamidi, who fled his native Afghanistan as a child, had been due to return when he reached 18, but was still in the country four weeks later when the attack took place.
Giles Nelson, prosecuting, said Hamidi had offered the girl money to go with him, but when he then grabbed her and pulled her along "she was trying to stop him but couldn't".
He dragged her to his house where he locked her inside before raping her, Mr Nelson added.
