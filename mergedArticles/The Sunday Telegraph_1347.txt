DISAPPOINTING DAVID
Attention focused on the visit of Angela Merkel, who became the first German Chancellor to address both houses of Parliament since 1970. Ms Merkel said that she can work with the UK to reform the European Union but it will not be "a piece of cake" and hopes of major changes will end in "disappointment". The release of new immigration statistics showed that net migration increased to 212,000 in the year to September 2013. Before the last election, David Cameron had promised to reduce net migration to "tens of thousands".
SCOTTISH LIFELINE
Standard Life became the first major business to warn that it could leave an independent Scotland. Its annual report outlined contingency plans to relocate operations to England, "in order to ensure continuity and to protect the interests of our stakeholders". Meanwhile, the credit-rating agency Standard & Poor's said that there was "no fundamental reason" that Scotland could not float its own currency.
WET AND WILD
The Met Office confirmed that this winter has been the wettest since at least 1766, and the fifth-warmest since 1910. Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, warned that flooding would continue for several more months, and said that dredging would be "ready to start" from the end of March, depending on the pace at which flood water recedes. A family of wild beavers was sighted in the English countryside, in what was believed to be the first sighting in up to 500 years. Meanwhile, at Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron said: "I believe man-made climate change is one of the greatest threats this country and the world faces."
