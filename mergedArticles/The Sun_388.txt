AIRLINE passengers were facing long queues at UK airports last night after a computer glitch hit immigration desks.
Extra staff were being brought in to try to cut passport control queues.
The delays began growing when UK Border Force computers suffered IT problems yesterday afternoon.
Heathrow, Gatwick and Birmingham airports all reported queues. Delays were mainly affecting inbound passengers, with non-EU citizens worst hit.
A Government spokesman apologised, saying: "We are working to rectify this. Our priority remains security of the border."
