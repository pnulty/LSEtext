The Home Office will not intervene in the case of a Mauritian student facing deportation from the UK, the House of Commons has been told.
James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, told MPs that 19-year-old Yashika Bageerathi's case had been through the proper legal process and the Home Office's decision that she did not need protection from violence or persecution in her homeland had been upheld. Brokenshire said that "given the extent and level of judicial and other scrutiny", the home secretary, Theresa May, had decided not to intervene. Bageerathi is uncertain about her future after the Home Office deferred her removal from the country, which would mean her separation from her family shortly before she completes her A-levels. She had expected to be returned to Mauritius yesterday, but late on Saturday she was told by the Home Office that she would not be on board the flight from Heathrow.
No reason was given for the cancellation, though there were suggestions that Air Mauritius had refused to fly her.
Brokenshire told the Commons: "We consider every claim for asylum on its merits and . . . this applicant was not considered to be in need of protection."
A petition by students calling on Brokenshire and May to stop the deportation has had more than 170,000 signatures on Change.org. The shadow immigration minister, David Hanson, said he would ask the Home Office to review the decision. PA
