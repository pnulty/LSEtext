RECORD VIEW
THE draconian immigration rules stopping married Britons bringing their spouse to live in the UK are a desperate piece of legislation.
They are snarling up families in red tape and separating couples needlessly.
Even when couples are well financed, if they can't prove to the bureaucrats that their money is UK-earned they can't get permission to bring their families into the country.
It has left Philip Malloy separated for months from his Japanese-born wife and son.
There is no need for such a blunt instrument as an Â£18,600 earnings minimum. Common sense and sensitivity can be deployed as well.
