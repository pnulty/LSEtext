TONIGHT'S PICKS
Turn on
Weekend Escapes With Warwick Davis ITV, 8pm
IT'S that time of year when we're all desperate for a mini break to tide us over until our big summer holiday. Luckily, Warwick is on hand to showcase the best getaways Blighty has to offer.
The Trip To Italy BBC2, 10pm
VENTURING a little further afield than Warwick are Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan who, in this week's second episode, continue to compare themselves to classic poets Byron and Shelley. Well, modesty was never this pair's strong point, was it?
Love/hate
Britpop At The BBC BBC4, 10pm
IF you miss the halcyon days of Blur v Oasis, you'll love this musical look-back. However, if you think of that era more as s***pop than Britpop, this indie-fest won't be up your street.
Turn off
Gypsies On Benefits & Proud, C5, 9pm
WE want to relax at the start of the weekend, not feel our blood boil as a result of watching this doc about immigrants taking advantage of our benefits system.
