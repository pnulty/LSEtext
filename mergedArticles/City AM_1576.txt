UKIP leader Nigel Farage triumphed in yesterday's tussle with deputy prime minister Nick Clegg over the UK's membership of the European Union, according to a YouGov poll.
The hour-long TV and radio debate focused on the impact of the EU on areas as widespread as immigration, jobs, the European arrest warrant and the crisis in Ukraine.
Polling firm YouGov indicated that Farage had won the audience, with 57 per cent responding that he was the best performer, against Clegg's 36 per cent.
Clegg, who was previously a member of the European parliament like Farage, spoke in favour of the UK's member-ship of the single market.
"We are better off in Europe: richer, stronger, safer - and that's why I will fight to keep us in, for the sake of jobs, for the sake of our clout in the world."
Farage closed the debate, saying that he wanted a controlled migration policy and for the UK to govern itself. Speaking on business opinions of the EU issue, James Sproule, head of policy for the Institute of Directors (IoD), said: "What's needed most of all in this debate is a laser-like focus on reforms aimed at making the EU more competitive, more business-friendly and more relevant."
He added: "Among IoD members there is little appetite for a British exit from the EU, but equally there is little appetite for more of the same. Businesses want renegotiation and reform."
