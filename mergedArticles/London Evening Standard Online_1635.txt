John Jencks’s Cornwall-set Brit drama is about a sexually scrambled Anglican vicar, who struggles to accept the death of her teenage daughter
An interesting premise (sexually scrambled Anglican vicar struggles to accept the death of her teenage daughter) is let down by weak direction and dialogue in this Cornwall-set Brit drama. Catherine McCormack does her best to make us believe in Rebecca, stiff-mouthed with misery until a self-harming, immigrant youngster (Marina Stoimenova, limited) catches her eye.
That we never discover why or how the daughter died is a nice touch but the happy-shiny Bulgarian gypsies who offer a musical lifeline for Rebecca’s other child, Eloise (Dakota Blue Richards, who made her debut in The Golden Compass) sum up everything that’s wrong with John Jencks’s confused seaside tale.
Star Rating: 2.00 stars
