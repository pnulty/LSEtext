A REPORT which cleared the BBC of pro-EU bias will come under fire today for being "not worth the paper it was written on".
An "impartiality review" was undermined by "incestuous" links between its authors, the BBC and the EU and contained fundamental mistakes, the probe from think-tank Civitas will say today.
Its report by media monitors Newswatch covers the Â£175,000 review commissioned in August 2012 by the BBC Trust from former ITV chief Stuart Prebble.
Newswatch director David Keighley, an ex-BBC reporter and publicity officer, and Andrew Jubb said it was "not worth the paper it was written on".
They added: "The BBC Trustees - the ultimate regulatory body of the Corporation - have not exercised proper scrutiny in reaching their conclusion that the EU output was properly balanced.
"This raises serious questions about their own impartiality and competence."
The report said research methods did "not meet basic standards of academic inquiry" with academics making "biased assumptions" and errors in sampling.
A decision by the review to focus only on the Lisbon Treaty in 2007 and EU budget talks in 2012 meant 30 per cent of Europerelated material broadcast at the time was ignored, it said.
The research covered only a month-long period in 2007 and again in 2012, and 272 hours of output compared to over 6,000 hours monitored by Newswatch.
The BBC Trust said it stood by the review.
The review was not into the impartiality of BBC EU coverage but opinions expressed on the EU, religion and immigration, it said. OPINION: PAGE 12
