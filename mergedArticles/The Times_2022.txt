Boris Johnson's status as the favourite to succeed David Cameron and his tenure as London mayor have not stopped him suffering from a bad bout of sibling jealousy, he has revealed.
Mr Johnson has admitted that while he was proud of the achievements of his younger brother Jo, who was given a senior post in No 10 last year, he conceded that he could not help but feel envious of his rise.
"I rejoice in his success," the mayor said. "A little piece of me dies, but otherwise I rejoice in his success." Jo Johnson, who was elected to the safe London seat of Orpington at the last election, was made the head of Mr Cameron's policy unit after emerging as one of the brightest MPs of the new intake. Some in Westminster now see him as a future prime minister.
He is seven years younger than the London mayor, who is painfully aware that he would not be the first of the Johnson clan to enter Downing Street should he become prime minister.
Mr Johnson made the remarks in an interview with Total Politics magazine, in which he again batted away questions about whether he would stand for parliament at the next election.
In remarks that will alienate many Tories, he also reiterated his support for an amnesty for illegal immigrants in the country for a decade or more.
"The alternative is to continue in a situation in which half a million people or maybe 750,000 people [live] in Britain, most of them in London, not registered, with no papers, contributing to the London economy, making money, but not paying tax," he said. "I would limit [the amnesty] at those who arrived a decade ago. I wouldn't make it more recent than that."
