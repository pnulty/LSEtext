ANOTHER day, another storm for Nigel Farage.
The Ukip leader is lurching from one PR disaster to the next.
Now he has been accused of using the N-word to describe black voters.
It comes after his so-called car crash interview on a radio station four days ago.
The scandals could cost his party dear in Thursday's elections.
Mr Farage's straight-talking approach on jobs and barmy human rights laws have struck a chord with voters.
Most agree that Britain must make a stand against the tidal wave of immigration.
But he must stamp out the racist element from his party quickly if he wants to be taken seriously.
