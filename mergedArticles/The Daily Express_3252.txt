AN extra 167,000 EU migrants have landed jobs in Britain over the past year, official figures revealed yesterday.
They showed the influx continuing to soar with an increase of 74,000 in the number of East Europeans working in the UK over the past three months.
The figures led one senior minister to admit the Government was on course to miss its target of cutting annual net migration to the tens of thousands by next May.
Offensive But the statistics also showed that the numbers of Bulgarians and Romanians working in Britain had fallen over the past three months.
Data from the Office for National Statistics showed the number of migrants from the two countries fell by 4,000 to 140,000 between January and March compared with the previous three months.
The unexpected drop, following the lifting of visa restrictions, sparked an angry row last night.
Tory minister Anna Soubry conceded that the Government was unlikely to reach the net migration target set by David Cameron.
"At the moment we don't seem to be on course," she said. But she also accused the UK Independence Party of "wild and offensive" claims that relaxing border controls would lead to a huge surge in the number of Romanians and Bulgarians coming to Britain.
Miss Soubry, a defence minister, told the BBC: "These figures just show that Ukip preys on people's fears, it preys on prejudices in many people.
"And they make these wild, actually rather offensive claims, and hey, what happens? It was all a load of nonsense."
Ukip hit back by pointing out that the figures showed a total increase in foreigners working in Britain of 292,000 over the past year. Leader Nigel Farage said: "Far from controlling immigration, this Government has shown it has absolutely no control over Britain's borders and no intention of putting the British people first.
"Having promised the British electorate that they would bring net immigration down to the tens of thousands, the Government has instead overseen another massive increase in those coming to Britain."
Pressure group Migration Watch UK was sticking to a prediction that there would be a significant surge in immigration over the next five years. Chairman Sir Andrew Green said: "Quarterly statistics fluctuate but these figures show an increase of 28,000 Romanians and Bulgarians in employment compared to the same period last year."
He added: "This is consistent with our estimate of a 50,000 population increase from Romania and Bulgaria in each of the next five years."
The figures showed that in first three months of this year, the number of employed citizens from so-called A8 countries, which include Poland, rose by 74,000 to 802,000.
Over the same period, the number of Indians employed in the UK rose by 16,000 to 443,000 and the number of Australians and New Zealanders increased by 3,000 to 132,000.
Net migration figures showed an increase of 58,000 to 212,000.
Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said: "I think what has happened is reassuring for those people who kept calm and didn't buy into this story that we were going to have millions of people flooding the country from the Balkans."
