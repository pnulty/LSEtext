The report stage of the Immigration Bill concluded in the House of Lords on Monday April 7.
During this (three-day) phase of the bill’s passage through the House, peers continued to examine its provisions in fine detail. Many members took part in these vitally important debates, showing the upper chamber at its very best. Many hundreds voted in some, or all, of the five divisions that took place.
However, we find it surprising that not one of the three Ukip-affiliated peers chose to vote — let alone speak — during the passage of the bill: be it during report, committee or indeed second reading debate. Lord Stevens of Ludgate seemed to be ill — but where was former party leader Lord Pearson of Rannoch? Or Lord Willoughby de Broke?
There are of course no Ukip MPs and, as such, the House of Lords is their key avenue by which to hold the Government to account. When one considers the attitude of Ukip’s (would-be) parliamentarians to their roles in Westminster and elsewhere, their silence is deafening.
