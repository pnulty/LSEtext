THE ranting man confronted by a Guard at Buckingham Palace is a self-confessed illegal immigrant who wanted a "private audience" with the Queen.
Nigerian-born Tosin Odunaiya, 23, said he was stunned to be refused entry by the soldier — who's believed to be a Scot — and admitted it was the fifth time he had tried.
The Scottish Sun on Sunday reported his face-off with a soldier from the Coldstream Guards who pointed a rifle at him.
Odunaiya, who has a chest tattoo reading "Only God can judge me" and says he hates Britain, said the showdown began when he "told off" armed cops.
He said: "I was shouting louder and louder when the Guard came over and started shaking his gun at me.
"I said, 'You're a big boy now, are you?' and the Guard said, 'Yeah, I am a big boy' and shoved me away."
Odunaiya, of Kingston, South West London, added: "I wanted to speak with the Queen and presumed the Royal Family would have welcomed me as their lost son."
He also sent out a sinister tweet saying: "Why did you have to pull that Toy on me!? "If I die! I will come back at you with no mercy. Last warning."
