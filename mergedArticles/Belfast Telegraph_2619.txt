TWO illegal workers have been arrested and face deportation after they were found working in a Chinese restaurant in Banbridge. The Gaze restaurant is now facing a potential financial penalty of £20,000 after it was found to be employing the pair who were discovered during an operation carried out by a Home Office immigration enforcement team.
A statement said the operation was carried out at the Newry Street business last Thursday after intelligence was received.
"Officers arrested the two men, a 46-year-old who had entered the country illegally and a 24-year-old who had overstayed his visa, a Home Office statement said.
"Both are now in Home Office detention while steps are taken to remove them from the country." The business was served with a notice warning that a civil penalty of up to £10,000 per illegal worker found will be imposed unless proof is provided that the correct right-towork checks were carried out.
Mike Golden, from the Northern Ireland Immigration Enforcement Team, said: "Illegal working is not a victimless crime. It defrauds the taxpayer, undercuts honest employers and cheats legitimate job seekers out of employment opportunities."
