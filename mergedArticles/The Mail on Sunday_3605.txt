BARRY GARDINER has turned politics and climate change into a family affair - and a lucrative one at that.
The Brent North MP and wife Caroline live in a large £1.2 million detached house in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, which they bought for £700,000 in 2002.
In addition to her work as a sculptor and poet, Mrs Gardiner earns an estimated £25,000 as her husband's 'part time immigration adviser', as his constituency has a large ethnic population.
In the five years since MPs have had to declare family members on their Commons payroll, it is thought she has been paid around £100,000. Until recently, their daughter, Oxford politics graduate Bethany Gardiner-Smith, 26, worked for Globe International, who funded most of her father's foreign jaunts. She is now adviser to Labour MP Gloria De Piero, who serves alongside Mr Gardiner on Labour's front bench as the Shadow Women's Minister.
In addition to all his free travel, Mr Gardiner has found other ways of topping up his £66,396 MP's salary.
From 2007 to 2010 he received about £17,000 a year from Reynolds Partners, an investment bank, as its parliamentary adviser. Mr Gardiner was embroiled in the MPs' expenses scandal in 2009 as he made a £198,500 profit on Westminster flat funded with £81,935 in second homes expenses - just £14 short of the maximum - in four years. His claims included £11,000 for renovations, £235 on bed linen and £248 for a light. All were within Commons rules.
Mr Gardiner was told to repay £174 for mortgage interest overpaid - although he voluntarily repaid £15,404.
Privately educated Mr Gardiner, who studied at Cambridge University and Harvard in the US, entered Parliament in 1997 and was appointed Northern Ireland Minister by Tony Blair in 2005 and Environment Minister in 2006. He stepped down the next year when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister but was given the unpaid post of 'special representative on forestry'.
Mr Gardiner gave up the role in 2008 when he joined calls for Mr Brown to resign.
After Ed Miliband became Labour leader, Mr Gardiner was made Shadow Environment Minister. The job includes the floods portfolio. He is also Mr Miliband's 'special envoy on climate change'.
