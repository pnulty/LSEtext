A UKIP-supporting British Asian student has quit the party after accusing it of "deliberately attracting the racist vote".
Sanya-Jeet Thandi, 21 — described by leader Nigel Farage as the "future face of Ukip" — said their recent billboard poster campaign was the last straw.
Londoner Ms Thandi said: "The direction in which the party is going is terrifying."
Meanwhile David Cameron has admitted he hasn't brought immigration down by as much as he would like, saying the numbers were "still too high".
