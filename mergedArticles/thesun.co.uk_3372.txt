ED MILIBAND laid into Labour’s record on immigration yesterday - and insisted he WAS concerned about protecting Britains borders.
The Labour leader said his predecessors had “too often dismissed people’s concerns" about the problem.
And he gave the clearest sign yet that Labour would keep a cap on non-EU migrants if they win the 2015 General Election.
He added: “And we’ve got to reduce the pool of low-skilled migration into the UK."
Mr Miliband has previously admitted Labour miscalculated the numbers that would flock to Britain when controls on Poland and other East European nations were lifted in 2004.
The Office for National Statistics in February admitted there were nearly half a million more East Europeans in Britain than they thought.
Speaking in Wales yesterday, Mr Miliband said: “I am never going to tell you that Britain should turn its back on the world.
“It just won’t work. And it is not who we are. But I am not going to tell you either, nor should Labour ever tell you, that we should ignore people’s concerns about immigration."
The Labour leader told Sun Cabbie Grant Davis on Thursday that it was “unlikely" Britain would have an EU referendum under a Labour government.
