IMMIGRATION reforms could include a "wealth test" on foreigners looking to move to Britain. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said yesterday that future controls should ban migrants until their home country's economy had risen in value.
He claimed this would stop "vast migrations that take place from poorer countries to richer countries in the EU".
Mr Javid, a son of Pakistani immigrants, said foreigners had to learn English and "respect our way of life". He added: "I have met people who have been in Britain for over 50 years and still can't speak English."
