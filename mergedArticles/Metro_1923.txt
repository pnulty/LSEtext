VINCE CABLE has attacked Conservative 'scare stories' over immigration as a Home Office report revealed the impact on British jobs was far less than feared.
The business secretary's criticism came amid fresh research showing there was 'very little evidence' of migrant workers replacing Britons.
According to the study, there was some effect on lowskilled jobs but this was short-term. Its publication came as Mr Cable warned David Cameron the economy will be held back if the country is seen as 'closed for business'.
