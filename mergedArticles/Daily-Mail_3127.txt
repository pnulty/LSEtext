* Researchers from across Europe use system to compare voters' views with key pledges in the parties' manifestos
* Users asked if they agree or disagree with policies on the Euro, immigration, prison and the economy
* Polls suggest Ukip will benefit from a massive protest vote, and could even win on May 22
Voters are being given the chance to see which political party they actually agree with ahead of next month’s European elections.
A new test launched today asks people to say which policies they agree or disagree with – without knowing which party they belong to.
The UK Independence Party is tipped to top the polls on May 22 in what is being billed as one of the biggest ever protest votes against the main parties.

A new online tool developed by universities across Europe will place people’s views on the political spectrum. The EUVOX Voting Advice Application poses a series of questions about people’s political, economic and social views.
The responses will then be matched the manifestos of the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems, Ukip and Greens. Academics from Swansea University, Zurich University, Glasgow University and Queen’s University Belfast have worked on the project.
It is hoped the test will help to increase turnout at the European elections, which stood at just 34.7 per cent in 2009.
Zsolt Kiss, research director at NatCen Social Research, said: ‘The EUVOX offers an academically robust way for members of the public to see which political party most closely matches their own political views.
‘We hope it will be a useful tool for the public and that it will help raise awareness of the European elections among the UK electorate.’
According to the latest polls, thousands of voters are preparing to back Ukip in protest over Europe, immigration and disaffection with the three main parties.
A YouGov survey for The Sun yesterday showed 27 per cent of people plan to vote Ukp in the European election, but this more than halves to just 12 per cent when asked how they will vote in next year's general election.
For elections to Brussels, Labour is narrowly ahead on 30 per cent, with the Tories on 22 per cent, Lib Dems on 10 per cent and the Greens on 6 per cent.
When asked how they intend to vote in the general election, 37 per cent said Labour, 34 per cent Conservatives, 12 per cent Ukip, 10 per cent Lib Dem and 2 per cent Green.
Politics lecturer Dr. Matthew Wall, from Swansea University, said: ‘The project offers an exciting chance for academics who study elections to let the public profit from our research. That's why we place a lot of emphasis on transparency and our role in encouraging greater public engagement with politics.
‘We're also able to use the data we gather from these projects to refine our academic understanding of elections and voters.’
