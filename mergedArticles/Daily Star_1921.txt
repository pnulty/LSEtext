STAR Says..
AT last a politician talking sense on immigration.
Tory minister James Brokenshire says tight-fisted rich Brits are fuelling the immigration crisis by using cheap tradesmen.
The demand has sent thousands of cut-price workers flocking to our shores. And its hard-working Brits who are paying the price.
He's spot on. Thousands have had to play second-fiddle to cheap migrant labour just so wealthy families can save a few quid.
It's not right, and finally someone has had the balls to say it.
It's time to stop giving low-skilled migrants opportunities at the expense of our own people. But the wealthy have got to do their bit by putting homegrown workers first.
There's plenty of talent on offer here. They deserve the chance to work and provide for their families.
