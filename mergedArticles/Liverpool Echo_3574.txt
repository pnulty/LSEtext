A GROUP of 33 international students who were kicked off their university courses for not doing enough work today failed in a High Court challenge to the college's decision.
The mostly Asian accountancy students were part of a wider group of 56 who were accused of poor attendance or not signing up for enough modules.
Threatened with expulsion they secured a High Court injunction preventing Wrexham-based Glyndwr University taking away their immigration visa sponsorship. But when the case reached the court again yesterday, a judge rejected their challenge to Glyndwr, which has thousands of students from Merseyside.
The decision means their status in the UK will be reviewed by the Home Office.
