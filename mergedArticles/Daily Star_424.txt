TEACHER TWEETED ABUSE
A UKIP politician forced to quit the party after branding Scots workshy drunks during a Twitter row has been banned from teaching.
Ron Northcott posted the online slurs as he argued with a Scot over his leader Nigel Farage's hostile reception in Edinburgh last May.
Booze
He tweeted: "Northumberland Labour Party to set aside cut-price booze to entice Jocks over the Border. Too many drunken Jocks already at Westminster."
The secondary school teacher, who had been candidate for the party in Plymouth, also wrote: "I see we English still own the shirts on the Scots' backs."
Northcott, 66, was carpeted by an education disciplinary panel which found he was guilty of unacceptable professional conduct and behaviour that may bring the profession into disrepute.
He was banned indefinitely from teaching in any school or college in England.
Shamed Northcott, who was working at St Boniface's Roman Catholic college in Plymouth when he posted the slurs, was found to have made abusive comments about Scots, Catholics, Muslims and immigrants.
Northcott did not appear before the panel, after earlier claiming he was being targeted for his political opinions.
Northcott inisted that what he tweeted was "fact and not malicious".
Northcott took to Twitter to criticise Scots after Mr Farage was forced to seek refuge in an Edinburgh bar when he was faced by angry protesters.
