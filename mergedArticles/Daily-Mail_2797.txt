* 532,000 people arrived in Britain in year to September, up from 497,000
* 320,000 left the UK, down from 343,000 a year earlier, ONS says
* Number of Romanians and Bulgarians arriving almost trebles to 24,000
* Tories promised to cut net migration to less than 100,000 by 2015
David Cameron's pledge to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands' suffered a devastating blow today as figures showed the figure rose by a third in a single year.
The Conservatives vowed to reduce the gap between numbers arriving and leaving to fewer than 100,000 before the general election.
But in the year to September net migration hit 212,000, up from 154,000 in the same period in 2012 - a surge fuelled by arrivals from elsewhere in the European Union.
The Office for National Statistics said the sharp rise was 'statistically significant', including the number of Romanians and Bulgarians arriving in Britain almost trebling in a single year.
The government has been preparing for a sharp rise in the numbers from the two countries when work restrictions were liofted in January this year.
But today's figures show the influx was already underway last year, with 24,000 arriving from Romania and Bulgaria in the 12 months to September compared to just 9,000 in the year before.
In total 532,000 immigrants came to Britain in the latest period, up from 343,000 a year earlier.
At the same time 320,000 people left the UK, down slightly from 343,000 year-on-year.
It meant net migration - the difference between the number arriving and the number leaving - was 212,000 the highest since 2011 and higher than the last two full years of the Labour government.
The ONS said: 'There was a statistically significant increase in immigration of EU2 (Romanian and Bulgarian) citizens to 24,000 in the year ending September 2013 from 9,000 in the previous year. An
estimated 70 per cent arrived for work and 30 per cent for study.'
Overall net migration of all EU citizens doubled from 65,000 in the year ending September 2012 to 131,000 in the year ending September 2013.
In December Mr Cameron hinted that it was becoming increasingly difficult to meet his pledge to reduce net migration below 100,000. At that the latest figure was 182,000, well below today's figure of 212,000.
Speaking on a trip to China, the Prime Minister said: 'A lot of these things take an amount of time to be dealt with.’
He went on to point out that when the Tories set the goal of reducing net migration to tens of thousands a year - one which has never been accepted by the Liberal Democrats - at a time when emigration was helping to balance our immigration.
‘I made the pledge of trying to get net migration down to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands, on the basis that actually over the previous period migration flows within Europe have been relatively balancing out when it’s been migration from outside Europe that’s been topping up the numbers.
'We have seen that migration from outside Europe come down in terms of net figures and we need to make further progress.
‘So I’ll keep going on this. It’s very important. The British public want firm and consistent action on immigration and that’s exactly what they’re getting from me.’
