POLICE battling to keep the streets free of drunks have had to put up signs in Polish warning that alcohol is banned.
Officers in Worcester had the messages translated after mounting complaints about the growing menace of drunken immigrants in public places.
The plastic signs in English and Polish warn drinkers they are in alcohol-free zones, could have their booze confiscated and be slapped with Â£60 fines.
West Mercia officers are even being offered lessons in Polish so they can communicate with the thousands who have made the area their home.
Ukip Euro MP Gerard Batten said yesterday: "This is what mass multiculturalism and immigration has delivered. We now have to tell people in foreign languages what the law is.
"Dealing with foreign enclaves puts a strain on services. Creating special signs for the Polish community will cost the police money they can ill afford."
West Mercia Police say the signs are part of Operation Spartacus which has slashed alcohol-related antisocial behaviour since it was launched last October.
A spokesman said: "If we can educate people rather than reprimand them, then that is something we would rather do." ? A city suburb swamped by Roma immigrants exploded in violence after a mass brawl broke out following months of simmering tension between ethnic groups.
