It may please the White Anglo-Saxon Protestants of New England to claim that American history began in 1607 with the settlement of Jamestown by English immigrants, but the historian Fernández-Armesto rotates the historical perspective away from the standard Anglocentric narrative. He points out that in 1505 San Juan became the first city now in US territory to be settled by Europeans. Nowadays, the first Spanish colonies in Puerto Rico, Florida and the Southwest have a more significant meaning for electoral politics than the founding families of the Mayflower. Even fictional Hispano-American characters such as Zorro and the Cisco Kid, who battled bad gringos in defence of poor Californios, are now used to reinforce America’s heroic character. Just as the sense of being American brought British and Spanish colonists closer together in the 18th century, so the Hispanic history of America confirms the capacity of Americans to construct a cultural unity founded in diversity.
