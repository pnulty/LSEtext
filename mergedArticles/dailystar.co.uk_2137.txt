A BUNGLING security firm allowed asylum seekers to live a life of luxury in posh four-star hotels for more than a month.
G4S put them up at a £100-a-night Holiday Inn and a nearby Ramada Encore because it had run out of low-cost rooms.
The immigrants watched satellite TV and enjoyed free broadband and 24-hour room service – as well as being able to use the onsite Bannatyne health club.
More than 400 rooms were booked by the security firm at the two hotels in Barnsley between March and late April.
G4S spokesperson
The total cost to the taxpayer has not been disclosed but it is feared it could run into six figures.
Angry local Labour MP Dan Jarvis vowed to question Government ministers and said: “I will be seeking urgent assurances that mechanisms have been put in place to prevent this situation happening again.
“I will also raise the question of how much money has been spent on accommodating asylum seekers in hotels.” Fellow Labour MP Angela Smith added: “The Home Office needs to explain why it failed to work with Barnsley Council when this situation emerged.”
A G4S spokesman said: “We were short of accommodation in the region and they ended up in there.
“It was far fewer than 400 rooms and they were only there for a few days.”

But he denied the taxpayers picked up the tab and insisted: “Any extra expense was borne by us.”
The Home Office said they were aware G4S had used a hotel in Barnsley for temporary accommodation for “a short period of time” but this had now ended.
