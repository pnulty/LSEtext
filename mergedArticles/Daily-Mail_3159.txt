ERRORS by immigration inspectors meant hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans entered Britain without being counted, officials revealed yesterday.
A report found checks were being carried out at the wrong airports, leading to 350,000 people being added to the population without figuring in data compiled by the Office for National Statistics.
Immigration surveys were taken at the biggest airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester - while hundreds of thousands arrived at smaller terminals such as Luton and Stansted.
Meanwhile migrants travelling by ferry were barely counted and tens of thousands of children entered Britain unchecked.
The ONS's confession appears to explain why Whitehall failed to grasp the scale of immigration from Eastern Europe.
