A benefits fraudster whose 18-year scam financed a property empire in her native Uganda was ordered to repay more than £1.5 million or spend an additional six years in prison.
Ruth Nagubuzi, 50, was the head of the "family business" and is serving a six-year sentence after admitting fraud. Up to 100 fake children's identities were created to obtain money from the Department for Work and Pensions, and Nagubuzi claimed to have HIV and Aids to obtain free medicine, which she sold in Africa for huge profits.
She controlled 15 properties in Britain, sub-letting them to immigrants while receiving housing benefit payments totalling £650,000. The rent from tenants netted her about £756,000.
Nagubuzi, of Manor Park, East London, used her illegal profits to finance the construction of two complexes, which incorporated hotels, restaurants and a shopping centre, in her home town of Kampala. "She ran a large-scale thriving business and had almost unlimited access to false identification," said Judge Nicholas Ainley yesterday at Croydon Crown Court.
