Mad as hell – Peter Finch's famous rant
Nigel Farage had yet to appear on LBC when I sat down with Eric Pickles on Friday morning to discuss Ukip, the prospect for the Tories and the state of the Coalition. The Communities Secretary, no doubt aware of the perils of appearing to repeat Dave's "fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists" insult, made a point of absolving Ukip of the charge that it is a racist party. He's technically right: its policies are patently not concerned with either race or ethnicity. But he damned them nevertheless as xenophobic, uber-nationalist, and shameful on immigration. He said there were certainly racists in the party and some of its politicians used racism for political ends. they may not be racist, therefore, but for Mr Pickles they remain a fairly unpleasant outfit.
If you haven't had a chance to read it yet, he also dismisses the southern toffs charge against the Tories, claiming it's usually levelled by elite, lefty southern toffs. He says the tide is turning in the Tories' favour. He compares the anger of voters to that scene in Network (see above) when Peter Finch gets everyone to open their windows and shout "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore". He dismissers the Gove v Clegg row as an "unedifying scrap" and says special advisers should be reined in. And, at a time when Tories are muttering that the Coalition was a mistake and they want out, he is unashamed: he's proud of what it has achieved, not least saving the country from financial destruction.
