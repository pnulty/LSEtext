GOOD quality care depends on many things. Innate kindness, patience and empathy are important but these qualities cannot be taught.
Another is the ability to communicate with the people who are being looked after. Communication can include a touch or a smile but it must also mean speaking the same language. 
There is nothing more frustrating for the carer or the person in their care if neither can understand what the other is saying. It can lead to frustration, to anger and even to abuse. It is a particularly acute problem if the patient is suffering from dementia.
Many carers working here today are migrants, doing the essential and not-very-well-paid jobs that sadly many Britons have no wish to do. Many are splendid and the caring professions could not function without them. 
But it is right that the issue of poor language skills has been highlighted and that proficiency in English should be part of the new “care certificate”. This would be a guarantee for employers and patients that healthcare assistants and support workers have all the necessary skills. 
As Dr Shereen Hussein, adviser to the Department of Health, outlines, ability in English can be tested through a simple interview process. It is not, as they say, rocket science. But it would be beneficial and also send a signal that even in a country of many immigrants English must be spoken.

This is no kind of justice
The vicious and unprovoked punch which resulted in the death of Andrew Young, who suffered from Asperger’s syndrome, was caught on CCTV. 
There can be no doubting the savagery of Lewis Gill’s assault which took place in Bournemouth last November. Gill was sentenced to four years for manslaughter but was referred to the Court of Appeal by Attorney General Dominic Grieve who believed rightly that the sentence did not reflect the seriousness of the crime. Unfortunately the appeal judges have now decided that the length of the sentence cannot be extended. 
Four years for the life of an innocent man. In reality this will mean that Gill, still in his early 20s, will be released after serving half that sentence. What an appalling travesty of justice.

Come on, give us a hug
Forget British reserve. The British are turning into a country of huggers, embracing each other several times a day with various degrees of ease and intimacy. 
It can’t be long before a national group hug is in order
