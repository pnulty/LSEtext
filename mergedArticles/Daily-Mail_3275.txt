ADOLF Hitler's birthplace is to become an integration centre for immigrants.
Austrian officials keen to end a row over the house where the German dictator was born in 1889 are close to a deal to turn it into a centre which will provide language lessons for new arrivals. The plan is seen as a fitting response to Hitler's racist policies.
He spent the first three years of his life in what was then a pub in Braunau am Inn. In 1938 it was bought by the Fuhrer's private secretary, Martin Bormann. Since the Second World War, the building has been used as a public library and later a bank.
