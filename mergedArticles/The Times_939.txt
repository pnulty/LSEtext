Stalking celebrities, tip-offs, high-speed chases, dust-ups, machetes wielded in the street... It's all in a day's work for Vladimir Labissiere, an LA paparazzo
Vladimir Labissiere sits off Sunset Boulevard in his new black Mercedes E350. He's monitoring the competition and talking about the time the actor Woody Harrelson jumped his ass and said he was a zombie.
He is parked in an alley across from the London hotel, one of his favourite haunts. Labissiere spends a lot of time in alleys waiting for his shots. That's when he's not trailing behind celebrity SUVs that are taking tots home from play dates.
Vlad, 40, 6ft 3in, is a pap, singular for paparazzi, the despised shooters who bring you all pictures you claim to loathe but actually stare at online for hours. Vlad's Mercedes is hidden because he doesn't want another pap to jump his shot. Paps are known by their nicknames - Bam-Bam, Zazy, Top Hat Rick and Mexican Vlad, not to be confused with our Vlad, who is also known as the Black Russian.
He's one of hundreds of photographers who represent a tripped-out rainbow of the American dream - Haitian-Americans like Vlad, aviator-wearing Persians, Brazilians with questionable immigration status, Mexican-Americans in broken-down vans, Eurotrash in leather jackets and the occasional Caucasian dude on a motorcycle - trying to make a living on anywhere from $10,000 to $150,000 a year by photographing every move an A, B or D-lister makes, short of using the toilet. Some of the stars hate them, some of the stars use them in a now estimated billion-dollar business, where millions of insatiable readers scan websites, magazines and television shows for the tiniest scrap of information on the second lead in a reality show. Right now, Vlad's waiting on British pop singer Jessie J to emerge and head to a nearby recording studio. Vlad checks her Instagram page and sees that she's at the rooftop pool, so it will be a while. He starts talking about his encounter with Harrelson in 2009, as hip-hop blasts from his radio. At the time he was shooting for the gossip website TMZ and caught Harrelson and his daughter coming off a flight.
"I'm asking questions, trying to keep it light. 'Hey, Woody, so how you feelin', man? I know you must be a little out of it, but... are those pants made out of hemp?'
And the dude bumrushes me and smashes my camera to s***. I'm like, 'Woody, that's assault, that's assault.'" It was Vlad's first meltdown with a star, but it wouldn't be his last. There have been runins with Robert De Niro's driver, Hopper Penn - Sean Penn's son - and actress Amanda Bynes in the past four years. He stops talking. Another pap is walking up, a smile on his face. Vlad won't roll down the window.
"That dude is a leech," says Vlad. "He's a virus, yo, a parasite motherf***er. Every f***in' day he just runs around, jumpin' on s***. But his bitch ass will have a f***in' cow if you jump on his s***." He slips into a decent Cockney accent: "Eh! Come on, mate, you're jumping my shot."
Vlad speaks in his own personal English Esperanto with made-up phrases - eg, "funky pumper" for a woman's backside - blended through a childhood split between Port-Au-Prince and Flatbush, Brooklyn. The Brit trudges away. Vlad goes back to talking about Woody. Luckily, he had another minicam and started filming Harrelson with that.
"He jumps on my back. Now I'm like, 'Dude! Seriously? Come on!' The asshole is piggybacking on me, punching at me. I'm like, 'Word?'" Paps live on situational awareness - a sixth sense anticipating what is going to happen next. Vlad spies a double-decker bus heading down Sunset Boulevard. But this one is different from the tour buses trawling through West Hollywood on the lookout for Kanye West and Kim Kardashian leaving the Chateau Marmont hotel. On the side is a Playboy logo; the seats are filled with dozens of bunnies. Vlad throws the Mercedes into drive.
The Brit follows in his SUV. Vlad is displeased. He cuts the dude off and barks more creative obscenities. He catches up to the Playboy bus on Sunset. He jumps out of the car and starts shooting. The girls wave and blow kisses.
"Hey, girls, looking lovely." He locks eyes with an Asian bunny. "I like you."
It all takes three minutes. Vlad takes the Mercedes back to the London hotel. Oh, yeah, Woody. After Harrelson finally stalked away, Vlad called in to the TMZ office. He told them he'd been attacked, but the office had other concerns. They wanted to know if he had video. (He did.) Vlad's face sags a bit. "This dude just attacked me, and all I hear back is, 'Did you get the shot?' not 'Are you OK?'" The Mercedes is back in position. Vlad stares at the hotel-lobby entrance. And he waits.
Vlad's spent much of his twenties and early thirties in New York, doing street marketing for clothing lines such as Bad Boy Productions and Phat Farm. He started taking pictures of his clients and their parties and found he loved it. A mutual friend introduced him to someone at TMZ in 2008, and they gave him a camera. On his first day, he used his height to hoist his camera over a wall and shoot Madonna as she left her house. He was hooked.
Vlad became a TMZ star, scoring some of the first pictures and video of a smiling Rihanna after Chris Brown, her boyfriend at the time, beat her. But the aggressive style that got him noticed as a quick riser in the pap life also became his downfall. A few months after the Harrelson run-in, TMZ fired him because he seemed to enjoy talking to the press. He moved out to Los Angeles with his daughters and their mother because of the weather and the sheer density of celebrities. His kill-or-bekilled attitude followed him. Vlad's blend of persistence and aggression made him more than $100,000 last year, which is on the high end of the pap salary scale.
One day, while driving through Beverly Hills, Vlad pulls the car over and whips out his camera. No one is there, just a yard sign for a two-bedroom apartment. "I want to give my daughter a princess room," he whispers. His right leg is covered in a guardian-angel tattoo with both his daughters' names spelled out.
Currently, Vlad lives in West Hollywood so he can step out and shoot stars the moment he wakes up, but he only has a one-bedroom. He takes Kaydence to school and picks her up in the afternoon, but she usually sleeps at her mum's. (He also has a 19-year-old daughter, Kasie, in college.) That doesn't mean father and daughter aren't close - they are, in a pap way. There's footage of a Brad Pitt stakeout outside a café in LA where the actor was hosting a birthday party for his daughter. You can see Kaydence on Vlad's shoulders in the mob; they'd been shopping at the same store.
Vlad shoots for Splash, one of the largest photo agencies, and gets a 60-40 split on all sales. But except for the obvious stuff - a shot of, say, Bieber emerging from a car in a cloud of cannabis smoke - it's maddening trying to figure out what will sell. A good Gerard Butler shot earned Vlad only 60 bucks, but a crummy photo of Jessica Alba scored him $900 last month. Why?
Alba is carrying a Christian Dior bag, and Christian Dior bought the picture. Other photos, like Jessie J, have almost no value in the States but will be huge sellers overseas. Sometimes, it's dumb luck. Top Hat Rick found himself immersed in a crowd in Hancock Park when Prince William and Kate Middleton emerged from the British Consulate-General's house in 2011, and he made $20,000. Older paps make money on their archives, but Vlad has been doing this for only a few years, so there's no iconic shot in his catalogue bringing in dough every month.
In the two weeks that I followed Vlad, he abandoned me and his Mercedes on Sunset Boulevard on a Saturday night so he could shoot actress Molly Shannon, berated me for bringing a banana into his ride, fell at singer Chaka Khan's feet, and shot George Clooney on his way to picking up a girlfriend for date night. He also called actor Ashley Tisdale a name not uttered in polite society after the star used her niece as a shield to ward off Vlad and other paps.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves. I first met him at King's Road Café in West Hollywood, a quiet restaurant that Vlad semi-hates because he's had to shoot Glee star Jane Lynch there repeatedly.
"She's always like, 'Again?'" Well, "had to" is a relative term; paps like Vlad are an OCD bunch of characters. If they see a celeb, they pathologically need to shoot them, even if they just nailed them four hours ago, which is why no celeb believes a pap when he says, "Just one shot, and I'm gone."
It was a few days after Vlad had been pulled over by the Beverly Hills Police Department while tailing American Hustle actress Amy Adams. Across the street is a West Elm store where Vlad recently shot actress Isla Fisher. Like many famous people, Fisher has an intuition about paps and somehow sensed Vlad's presence parked outside. She induced a sales clerk to walk out in front of her and even slid in on the passenger side of her car. Vlad still got the picture.
"Bbrrraaatt," says Vlad, making a noise that sounds like semiautomatic gunfire. "That picture sold, son, for about 500 bucks." He has an imaginary conversation with Fisher. "You blocked. It sold. Clap. Thank you!" Federico Fellini named a photographer Paparazzo - conjuring the sound made by an annoying, buzzing insect - in his 1960 film La Dolce Vita, and the name has stuck, morphing into the plural paparazzi.
It's not an easy life, and it's getting harder. New legislation went into effect in California on January 1, preventing paps from shooting kids in an alarming manner based on their parents' fame. This sucks for the paps, since mom-and-kid shots sell best. The new law was spearheaded by Halle Berry after being swarmed by paps at Los Angeles Airport last year. "Jesus, what is wrong with you people?" she screamed. "That's a child here."
In January, actors Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, the parents of a one-year-old, launched a campaign against what they named the "pedorazzi", and proclaimed their refusal to do interviews with outlets that use unauthorised shots of stars' kids.
"It's hilarious," says Rick "Top Hat Rick" Mendoza, a pap best known for suing Britney Spears after she ran over his foot. "Kristen comes up with a new hate word - pedorazzi - and goes on this campaign just as her movie Veronica Mars is coming out. What a coincidence! Now who's manipulating who?" in the line of fire Jennifer Buhl, who spent three years as a top LA pap, on the rules of the game Celebrities Our biggest competition because of Instagram and Twitter - they're now posting shots of themselves, in a bikini or with their baby, for free. What makes a celebrity hot? Beautiful, under 40, on the screen. Pregnancy or being part of a supercouple makes them hotter - take Mila Kunis, it's rumoured she's pregnant and with Ashton Kutcher. Neither of them likes being papped. If they tweet a picture of the baby when it's born it will negate the value of a paparazzi shot.
Pricing a newborn If a child is photographed rarely (once in the first year) a picture will make a paparazzo a heck of a lot of money. If the first baby picture is shot on a Tuesday and the second on Wednesday, etc, then a shot will only be worth a few hundred dollars.
Exclusivity The longer the exclusive lasts, the more money you make. The last picture of Michael Jackson was an exclusive that would never be trumped. That went for a couple of million dollars.
Rates I don't know any pap that's made more than $30,000 on one shot. I was one of the best and I never made more than $8,000 on a shot. I made $8,000 a few times a year. That was Matthew McConaughey on Malibu beach. Bathing suit shots always do well: Jessica Alba was a good one. Kristen Stewart smoking pot. When Robbie Williams came out of rehab I made $5,000.
Top target Kim Kardashian makes the paparazzi the most money right now. She's popular all over the world. That's key. When I was shooting a few years ago Paris Hilton would sell everywhere. You might not make ten grand on a photo but you're always making at least a thousand. When there are a lot of paps after her it's called a gang bang. Long lens shots How I caught Kristen Stewart smoking pot.
Rising stock The reasons celebrities go up in value are rehab, a new romance or a break-up. Gwyneth Paltrow with another guy would probably make $15,000-plus. Bikini shots Always big sellers. That never changes. Go to Malibu in the summer, get a few in your library. The Kardashians are probably shot in their bikinis too much, but Victoria Beckham would be good. Has she ever been shot in a bikini? You always make money when they're on the beach.
So where's the line? There's a popular Hallowe'en spot in West Hollywood called Mr Bones Pumpkin Patch. Glammed-up celeb mums parade their children down slides and past face-painting stands, while paps get their shots from a designated shooting pen. There are now at least 35,000 shots of celebs cavorting in Mr Bones Pumpkin Patch in photo archives. Stars like Matt Damon - who scrupulously guards his kids' privacy - simply don't take them to pap hot zones like Mr Bones. Berry has brought her daughter there many times. That's her right, but it doesn't suggest she's trying to keep a low profile with her kids.
"Halle can take her kid there," says Mendoza. "But if she does, I have a right to shoot them. That's America."
This is all happening as the world gets smaller. There is less "big game" like Jackie O and Michael Jackson out there, replaced by a bewildering galaxy of feral reality stars, former criminals and famous-people spawn - such as Jackson's son Prince, whose martial-arts lessons regularly attract a dozen paps. Events now move quicker than Vlad's shutter.
In the Nineties, you might get a shot of, say, Madonna looking ragged, and you'd have a few days to start a bidding war before selling it to People magazine. Now it's a race to beat the celeb from posting her own photo on Instagram or another pap from uploading the photo to INF or Splash, two of the largest photo agencies, and then the agency selling your competitor's photo before you've even pressed send. You think texting and driving is dangerous? Vlad and other paps shoot, drive and upload simultaneously.
"It's become the Wild West out there," says one of Hollywood's top publicists. "Now you have so many more paps trying to bait the client into a fight. I tell my clients, 'Don't try to outrun them, don't fall into their trap.' It's exponentially worse than ten years ago. It's just nuts, and someone is going to get killed."
TMZ has not helped. (The company got its name from the "30-mile zone," the area of celebrich LA spinning out from West Hollywood.) TMZ founder Harvey Levin was a lawyer who reported the OJ trial on television before creating Celebrity Justice, tabloid television that focused on the legal snafus of the stars. Starting up TMZ in 2005 was a logical next step.
TMZ has taken the illusion of privacy away. Now the paranoid star just assumes someone is always there. Decoy cars and false itineraries are floated to throw TMZ off the scent. And then there's the money. TMZ has the cash to buy off valets and info like flight lists or even the limo list of what celeb is being picked up where and when.
A little after 1pm, Jessie J finally appears. An SUV pulls out of the London hotel and Vlad follows. Jessie J is in the back seat. He trails her to Record Plant studios, powering by her on Melrose so he can arrive a minute or two early and set up. He's already on the pavement and shooting when a security guy asks him to let Jessie's mum pass. Vlad consents and then snags Jessie wearing a wig and a tired smile.
"Jessie's huge in England," he says. "I'll shoot her every day, and I'll have a complete story to sell."
He drives away, but screeches the brakes as a white Range Rover buzzes through an intersection. He flips a U-turn. "Hold on, hold on, hold on, look at it... Yeah, it is! January Jones!" Vlad squints at the number plate and urges other cars to get out of his way. "Yeah, '047.' Move, get the f*** outta the way. Come on, drive, bitch! Come on!"
The best paps have hundreds of licence plates committed to memory - one once rattled off to me the numbers for almost every $125,000 Mercedes G wagon in Los Angeles. Some celebs know it and constantly switch cars; Vlad claims he's seen One Direction's Harry Styles driving half a dozen different vehicles. He sticks close to Jones, but not close enough to spook her.
"If she has the kid, she's going to, whatchamacallit, a play date. If she's with the kid, it's even better."
Vlad might make about $500 for an exclusive Jones shot, but could make twice that for one with her child. The car pulls up to a house in a nondescript neighbourhood. Vlad can see a toddler in a car seat.
We sit for 15 minutes, and a woman gets out of the Range Rover, but it's not Jones or her child. She drives off, and we follow some more. Jones creeps a few miles under the speed limit. Vlad giggles.
"I love it when people know that you're following them and they drive a certain way."
Eventually, Vlad breaks off the chase, reasoning Jones is heading home to Los Feliz, and that won't work. Jones's house has an automatic gate. He won't get anything good. He takes a left and heads for Beverly Hills, where he's heard that Mark Wahlberg is walking around in a sharp suit.
But as he heads down Melrose, he sees a crowd of paps gathered outside the Urth Caffé, a trendy health-food restaurant. He jumps out, and the paps whisper Kylie Jenner is on her way. She is the half-sister of Kim Kardashian, which seems slightly less on the fame scale than a movie star, but not in the pap marketplace, where 42-year-old Wahlberg is ancient. "F*** Mark Wahlberg," shouts Vlad as he joins a scrum. "This is worth ten times that."
Jenner arrives with a friend, but she pulls her hair down over her face. Vlad is pissed off. It's a commonplace attitude of the paps - indignation when a target refuses to give it up.
"Bitch, stop covering up. Let motherf***ers shoot you and get it over with," he mutters. "All this attitude. Someone like Angelina Jolie would just give us the shot - she's beautiful." Vlad doesn't mention that Jenner is 16 and Jolie is 38.
On the other hand, Vlad does have a point. Celebs who hit the West Hollywood/Beverly Hills quadrant are not exactly trying to keep a low profile. Probably 90 per cent of pap shots in Los Angeles are taken in West Hollywood and Beverly Hills, where Vlad trawls.
The ugly secret is, some stars want to be hunted. During the Great Britney Spears Hunt of 2007, she would reportedly call select paps right before moving. Kim Kardashian routinely tipped off the paps in her early days. Someone falling off the fame radar, like actors Denise Richards or Tori Spelling, will make arrangements for paps to come over and shoot them with their kids.
"Sometimes publicists tip off the paps without telling their clients," says Scott Cosman, owner of the photo agency FameFlynet. "They think their client needs the hit, but the star might think it's beneath them, so they just leak the information."
Sometimes it's about reframing the narrative. Before Angelina Jolie became a humanitarian, she was best known for wearing a vial of blood around her neck and kissing her brother. After she adopted seven-monthold Maddox from a Cambodian orphanage, Jolie carefully orchestrated a photoshoot with an approved pap that repositioned her image from troubled goth to responsible adult. After she started dating Brad Pitt, it was leaked to a photo agency that they would be taking their first big vacation at Kenya's Diani Beach, not exactly a pap hangout. (Now the couple are among the toughest celebs to snap, vacationing where paps can't get to without an AmEx black card and a helicopter.)
Many celebs simply like the cash. Lindsay Lohan has tipped off paps about her next stop in return for a gratuity. Ryan Reynolds is known to have an antagonistic relationship with the paparazzi, but recently he has been "captured" eating Chobani yogurt, carrying a Burger King bag, smiling at a Nespresso café and caressing a Can-Am motorcycle, all in apparently preplanned shots. Vlad isn't concerned with such philosophical matters. He's too busy waiting on Jenner and staring down the UK guy from earlier today. "I'd slit his throat! He keeps jumping s***."
In the fungible ethics of pap life, there's no point mentioning to Vlad that actually he's the one who jumped the Jenner shot. Soon, there are 20 to 25 paps outside the restaurant. They're all looking for the one shot that differentiates from what is charmingly known in the pap business as a gang bang.
Meanwhile, Jenner's car pulls around back, and she sneaks out before anyone gets a clear shot. Vlad guns his car up Melrose a few blocks ahead of Jenner and the pursuing mob.
Vlad sees her in his rearview mirror and pulls in right behind her. He stays on Jenner's bumper until the car makes an abrupt right into the parking lot of a posh nail salon.
In a minute, a dozen cars bring 20 paps. But there's no shot, and she disappears inside. A horde of paps hems in a car driven by a Jenner fan who had followed them from the Urth Caffé. He yells at them to move and not touch his car. No one listens. The driver hits the horn and pulls out a long knife - more like a mini-machete - from under his seat. He is just a kid. Vlad screams at him.
"What happened? Yeah! Pull it out! You ain't gonna do a single thing."
He's right; the kid puts the blade away and drives off. The other paps give Vlad space. He stalks back to his car. He says it's no big deal. "Get the f*** out here, you pull a humongous knife? I've had motherf***ers flash guns. He wasn't gonna do s***."
This all might sound creepy and gross, and it is. But there's a camaraderie and an adrenaline rush, a modern version of a gang of Dickensian pickpockets. Half the guys split, but the others dig in. They're not going to make any money - an exclusive shot of Jenner might make you a grand; a gang-bang shot with hair in her eyes might make you 100 bucks - but now it's a matter of principle.
Day turns to night. Finally, three hours later, Jenner emerges from the nail salon. She slinks out with a half-wave but with her hair still over her face. About a dozen paps have hung on, including Vlad. He gets an almost usable shot before she gets into the car. The camera flashes light the night and, for a moment, blind Jenner. She's disorientated and almost backs into a pole. A video pap named Malibu Rich yells at her.
"You're about to run over a kid on a bike!" There's no bike, no kid. The paps crack up. Jenner is impassive in the driver's seat. The Mercedes pulls away, and the paps head for home or night-time stakeouts of clubs and restaurants.
Vlad drives in silence. He passes graffiti spray-painted on the side of a gas station reading STOP MAKING DUMB PEOPLE FAMOUS. He doesn't notice.
It's a few days later, and Vlad has a tip from someone at LAX.
"The airport. Kim is back in town." Every generation gets the primo pap target they deserve, and America has gone from Jackie to Madonna to Britney to Kim Kardashian, queen of the reality world. It's a progression we really shouldn't dwell on. Kardashian is flying in from the Paris fashion shows on a Delta-Air France. Delta is problematic for celebrities.
An ex-pap showed me a sample of daily emails that TMZ acquires, listing all the stars flying on the airline. Vlad pulls into LAX, and it's a full gang bang, maybe 40 paps, but he's here because she's the most famous pap target of his career and he hopes that through some miracle he can get a special shot.
A few minutes later, someone screams. "Here she comes."
And there's Kardashian, all in black, except for a fur-lined tan coat. She's wearing big sunglasses. Paps are shouting questions.
"Kim, is Bruce going to have a sex change?" "Kim, is your family Shakespearean?" Vlad's face bobs above the sea of humanity, but he doesn't have a shot. So he peels off and runs out through the sliding doors and jumps up on a concrete barrier and shoots downward, ripping off 70 frames. In 30 seconds, it's over. Kim is stashed in a black SUV and is gone.
Vlad frantically scans his pictures. A giant smile breaks across his face, and he skips away, pirouetting in a crosswalk. It's the happiest I've ever seen him. He sits in the Mercedes and looks closer. The simultaneous flash of 50 cameras has lit Kardashian in an ethereal way. Today, she looks like a movie star. Vlad has a couple of killer shots of her from head to toe. He starts crowing.
"Got her, full frame! And the winner is... me! Trix are for kids! They always want to wolf-pack around her, so I got above them."
Vlad heads back towards Hollywood, still buzzing. We're stuck in traffic, but Vlad doesn't care. By the time he gets back, the Daily Mail will have a story up with all his pictures. He says he might make $10,000 once resales are factored in. This is unlikely - agencies will be flooded with gang-bang photos of Kim from LAX and will be happy to go with a slightly crappier photo to save some bucks. Later, once the adrenaline wears off, he admits he'll make only $1,000.
He drives in happy silence for a while before telling me another story. A few days ago, Vlad was trailing Kim's brother, Rob, in Beverly Hills. Rob is part of the collateral damage of the Kardashian story - Bruce Jenner's sanity is the other - putting on 50lb last year after breaking up with his girlfriend Rita Ora. According to the tabloids, his family is disgusted by his weight gain. For Vlad, he's still a good "get".
Eventually, Rob pulled over and Vlad approached his car. In a calm voice, Rob told Vlad he was trying to get his life together and wasn't even on the show this season.
"I just want to show your growth and how you're losing the weight," said Vlad.
But Rob politely said no again. Then Vlad did a very un-Vlad thing. He said OK, catching Rob by surprise. The pap and subject looked each other in the eye.
"Look, you guys have helped me achieve something I couldn't in a 9 to 5," Vlad said. "I would have never seen half the money I make now."
And then Vlad let him drive away. "Why did I do it? I don't want to be the bad guy."
Two months later, Vlad had his camera temporarily seized by Beverly Hill cops for taking unauthorised shots of Hilary Duff's kid at a playground. But right now, he jerks the Mercedes onto the hard shoulder and passes a dozen cars. He rolls down the windows and laughs loudly.
"F*** being the bad guy."
