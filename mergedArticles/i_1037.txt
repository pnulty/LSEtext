Ukip's "hostility and extremism" needs to be challenged, Yvette Cooper said yesterday as she claimed it remains too easy for "dodgy employers" to exploit immigration. The shadow home secretary warned Nigel Farage's eurosceptics will continue "playing on people's fears" if the Government fails to deal with the impact of immigration.
She called for reforms to stop agencies and employers using cheap overseas labour to halt UK wages and jobs being undercut.
Ms Cooper made the remarks as the battle for votes ahead of Thursday's European and council elections intensifies, with polls suggesting Ukip will enjoy strong support.
"The Government needs to address the impact of immigration or Ukip will be able to keep playing on people's fears," she said.
"We need practical solutions to the concerns that people have about their jobs and wages."
