"The number of Romanians and Bulgarians employed in the first three months of 2014 rose 25% year-on-year." Since when is immigrants actually getting a job a problem? Better than them doing nothing but claiming benefits. If Farage is so worried about low wages, why doesn''t he work for a raise in the minimum wage? Oh, wait. Silly me. He doesn''t want to solve problems; he wants to scare people into voting for him.
WhatWasThat13 That''s the oddest thing I''ve heard in ages. The number of people who have drunk in that bar over the years and then they suddenly become censors of a leader of a legitimate registered political party. Stephen5000
