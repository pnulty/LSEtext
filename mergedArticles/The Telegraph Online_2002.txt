Ukip leader Nigel Farage says he will not have his party being told they are "racist", and that he believes most of their new voters are coming from Labour or from non-voters
Ukip party leader Nigel Farage has said he believes he believes most of their new voters are coming from Labour or from non-voters, rather than former conservative supporters as is commonly thought.
Speaking in Slough, he also said he will not have his party being told they are "racist".
Mr Farage added: "The establishment are closing ranks against Ukip because Ukip are on the side of the majority of voters in this country."
This comes after Mr Farage was accused of aping far-right tactics and attracting extremists to his cause ahead of the May 22 European elections.
A series of controversies over offensive comments made by candidates and supporters and a stark anti-EU immigration poster campaign have failed to dent Ukip's soaring poll ratings which have put it on course to top the national poll.
