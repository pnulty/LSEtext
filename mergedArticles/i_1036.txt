Immigrants to Britain need to learn to speak English and to "respect our way of life", the new Culture Secretary, Sajid Javid, has said.
Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants and the first Asian Secretary of State, said people were entitled to expect that immigrants made a contribution to society.
"People want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right," he told The Sunday Telegraph.
"People also say, when immigrants do come to Britain, that they should come to work, and make a contribution and that they should also respect our way of life, and I agree with all of that. It means things like trying to learn English."
Mr Javid was appointed Culture Secretary in early April after the resignation of Maria Miller.
His intervention comes at a time when the Conservatives are under intense pressure from the UK Independence Party over the issue of immigration ahead of Thursday's European elections.
Mr Javid, who is also Minister for Equalities, criticised those who had failed to assimilate into British society despite living in the country for many years.
"I know people myself, I have met people who have been in Britain for over 50 years and they still can't speak English," he said.
"I think it's perfectly reasonable for British people to say, look, if you're going to settle in Britain and make it your home, you should learn the language of the country and you should respect its laws and its culture."
He added that the "vast majority" of immigrants wanted to integrate into British society.
