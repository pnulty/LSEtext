IMMIGRANTS from Europe are responsible for only one per cent of all crimes committed in England, a study shows. Romanians in the Home Counties, Polish and Latvians in Lincolnshire, Polish communities in Cumbria and Italians in Surrey were identified as creating very localised problems by researchers from Northumbria University. However, in terms of total crime in those areas, the impact of migrants is minimal and does not warrant scaremongering headlines, the researchers believe. 'The findings suggest that there is no national issue,' said Derek Johnson, senior lecturer in geography and crime science.
