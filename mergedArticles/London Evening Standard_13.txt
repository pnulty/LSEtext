DAVID CAMERON v ED MILIBAND Ground: Manifesto Kick-off: 10am With three polls putting the Tories just one point behind, Labour hopes were fading that it was just a blip. Cameron chose the moment to announce that the next Tory manifesto will cut inheritance tax — a sign of rising confidence. Miliband was being berated by a coalition of nervous party grandees while backbenchers were asking him to stop sounding like an academic. Tense times for the Labour leader, though he has survived tough patches before — and is still, lest we forget, ahead. Score: Cameron 1, Miliband 0 QUOTE OF THE DAY 'It's the muscle behind the message that I think Mr Putin will look at' Former Chief of the General Staff Lord Dannatt on the Ukraine crisis COMMONS WHISPERS ¦Boris Johnson was asked by Conservative campaign headquarters to help the Tories' local elections effort in Kew. But the sight of him with a loudspeaker sparked rumours he wants to be the next MP for Richmond. They were hotly denied today.
In his X-rated (and very funny) memoirs, former MP Jerry Hayes recalls being thumped by David Mellor on his debut at the Commons. "It's always good to hit a new Tory MP on the first day," cackled Mellor, walking off.
