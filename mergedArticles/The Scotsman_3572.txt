MUSIC: ANAIS MITCHELL
American singer/songwriter Mitchell, inset, has been anointed the "queen of modern folk music" for her willingness to embrace big themes, classic stories and ambitious projects, her latest being Child Ballads, which features her take on a selection of the Scots and English folk ballads gathered by Francis Child in the late 19th century. She returns to Glasgow as part of the Fallen Angels Club 10th anniversary celebrations.

ART: NEW ACQUISITIONS
New Acquisitions at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art tells a remarkable story of imaginative collecting in difficult times. There are a lot of good things to see, a lot of them by modern Scottish artists, some well-known, but others hardly known at all. It's worth making the trip while they are still on the wall.
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, until 4 May, 0131-624 6200

THEATRE: GLLASGOW GIRLS
For a Scotland on the brink of big decisions about its future, there's no finer feelgood musical than Glasgow Girls, last year's smash-hit show about the seven Glasgow schoolgirls who - in the mid-2000s - staged a successful campaign to prevent the immigration authorities from deporting their asylum-seeker schoolmates and friends. With music by director Cora Bissett, Soom T, Patricia Panther and the Kielty Brothers, Glasgow Girls is a funny and moving love-song to the idea of a modern, multicultural Glasgow, strongly based on a true story; it lifts the heart, and throws in some fine tunes, for good measure.
Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow, until 8 March, 0141-429 0022

CLASSICAL: SCOTTISH ENSEMBLE: LOVE AND WAR IN BOHEMIA
Mezzo soprano Sophie Harmsen joins the Scottish Ensemble in Dvorak's enchanting Love Songs. Other Bohemian delights include Pavel Haas's Study for Strings (written while the composer was a Nazi prisoner in Theresienstadt) and Suk's Serenade for Strings. Biber's extraordinary Battalia and Handel arias complete this colourful programme.

FILM: SORCERER
A late addition to the Glasgow Film Festival programme, this digital restoration of William Friedkin's 1977 remake of The Wages of Fear has been overseen by the director himself and offers the first chance in ages for Friedkin freaks - I count myself as one - to see the film in something close to the quality he originally intended. Friedkin is a master of delivering nerve-shredding tension, and he gets the most out of an ingenious plot about four desperados forced to drive a truck full of nitroglycerin through the jungles of South America.
