FOUR Chinese people alleged to be in a gang that grew Â£1.3million of cannabis have been denied bail.
Li Guang Liu, 48, 30-yearold He Li, Yan Fang Cao, 29, and Liu Yiyan, 25, were arrested after being put under surveillance.
A policeman told Belfast Magistrates Court officers had found cannabis factories in Hughenden Avenue, North Belfast, and Greenville Street, East Belfast.
They also allegedly discovered the debris of a "cleaned out" factory in Evelyn Avenue, East Belfast.
The men were charged with cultivating and possessing cannabis, intent and conspiracy to supply it, and dishonestly diverting electricity between April 16 and May 1 this year.
Liu, Yiyan and Cao were arrested at Hughenden Avenue, while Li was arrested at home in Kinnegar Court, Holywood.
Police objected to bail on the grounds that the men, who immigration officials want to talk to, may abscond.
Denying bail, judge Harry McKibbin said he could not run the risk of the four leaving the country.
