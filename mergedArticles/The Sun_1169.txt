STUNNED cops discovered 112 people crammed in a house with one bathroom and no hot water. Many were shoeless and dressed only in underwear. Some were sitting on top of each other.
The 94 men, 16 women and two kids were found near Houston, Texas, US.
Most are thought to be illegal immigrants smuggled from Mexico. A police spokesman said: "All said they were hungry, thirsty and tired." Five men were arrested.
