THE son of an Ethiopian immigrant is following in the footsteps of David Cameron after winning a coveted place at Eton.
Ishak Ayiris will swap life on one of Britain's most impoverished council estates for the hallowed halls of the 15th century school, which has produced 19 prime ministers.
The 15-year-old has won a two-year scholarship, worth Â£76,000, and will study A-level politics, philosophy and economics at Eton from September.
He attends Forest Gate Community School, in Newham, east London, where he is supported by the 'pupil premium' payment, which gives financial support to hard-up families. Ishak, who will board at the school in Windsor, Berkshire, said: Leaving will be hard for my family not so much for me. Windsor is much quieter than Newham. Newham is loud, vibrant.' Ishak says he hopes to study at Oxford and plans to enter politics to help people from poorer areas.
'Drugs and crime have a big impact on our community in Newham,' he said. 'I see Newham as my home I want to live here for the rest of my life.
'I want to get the best education I can and come back and improve it.'
