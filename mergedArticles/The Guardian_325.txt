Sometimes described as the biggest company you've never heard of, Serco was celebrating a year ago, with profits surging after it had won a record number of contracts ranging from community healthcare in Suffolk to retaining the joint running of Britain's nuclear warheads store at Aldermaston. But everything changed for the conglomerate when it became mired in a series of scandals, saw its stock market value slump and was ejected from the FTSE 100 index.
Nevertheless, it still employs 120,000 people in more than 30 countries, and, once you start looking, you will see its logo everywhere. In Britain the group runs a range of government and other services, from rail franchises to immigration removal centres and prisons.
It has won a number of healthcare contracts as private involvement in the NHS increases, such as out-of-hours GPs in Cornwall. It looks after school inspections in the Midlands and east of England and in London it runs the Boris bikes cycle hire scheme.
