With one year before the general election, Telegraph writers make their predictions about the next government
Fraser Nelson
Who will be Prime Minister – and why?
Right now, Ed Miliband is looking more likely. Not because he’s a genius, but because the odds are stacked so heavily in Labour’s favour. It’s very close, and this could change. But the election is his to lose.
What will be their majority?
I’d guess less than 30.
Who will be the star of the campaign?
A voter, perhaps an old lady in a shopping mall who clearly, and succinctly, explains to Miliband why his policies would be a calamity for Britain.
What will be the big issues?
The economy, debt, cost of living. And inequality is fast coming up inside.
Any surprises?
Always. Election campaigns are defined by what goes wrong.
How will Ukip do?
The $3m question. I don’t have the foggiest, and don’t know anyone who claims to have the foggiest.
Will Boris be in Parliament?
Without a doubt. It’s a staging post. He’s a US citizen, so the Senate will be his next stop.
Janet Daley
Who will be Prime Minister – and why?
David Cameron, because he looks, and sounds, like a Prime Minister, even if what he says isn’t what you want to hear – unlike Ed Miliband who can’t even do a plausible impersonation of a Leader of the Opposition and is encumbered with Ed Balls.
What will be their majority?
Between 4 and 10 seats.
Who will be the star of the campaign?
Probably Cameron himself if he pulls out some hidden resources and a convincing sense of mission. This could be the secret campaign theme: Cameron as you’ve never seen him before. To compete for stardom with Boris, he has to play “The Serious One” versus “The Entertaining One”.
What will be the big issues?
Economic recovery, tax – especially for the middle class – and immigration.
Any surprises?
By definition, this is impossible to predict.
How will Ukip do?
Certainly better than the Lib Dems as a proportion of the national vote, but still no seats.
Dan Hodges 
Who will be Prime Minister – and why?
David Cameron. He’s failed to complete his modernisation of the Tory brand, but he’s got most of the big decisions – especially on the economy – right. And he is not Ed Miliband.
What will be their majority?
Tories. By 20 to 30 seats. Labour’s disastrous 35 per cent strategy means it’s virtually impossible for them to win now.
Who will be the star of the campaign?
Some housewife from Tyne and Wear who will harangue one of the party leaders over the price of Brussels sprouts.
What will be the big issues?
There will be three main issues. The economy. The economy. And the economy.
Any surprises?
Quite a few people will be surprised at the Tories winning. Many of them Tory MPs.
How will Ukip do?
Very badly – 5 to 6 per cent and no seats. I’ve pledged to streak naked down Whitehall if Nigel Farage breaks 6 per cent, which is the final nail in Ukip’s coffin.
Mary Riddell 
Who will be Prime Minister – and why?
Ed Miliband. Because he’ll have put together an offer that convinces richer people that he’ll improve society and poorer people that they will be the beneficiaries.
What will be their majority?
The days of landslides are over, but I forecast a workable overall majority, with 347 Labour seats.
Who will be the star of the campaign?
Hopefully, inspiring people from outside the mould. Rob Halfon, the Tory MP for Harlow, who champions blue-collar workers or Sophy Gardner, Labour’s candidate in Gloucester, a past RAF wing commander who served in Iraq and Afghanistan
What will be the big issues?
The economy, living standards, housing, the NHS, immigration – and Europe as a sub-strand.
Any surprises?
Nick Clegg looks vulnerable in Sheffield.
How will Ukip do?
Much less well than Nigel Farage might think. I’d say they’ll get less than 10 per cent of the vote – though Farage may get a seat.
Matthew d'Ancona
Who will be Prime Minister – and why?
David Cameron, because his record is sufficiently strong, Ukip will have peaked and Ed Miliband, though much more impressive than I thought in 2010, is insufficiently prime ministerial in bearing.
What will be their majority?
Small and possibly non-existent – don’t rule out a coalition.
Who will be the star of the campaign?
Boris, if he stands as an MP (as he should).
What will be the big issues?
The economy, of course, but also the character of the recovery. Is it truly national or statistical and of little relevance to most people? Labour will try to tempt Cameron to go too far on immigration.
Any surprises?
Osborne will be deployed more than in 2010 as the face of resilience. There will be a row about the “race card” and at least one big drugs story. Tory splits over Europe will appear.
How will Ukip do?
Badly in their attempt to win seats. But they could hand plenty of marginals to Labour.
Sue Cameron
Who will be Prime Minister – and why?
Ed Miliband will be PM in a LibLab coalition. The Tories stand to be the largest party, but they will be cheated of an overall majority because unreformed constituency boundaries give Labour an inbuilt advantage. Even small-scale Ukip support will lose the Tories seats in some marginals. Left-leaning Lib Dem grass roots who hate being in coalition with the Tories may defect to Labour and won’t countenance another Tory/Lib Dem coalition. The voters will be nervous about a Miliband premiership, because of questions about his competence on the economy and because of his image. He’s beginning to sound not just nerdy, but unctuous.
What will be their majority?
No overall majority for one party.
Who will be the star of the campaign?
Boris, Nigel Farage and Tessa Jowell. Dame Tessa will be limbering up for the London mayoral elections. With her mixture of charm and steel, Labour would be mad not to give her a starring role. Boris is always a star and Nasty Nige could yet hold the ring, even if Ukip fails to win seats itself.
Charles Moore
Who will be Prime Minister – and why?
David Cameron, because, unlike in 2010, he has something to say. Labour does not.
What will be their majority?
If overall, very small. It will probably require a coalition.
Who will be the star of the campaign?
Nigel Farage, I suppose, because he is naughty and new.
What will be the big issues?
Is the return of prosperity real for most people? Will we have a referendum on the European Union?
Any surprises?
The very nature of surprises means by answering this it wouldn’t be surprising.
How will Ukip do?
I think they will do less well than in the European elections, but they will make an impression across the country both for Labour and the Conservatives.
Will Boris be in Parliament?
If he says no, you can assume that he will.
Jeremy Warner 
Who will be Prime Minister – and why?
David Cameron, because an improving economy will come to his rescue and voters don’t trust Ed Miliband to run the country.
What will be their majority?
Marginal at best. There would have to be a monumental turnaround in the polls for the Tories to win a big majority.
Who will be the star of the campaign?
Unlikely though it may seem, George Osborne, who may be a somewhat cold figure, but has earned considerable respect for his handling of the economy.
What will be the big issues?
The economy, inequality/living standards, immigration. Europe only an issue in so far as it affects the immigration debate. Otherwise it is irrelevant.
Any surprises?
Biggest upset would be caused by a “yes” vote in the Scottish referendum. Cameron would feel obliged to resign, significant economic uncertainties would be created and it would raise big questions about the length of the next parliament.
