EDUCATION secretary Mike Russell took the referendum debate 12,000 miles away and told New Zealanders an independent Scotland would be easier for them to visit and study.
Speaking in Christchurch, ahead of an international education conference, Mr Russell MSP said the UK's immigration rules were very difficult for people to work their way through and the Scottish government wanted to have a much more open view.
"There has been a lot of difficulty with the visa system and we want to encourage more people, particularly post-graduates, to come to study in Scotland," he said.
Mr Russell is leading a UK delegation to the International Summit on the Teaching Profession organised by the Organisation for Economic and Education International in Wellington.
The annual summit brings together education ministers and national teacher union leaders from 13 countries, including the US.
Mr Russell also said he was supporting Dunedin's bid to gain Unesco City of Literature status, which Edinburgh already enjoys.
A spokesman for the Better Together campaign said: "It seems Mike Russell would rather travel the world talking up separation than face up to the concerns of student groups about the consequences of leaving the UK on Scotland's young people."
