A friend on Facebook just shared the following poster that says something shocking about Ukip's position on animal rights:
I posted it on Twitter and someone else sent me a link showing that it's true . Six out of the 14 votes in the European parliament against combating the illegal ivory trade came from Ukip – including Nigel Farage. This is morally repugnant. Perhaps they voted that way because they oppose forcing Western cultural values on African countries, but I doubt it.
Expect Ukip to explain that they always vote against anything that expands EU power. As a passionate anti-EU conservative, I appreciate that stance. But when it comes to taking action against something as squalid as the ivory trade, even this rabid patriot would compromise my anti-EU principles. What next? Refusing to uphold a ban on child labour?
A great number of Ukip supporters are troubled about immigration and want to protect British sovereignty. But they're not barbarians. The ivory trade represents the callous exploitation of innocent creatures for profit and every sane, civilised person opposes it. Given the Right's traditional loathing of horse meat and love of donkey sanctuaries, I think this could lose Ukip a few votes in May. Seriously, it's not cool and – for once when it comes to Ukip – definitely not funny.
