CLAIMS that charging migrants £200 each to use the NHS will put them at risk were blasted yesterday.
A group of public health experts says the new Immigration Bill targets a "vulnerable and easily scape-goated group".
But a Conservative spokesman hit back and said: "The UK has a national health service, not an international one.
"These proposals clamp down on those who abuse our public services and ensure migrants make a fair contribution to their cost."
Writing in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine today, the group says Britain profits from "health tourism". The Department for Health denied this allegation last night.
They also accuse the Tories of a politically-motivated crackdown to look tough on immigration.
The Bill calls for temporary migrants and foreign students to pay a charge in case they use the NHS. It could net £200million a year.
Tory MP Douglas Carswell said that he blamed previous governments for failing to police Britain's borders properly.
