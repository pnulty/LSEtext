Displaced workers
Low–skilled British workers have been forced out of jobs by migrant labour during the recession, an official government report has concluded.
The study is expected to give Conservative efforts to tighten immigration rules more weight in the face of opposition from Liberal Democrat colleagues and form a cornerstone of the Government's ongoing argument with the European Commission over the need to reform EU rules governing "free movement".
The 80–page Home Office study said there was "relatively little evidence" that migration caused British workers to be "displaced" from jobs during a "buoyant" market. But it added: "There is evidence of some labour market displacement, particularly by non–EU migrants in recent years when the economy was in recession.
"Where displacement effects are observed, these tend to be concentrated on lower skilled natives."
However, the report's findings could already be out of date as the authors admitted that they could not give a full picture of the impact of immigration on the job market because they had not considered some "major changes", such as the EU accession of Poland and seven other eastern European countries in 2004.
