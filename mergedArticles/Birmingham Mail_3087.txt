Tax money is spent unfairly HERE we go again, Syd Vaughan having another go at the Tory Government.
There's a programme on TV called How To Get A Council House.
Part of it features a 17-year-old Romanian girl who had a baby at 17 and, as a consequence of her actions, gets a package of benefits which amounts to four times the average government pension paid out to all those in their sixties onwards who have worked non-stop for more than forty years.
Rather than blaming one government in particular, shouldn't Mr Vaughan be blaming the useless liberal minded MPs of all parties, particularly his beloved Labour Party, for the mess they have made in allowing uncontrolled immigration into this country? In the programme a large proportion of the people looking for somewhere to live originate from other countries. How fair is it that economic scroungers are allowed to come here and siphon off money that should be paid out to the likes of Mr Vaughan, myself and others, who have paid their full wack into the economy and deserve a decent pension?
