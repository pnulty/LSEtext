The number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK has dropped over the last few months, despite the lifting of employment restrictions in the New Year.
The surge of immigrants predicted by some has yet to materialise, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) yesterday.
A total of 140,000 citizens from the two eastern European countries were employed in the UK between January and March, the ONS said, a drop of 4,000 when compared with the 144,000 employed in the last three months of 2013.
Despite the fall in recent months, the statistics showed that there was a rise of 25 per cent when the 140,000 currently employed was compared with the 112,000 Romanians and Bulgarians working this time last year.
Warnings of an influx of immigrants from the so-called A2 countries had been triggered by the relaxation of temporary curbs imposed on the nations when they joined the EU in 2007.
Until they were lifted on 1 January this year, the curbs meant that Romanians and Bulgarians had to seek a work permit.
In the run-up to the lifting of the restrictions, estimates of the Romanian and Bulgarian influx differed wildly.
At the top end of the scale was a prediction by the American think-tank The Democracy Institute which suggested that 385,000 people will migrate from Romania and Bulgaria to the UK over the next five years.
The pressure group Migration Watch, which has deep concerns about the scale of immigration into the UK, suggested 50,000 people per year. A more conservative estimate was provided by a UK government report, which, in 2010, forecast that 8,000 Romanians would come to Britain in 2014.
The forecasts were accompanied by predictions of an increase in pickpocketing, mugging, beggars on the streets and rioting.
At the turn of the year, claims of fully booked flights and coaches from Bucharest and Sofia proved incorrect.
Yesterday, Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: "These figures are unsurprising. The committee viewed for itself how the supposed flood of immigration from Romania and Bulgaria was little more than a trickle. It would appear now that many may have actually left the UK.
"By not understanding the likely levels of immigration, we risk increasing the poisonous rhetoric and prejudice which leads to the destruction of all rational debate. We must not have an immigration arms race."
SNP European election candidate Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh said: "It is evidence like this which shows the absolute folly of the Westminster parties pandering to Ukip on immigration."
Migration experts urged caution when approaching yesterday's figures, arguing it was "too early" to know the long-term implications of lifting the restrictions.
