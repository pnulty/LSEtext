Tigher immigration rules could severely handicap Britain’s food industry, the head of the National Farmers’ Union has warned.
The prospect of Britain’s farmers not being able to staff their harvests is of real concern, Peter Kendall, NFU president, cautioned.
Mr Kendall, whose eight years in the role will end at the union’s annual conference next week, gave the warning in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph.
“We wouldn’t harvest our fruit and vegetables without migrant workers," he said.
“We don’t want farming to get massively disadvantaged in the debate about immigration."
Mr Kendall also believes that the recent floods show that governmental attitudes still tend towards regarding farmland as an environmental feature.
“For me, the pendulum has swung too far to 'environment first’ and farming not being important," he said. “I’m not saying farmland shouldn’t act as a buffer, but what it shouldn’t do is act as water storage and be undervalued."
Mr Kendall believes that, as it stands today, the bad weather will not have anywhere near as bad an impact on UK agricultural harvests as the wet autumn of 2012. That saw wheat planting fall 30pc, delivering a 2013 harvest of 12m tonnes – the lowest since 1978 and well down on the recent average of 16m tonnes.
“Yes, there’s a lot of flooding around at the moment," he said, “but in terms of gross output, I don’t think it will have an impact similar to those."
