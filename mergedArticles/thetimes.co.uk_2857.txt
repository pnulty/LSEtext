Gary Shteyngart was coached in self-sabotage as a kid in Brooklyn by his Jewish Russian immigrant mother who, inventively hybridising English and Russian, called him “Failurchka” — Little Failure. Ever since, as a hyped-up humorous novelist and Manhattan-dysfunctional New Yorker writer getting by in the world, he has learnt to beat his rivals and those he has offended by parodying them in fiction by whacking himself first. And a lot of people, including his own parents, have been waiting in line to pop him one. A memoir “full of dysfunction and hammer-armed assassins”, he says, “needs an adult in the room”. Someone to tell the hero that he has to change: a psychoanalyst. Then Shteyngart writes his successful first novel, The Russian Debutante’s Handbookand later writes this memoir as a belated love letter to himself.
