NIGEL Farage yesterday rejected claims that his comments about foreign languages were "racist".
He was quizzed after saying he was uncomfortable hearing passengers on a London train speaking foreign languages.
LBC radio host James O'Brien asked if he felt the same when his German wife and his bilingual children spoke her language.
The Ukip leader retorted: "No, because they can speak English." He said at some East London schools a majority of pupils did not speak English.
"Doesn't that say to us that what we want is a sensible balanced immigration policy?" He said he was trying to make the "simple point" that being in the EU made that impossible. "What is racism? Is race about race or is it about nationality? I made a comment that wasn't intended to say any more than that I felt uncomfortable about the rate and pace of change."
Prime Minister David Cameron called Mr Farage's words "the politics of anger". Ukip slogans "sound appealing but there's nothing behind it," he said.
