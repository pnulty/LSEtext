She recently confirmed she will be leaving her co-hosting job on the entertainment show, Extra.
And Maria Menounos is clearly making sure that she goes out with a bang as she spends her final days working alongside co-host Mario Lopez.
The 35-year-old showcased her svelte figure in a clinging black minidress in Los Angeles on Wednesday afternoon.
Going for the always popular sartorial option, Maria wowed in the chic long-sleeved dress which clung to her slender frame.
Paired with a classic pair of nude heels, the brunette beauty added some glamour to the outfit with her perfectly tousled locks.
Keeping her look simple with minimal jewellery, Maria let her beauty take centre stage with fresh-faced make-up.
After working on the popular show since 2011, Maria has decided to willingly leave the show.
Reports had suggested the reason behind her decision was a rift between her and 40-year-old co-host Mario Lopez.
However, speaking to People, a source dismissed the claims: 'There's no Mario-Maria thing. She has no problem with him. She's fine with her co-host.'
The source added: 'She's exploring a few options right now. There was absolutely no drama.'
The former Dancing With The Stars contestant currently stars in her own reality show titled Chasing Maria Menounos.
The show features her boyfriend of more than 15 years, director and producer Kevin Undergaro and the Greek-American beauty's parents Costas and Litsa.
It gives a glimpse into her life in Los Angeles living with her boyfriend and her traditional Greek immigrant parents, who demand that she get married and have kids.
