IN the aftermath of the senseless murder of teacher Ann Maguire there is the need to look for lessons to be learned, for ways of ensuring that such a tragedy never happens again.
There is also the terrible fact that only last week new figures showed that since 2011 almost 1,000 children have been found carrying weapons in school, 80 of them from primary schools.
It is therefore understandable that there should be calls for the introduction of metal detectors at school gates. If these had been in place then Mrs Maguire would probably have been alive today, looking forward to her retirement after a dedicated career of 40 years.
But she – we learn from the head teacher at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds – would have opposed such a move.
The fact is that teachers work at some personal risk to themselves either from violent children or indeed their pupils’ parents.
What is to blame: a society that is inured to violence, a criminal justice system that is weak in its response to those who carry knives, or a lack of discipline in and respect for schools themselves?
Whatever the answer this terrible tragedy should make us take stock and reconsider what an important role is played by those to whom we daily entrust our children.

Migrants’ net contribution
ONE of the great debates over immigration centres around the issue of how much European migrants contribute to Britain in terms of how much tax they pay and how much they take from the system in benefits. 
Research from think tank Migration Watch has found that immigrants who work for the minimum wage make “virtually no net contribution” as they pay very little tax but receive a substantial amount in credits and benefits.
For instance 150,000 employees from Eastern Europe pay only about £1 a week in net tax while some pay nothing at all. Says Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch: “This analysis shows simply that the taxpayer is subsidising their wages.” Case closed.

Flash Harry on parade
PRINCE Harry’s Hugo Boss pants were briefly on display yesterday as he paid a visit to wounded troops at a training camp for those hoping to win a place in the British Armed Forces team for the Invictus Games for injured veterans. 
With his usual ease and humour he made a joke of it. 
No danger of Harry getting his knickers in a twist over a smalls wardrobe malfunction.
