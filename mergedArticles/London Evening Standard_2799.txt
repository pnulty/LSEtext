Ground: Immigration Kick-off: 9.30am As the economy booms, so does immigration. To the chagrin of the Home Secretary, today's figure of 212,000 net migrants (the highest number of incomers since 1964) dashed her claim to have slashed immigration. But might May bite back at Osborne, who as Chancellor has insisted that skilled people and execs must not be kept out? Both are rivals for the leadership. The immediate loser, however, is David Cameron: His promise to keep migrant numbers to the "tens of thousands" now looks a tad optimistic, to say the least. Score: May 0, Osborne 0
