Shock figures show the bill in 2012-2013 was over £102million - an increase of nearly 30 per cent in just two years.
Panicked Ministry of Justice officials last night blamed the rise on a sharp increase in the number of retired judges drawing pensions and longer life expectancy.
The figures come a day after the Sun told how a senior judge was forced to step down after admitting he was living with with an illegal immigrant.
Richard McKee, 65, was allowed to “retire" with a full pension.
Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan accused the Government of getting its priorities wrong.
Amounts spent on pensions
He said: “The public will find it hard to believe that more and more is being spent on judges’ pensions at a time when they are slashing spending on victims, police, prisons and probation."
But the Government insisted Labour had done nothing to cut the pensions bill when they were in power.
Judges benefited from a non-contributory final salary pension until the Coalition forced them to start putting aside part of their pay from 2012.
Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said this change had already saved the public money.
He said: “It is only since changes we made in 2012 that judges have had to make contributions to their own pensions.
“We are reforming the Judicial Pension Scheme in line with reform to other public service pension schemes."
He added: “Our judges are rightly held in high regard.
“But at a time when there is widespread economic reform across the public sector the judiciary cannot be immune."
