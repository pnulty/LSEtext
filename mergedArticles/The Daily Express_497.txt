IT has been revealed that, since 1995, immigration has cost Britain a staggering £148billion, or £5,600 per household. The figures show that the Left's claim that immigration benefits this country is simply untrue.
Uncontrolled immigration from the EU, and a failure to adequately regulate immigration from the rest of the world, is a clear recipe for disaster.
Politicians must recognise that they have to listen to the people. We have had enough of soaring immigration. It is damaging our public services, it is eroding our sense of community, and it has left us billions of pounds out of pocket.
It has to be stopped before it costs us even more.
