212,000 rise blow for PM
DAVID Cameron's pledge to slash immigration lay in tatters last night as figures revealed an influx of 212,000 foreigners into Britain.
The total is more than double the Prime Minister's target of 100,000 by the next General Election.
Statistics also showed 24,000 Romanians and Bulgarians flooded into the UK in just 12 months - nearly three times more than the year before.
Scott Blinder, director at the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said it was "extremely unlikely" the Government would hit its target.
The next set of figures could be even worse as details are not yet available for the numbers who came from the two countries on January 1 when EU work restrictions were lifted.
The Office for National Statistics said net migration - the difference between migrants leaving and arriving - soared from 154,000 to 212,000 in the year to September 2013.
Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: "These latest figures show just how out of control the Government is."
Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said ministers were determined to cut the "abuse of free movement".
