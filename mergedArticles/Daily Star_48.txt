Says..
SNP leader Alex Salmond likes to remind people of his background as an economist, but given his party's problems with figures maybe he should stop.
The latest to question his promises of wealth and security for all is pensions expert David Davison.
He says that to fund pensions for Scotland's ageing population, we would have to find room - and presumably jobs - for an extra million immigrants over the next 50 years.
Basically, there are not enough working Scots to guarantee that pension and welfare payments will match those in the rest of the UK - without spending cuts and tax rises.
This is not an anti-immigration issue, just more proof that without being part of the more robust UK economy, the prospects for pensioners in an independent Scotland are at best uncertain.
Anyone who accepts Mr Salmond's "assurances" on the matter is taking a terrible and unnecessary risk.
