David Cameron has confirmed the government will accept recommendations for a 3% rise in the minimum wage and has pledged to "restore its value" in the longer term. He said he agreed that a rise to pounds 6.50 should take place in October, in line with the advice of the Low Pay Commission, and after George Osborne said he ultimately wanted it to rise to pounds 7.
Speaking in Coventry yesterday, he said: "Restoring the value of the minimum wage is a vital part of how we secure a recovery for all, with economic security for every working family."
The prime minister rejected criticism of his public spending cuts by senior members of the church, including archbishop Vincent Nichols and many Church of England bishops.
He said it was wrong to let British taxpayers fund people to live a life "with no purpose, dependent on benefits" and to open the country's borders to rapid immigration. He said: "I don't care whether you are the leader of the Labour party or the leader of the church, this kind of failure is just wrong."
The prime minister also suggested he wanted to use future savings on public spending to fund tax cuts. He said "every efficiency" found could help provide "a bit of extra cash" for hard-pressed families.
"Too often we've given the impression that we're just about fixing problems rather than changing things for a purpose," he said. "It's all about values.
"And the most important value right now - after a difficult time for our country - is giving people a sense of economic security and peace of mind." Rowena Mason and agencies
