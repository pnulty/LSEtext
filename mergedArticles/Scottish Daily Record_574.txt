OUTRAGE MUM'S FURY OVER PHOTO Government's immigration website uses pic of girl they tried to deport
THE mother of a young girl saved from being kicked out of Scotland by a Daily Record campaign has spoken of her disgust after the youngster's picture was published on a Government website.
Francisca Canales, 28, was furious when she saw eightyear-old Millie's photograph on the Gov.UK website alongside an article about immigration appeals.
The picture of Millie and two friends was taken by a Record photographer when we highlighted moves to deport Francisca to Chile.
This would have meant Millie, then seven, having to go too - even though she has lived almost her whole life in Scotland and speaks no Spanish. Our campaign sparked an online petition which attracted support from all over the world, eventually forcing a UK Border Agency climbdown.
Francisca said: "I'm disgusted that after everything we have been through with the Home Office and Border Agency, they think they can put my daughter's picture on a website.
"It is all over Twitter, that's how I found out. They have put my family through hell."
Francisca was pregnant when threatened with deportation. Her son Caspian is now seven months old.
They live in Stirling with Caspian's dad Barry Nicol, 31, and Millie.
Stirling SNP MSP Bruce Crawford said:" I'm shocked that the Gov.UK website would use pictures of innocents in this way.
"I have written to Home Secretary Theresa May seeking an explanation." Last night the webpage was taken down after a flood of online complaints.
A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: "We are extremely sorry.
"The photograph should never have been used in this way."
