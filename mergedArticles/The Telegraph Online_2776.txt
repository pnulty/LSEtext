Net migration has risen to its highest point since 2011 in a blow to the Government’s pledge to cut levels to the “tens of thousands" by the next general election.
The surge was partly driven by a huge increase in the number of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens coming to Britain, which leaped 166 per cent from 9,000 to 24,000 year-on-year.
The Office for National Statistics said estimates for the 12 months to the end of September revealed a net flow of 212,000 migrants to Britain, compared with 154,000 the previous year.
It now seems highly unlikely that David Cameron, the Prime Minister, and Theresa May, the Home Secretary, will be able to meet the net migration pledge.
Of the Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants, seven out of 10 said they were coming here to workand the rest to study.
The number of National Insurance numbers given to foreigners - an important indicator of immigration levels - showed a 19 per cent rise to 617,000 in 2013.
There were huge surges in the number of citizens coming to Britain to work from European Union countries which have been hardest hit by the economic crisis .
Data showed the number of Italians registering rose 66 per cent to 44,000, with other countries showing other large increases including Portugal (up 47 per cent, up to 30,000 people) and Spain (up 36 per cent to just under 52,000).
Poland also saw a large rise with 39 per cent more coming here last year, 111,000 compared with 80,000 in 2012.
Twitter: David Barrett - Ministers pledged to cut net migration to "tens of thousands" by next election. That pledge is now unlikely - even impossible - to meet
Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU on January 1, 2007, and restructions which had limited their citizens' access to the UK job market were lifted at the start of this year.
Against a backdrop of growing concerns of an influx of Romanians and Bulgarians to the UK, and a surge in popularity for the UK Independence Party, the Prime Minister last year unveiled a series of tough measures designed to clamp down on abuse of free movement between EU member states.
James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, highlighted aspects of the ONS figures which showed fewer people from outside the EU came to Britain last year.
"Our reforms have cut non-EU migration to its lowest level since 1998 and there are now 82,000 fewer people arriving annually from outside the EU than when this government came to power," he said.
"And overall figures are also well down from when we first came to government in 2010 - with nearly 70,000 fewer migrants coming to the UK.
"Numbers are down across the board in areas where we can control immigration, but arrivals from the EU have doubled in the last year.
"The Government is ensuring that our controls on accessing benefits and services, including the NHS and social housing, are among the tightest in Europe."
He added: "We cannot impose formal immigration controls on EU migrants, so we are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and seeking to address the factors that drive European immigration to Britain.
"We are building an immigration system that is fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants, that is tough on those who abuse the system or flout the law, and that ensures people come to the UK for the right reasons - to work hard and contribute to our economy and society."
