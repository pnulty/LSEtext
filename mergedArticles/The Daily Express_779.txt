A WOMAN tried to smuggle four illegal immigrants into Britain in a VW camper van after being told it would clear her cocaine debts.
Mother-of-one Crystal Mosley, 27, agreed to take part in the peoplesmuggling racket with lover Daniel Hassard after gangmasters told her the £3,000 reward for trafficking would clear their drugs "slate".
But the couple were caught as they waited to board a cross channel ferry near Calais, a court was told.
Border Control officials searched their rented camper van and found three immigrants from Vietnam and one from China hiding in the back.
Canterbury Crown Court heard that Mosley owed money to drug dealers but the couple had both lost their jobs shortly before making the trip.
Mosley who was driving the vehicle, feigned shock, telling officials: "I didn't know they were there." But she later admitted taking part in the racket, saying she and 25-year-old Hassard had been offered between £2,000 and £3,000 for the delivery.
Yesterday Mosley and Hassard, both from Marton, near Blackpool, Lancs, admitted people-smuggling.
Painter and decorator Hassard was jailed for 15 months after admitting the operation was "his idea". Mosley was also given 15 months but the sentence was suspended for two years so she could care for her nine-year-old son. She must also abide by a 7pm to 7am curfew for four months.
