The decision to drop the question has caused outrage with BBC bosses accused of allowing censorship.
The scheduled question, 'When will it be accepted to be Muslim and gay?',' was dropped from the debate after concerns from mosque officials.
conce mo offi cNs Mosque chairman Dr Naseem, said: "The impression given was that BBC3 wanted to discuss immigration so that's what we were looking out imgtwanted Naseem for"All the members of the committee there on that day were then informed 20 minutes before the programme started that they wanted to discuss homosexuality."
The makers of the programme Mentorn Media claimed "no concerns were raised" when the mosque was asked if there were any subjects off limits.
Dr Naseem added: "If it was said that nothing was off limits, it was in the context of immigration."
