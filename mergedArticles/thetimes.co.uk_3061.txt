Set in East London’s Polish community, Anya Lipska’s second novel, Death Can’t Take a Joke, has a clever plot, interesting characters and believable knowledge of the edgy lives led by immigrants half-pining for their old country. Janusz Kiszka is a slightly shady fixer and unofficial private detective, Natalie Kershaw a young DC just transferred to the Murder Squad and about to move in with her boyfriend. Murders and unexplained deaths merge, so that the two almost-friends find themselves co-operating to solve crimes with a Polish tinge.
