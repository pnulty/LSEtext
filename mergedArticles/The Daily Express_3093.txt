A STAR of the UK Independence Party's latest election broadcast was suspended last night for expressing "repellent" racist views.
Andre Lampitt was featured raising concerns about immigration from eastern Europe as part of the anti-Brussels party campaign for next month's European elections.
But it emerged yesterday that he had posted a series of shocking messages on the internet, including a suggestion that Islam was "evil".
He also claimed that Labour leader Ed Miliband was "not British" and called for Africans to "kill themselves off".
After the Twitter messages came to light, Ukip officials announced that Mr Lampitt's party membership was being suspended.
A party spokesman said: "We are deeply shocked that Mr Lampitt has expressed such repellent views.
"His membership of the party has been suspended immediately pending a full disciplinary process."
Mr Lampitt, who described himself as "born British in Rhodesia" was filmed on a building site in the broadcast shown on Tuesday.
He was wearing a hard hat and a T-shirt bearing the logo of his home renovation, carpentry and electricals firm.
In the clip, he complained that EU migrants were undercutting the wages of British workers.
He said: "Since the lads from eastern Europe are prepared to work for a lot less than anybody else, I've found it a real struggle."
However, Mr Lampitt also said on Twitter: "I believe in being British. It is earned through generations of existence not through birth."
Another message read: "I was born and grew up in Africa. Please leave Africa for the Africans. Let them kill themselves off."
Last night the Twitter account appeared to have been deleted.
