MORE than 100 colleges and universities could be stripped of the right to bring in lucrative foreign students as part of a crackdown.
Immigration minister James Brokenshire wants to toughen up rules which allows higher education institutions to admit overseas students even if they cannot prove they are genuine.
Critics say the sector has been guilty of 'selling immigration' to people who have no intention of studying in the UK and want to work. Mr Brokenshire said: 'I'm sorry, but is it really unreasonable to require universities to ensure students are genuine?
'After all, they would hardly admit a British student without checking their A-Level results.
Under existing rules colleges keep their 'trusted status' even if one in five of students is rejected by the Home Office. But Mr Brokenshire said the margin was 'extremely generous'.
