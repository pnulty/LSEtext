I generally agree with Will Hutton, but selling visas to rich immigrants is profoundly immoral ("What's wrong with selling visas to rich immigrants at pounds 2.5m a pop?", Comment, last week. As Michael Sandel points out in his thought-provoking book, Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?, selling the right to gain citizenship to rich immigrants perpetuates the growing divide between rich and poor, and conveys the message that the rich are special and deserve precedence over the poor. It was ironic that Will Hutton's article was alongside a piece by Nick Cohen describing how a US equity group is seeking to deny union rights to Boots pharmacists, another example of the march towards inequality.
