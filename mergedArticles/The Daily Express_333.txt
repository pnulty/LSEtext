THE UK's "toothless" immigration system was exposed yesterday after a Kenyan woman ordered to leave the UK five years ago stayed on to fiddle £26,000 in benefits.
Incredibly, following her arrest over the scam, mother-of-one Lucy Mbugua, 40, was granted permission to remain here after claiming the right to family life.
Warrant Birmingham magistrates found Mbugua, from Selly Oak, Birmingham, guilty in her absence last month of fraudulently claiming £26,308 in benefits between 2009 and 2013.
She also failed to turn up for sentence last Friday and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
Tory MP Peter Bone said: "This illustrates just how toothless our immigration system is. There are thousands like this woman."
A Home Office spokesman last night refused to explain how Mbugua was able to stay on in the UK after 2009.
