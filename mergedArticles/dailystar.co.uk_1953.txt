AIRLINE passengers are facing major disruption after an IT glitch resulted in extended queues at immigration desks.
Lengthy queues have already started forming at airport terminals across the country after a fault on UK Border Force computers this afternoon.
Extra staff have been drafted in to try and reduce the queues.
A Government spokesman said: "We are currently experiencing temporary IT problems which may add to the time taken to conduct passport checks.
"We are working to rectify this issue and are providing extra staff to get passengers through the controls as quickly as possible. Our priority remains security of the border.
"We apologise for any additional time this adds to passengers' journeys."
A Government spokesman
Passengers across the country have already reported problems at passport control desks, mostly affecting those trying to enter the country.
The problem is having a particular impact on non-EU airline customers.
A Heathrow spokesman said: "There are some longer queues than normal in the terminals, but we have spoken to border force and they are putting on extra staff.
"Obviously we want to sort the issue out but not risk the integrity of the border controls."
A Birmingham Airport spokesman said: "We are aware and the impact it is having at the moment.
"It appears to be getting progressively worse but we are hoping it will be sorted out soon."
A Gatwick spokesman added: "We are experiencing similar to the rest of the airports, and we are working to get people through.
"People should be able to get off the plane, it is those coming through the immigration process which it is frustrating."
The spokesman said there should not be any delays to flights leaving UK airports.
