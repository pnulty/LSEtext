JUDGE Richard Bray's philosophy has been "always to do justice without fear or favour".
He applied that rule whether he was jailing a cowboy builder for six years, dealing with a famous footballer, or defying a Home Secretary.
In 2012 he sentenced the former Norwich City striker Leon McKenzie to six months in jail for sending bogus letters to the police in a bid to avoid a driving ban.
In 2007 he defied then Home Secretary John Reid's plea for judges to help cut prison numbers saying he would not stop passing "proper sentences".
Jailing two men for a year each for fighting, he said: "I am well aware there is overcrowding in the prisons and detention centres.
"That is not going to prevent me from passing proper sentences in each case. The reason our prisons are full to overcrowding is because judges can no longer pass deterrent sentences.
"Until politicians wake up to this fact, criminals will continue to reâ€“offend and the prison population will continue to rise."
In February he attacked our "leaking sieve" borders during the case of Albanian illegal immigrant drug dealer Baksim Bushati, 37, who was deported three times only to return to offend again.
He said the UK's border agencies were powerless, adding: "Our defences to illegal immigrants are leaking like a sieve."
In 2010 the judge slammed "pitifully inadequate" immigration controls when he sentenced a Vietnamese human trafficker, Hanh Van Vu, who had "married" his sister to stay in Britain.
As he jailed him for 11 years, he told Vu that he and his sister faced deportation, adding: "I will do my duty. I can only hope the Home Office will do theirs."
