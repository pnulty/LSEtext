From Mr Robbie Gibbons.
Sir, Professor Colin Mason's warning - that Scotland is at risk of decreased attractiveness as a corporate hub because of uncertainty over independence - has arguably come 30 years too late. Much of his feared decline has already occurred in recent decades ("Scotland's uncomfortable parallel with Quebec", Letters, April 22).
In that period Scotland has seen a drain of corporate headquarters and leadership roles to London as once Scottish-headquartered firms such as Direct Line, Scottish Life, Scottish Widows and Bank of Scotland have been acquired and are now wholly or effectively controlled from the south of England. Even companies that were almost entirely Scottish in their operations have moved: witness the loss of Distillers, which was acquired by Guinness in 1986, and Britoil. One might argue that an independent Scotland would have stood a greater chance of retaining those HQs and associated high-value jobs by possessing full control of tax, regulation, immigration and international trade negotiation policy.
Of course, one might also reply to Prof Mason in a simpler fashion: the most effective way to avoid damaging ongoing uncertainty is for an emphatic Yes vote to be recorded in the independence referendum.
