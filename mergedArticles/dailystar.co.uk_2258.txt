PRINCE CHARLES has reportedly likened Russian President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler over his actions in Ukraine while on tour in Canada.
The Prince of Wales is said to have made the comment while speaking to a woman who fled the Nazis and who had family members who were killed in the Holocaust.
The next in line to the throne allegedly made the comments to Marienne Ferguson, a volunteer at the Museum of Immigration in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Ms Ferguson told the Prince she fled to Canada with her family in 1939, shortly before Germany annexed the Baltic city of Gdansk.
After meeting Charles Ms Ferguson, 78, said: "The Prince said 'And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler'.

"I must say that I agree with him and am sure a lot of people do.
"But I was very surprised that he made the comment as I know they [members of the Royal Family] aren't meant to say these things.
"I told the Prince that while my family and I were lucky to get a permit to travel, many members of my relatives had permits but were unable to get out before the war broke out on September 1.
"They were sent to the concentration camps and died."
Labour MP Mike Gapes, who represents Ilford South, condemned the Prince's comments.
He said on Twitter: "If Prince Charles wants to make controversial statements on national or international issues he should abdicate and stand for election.
"In constitutional monarchy policy and diplomacy should be conducted by parliament and government. Monarchy should be seen and not heard."
A spokesman for Clarence House said: "We do not comment on private conversations."
Charles is due to meet with President Putin next month when the pair attend the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy.
