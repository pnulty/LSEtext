A REPORT released today by the Commission on the Future of Health and Social Care is another craven attempt to take money from Britain’s pensioners.
The commission, established by the King’s Fund charity, said that “all pensioners are no longer poor pensioners”. 
They want the introduction of universal charges that would also hit the elderly including billing for hospital stays and doctors’ appointments. 
Other measures put forward include an end to free bus passes, free prescriptions and free TV licences.
Let us hope these ideas are never implemented. 
Pensioners have contributed to the system their whole lives and deserve free and easy access to all of the services that they need.
Charging anybody, let alone some of the most vulnerable and deserving people in society, for use of the health service is a betrayal of the NHS and a betrayal of them.
There are “hard choices” to be made, but these recommendations are not the right ones.
Britain’s elderly are increasingly seen as a soft target for those who want to cut public spending.
Imposing misery on millions of pensioners is a harmful and immoral way of trying to balance the books.

Migrants burdening state
DURING the past decade the number of EU immigrants claiming benefits in the UK has rocketed by 150 per cent to 121,280. 
The effects of the EU’s aggressive expansion policy are clear to see, the biggest single group of migrants claiming benefits were the 26,500 unemployed Poles picking up state handouts paid for by taxpayers.
This is madness. As Leo McKinstry points out on this page the vast number of migrants allowed to waltz into this country courtesy of the EU’s open door policy has placed “an unsustainable burden on our civic infrastructure”. 
As well as the direct costs to the Government of paying out benefits and providing public services – which we, as taxpayers, ultimately pay for – immigration has depressed wages and increased unemployment.
This country needs to be freed from Brussels and free to reverse the shocking rise in immigration.

With the sun, the smog
BRITISH weather is often cause for pessimism. 
Britons are now mostly resigned to spending the majority of the year being rained on and look forward to any rays of sunshine that can be glimpsed through the clouds.
Tragically it turns out that even sunshine now counts as bad weather because the calm conditions have combined with dust from North Africa and toxic gases to create a dangerous smog. 
Just our luck.
