THE United Kingdom now has the fourth largest foreign-born population in the world with 7.4 million immigrants making up 12 per cent of inhabitants.
A report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development shows that numbers soared by a half during the first decade of the 21st century, meaning that only the US, Russia and Germany now have higher numbers of migrants.
The study also showed that Britain is on course to become one of only a handful of countries in the world where birth rates are increasing with an average British woman projected to have 1.97 children.
The OECD reported that 321,000 new arivals came to Britain in 2011.
