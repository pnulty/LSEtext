JOBLESS European migrants cost British taxpayers £10million a year in rent, Government figures show.
An estimated 3,000 unemployed immigrants arrive each year to claim housing benefit of about £100 a week, analysis suggests. More than half get it for six months while almost a third claim the benefit for more than a year.
The Department for Work and Pensions figures are the first official estimate of the scale of "benefit tourism" and come after a new law this month banned future migrants from claiming housing benefit unless they have already found work.
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: "It's not fair that migrants were able to receive housing benefit without having first made a contribution to the country."
Last week the Office for National Statistics said 350,000 more eastern Europe migrants arrived here in the past decade than previously thought.
