BORDER posts may have to be introduced on the British mainland if Scotland votes to go it alone in September's referendum, MPs say.
The warning comes as analysts at Exane BNP Paribas claim Scotland will need a large influx of immigration to balance its ageing population and cover its pension payouts.
The SNP says checks will not be needed but MPs close to the border said passport controls will be required if thousands of immigrants head to Scotland.
Michael Moore, for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: "You either have similar immigration policies, or border controls."
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael meanwhile promised to give Scotland more powers if it votes to remain in the UK.
