HARD-UP taxpayers have shelled out £140billion on migrants since 1995, a bombshell report reveals.
It means Brits have been forking out £22million every single day on them for the past 17 years.
The study said that what immigrants pay into the system is dwarfed by what they receive in handouts.
Migration Watch findings rubbished claims from a recent university report that said immigrants had benefited Britain financially.
Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: "Our report finally disposes of the immigration lobby's oft-repeated claims that immigration reduces our tax burden. The total cost is high and increased dramatically between 1995 and 2011.
"It has provided no compensation for the overcrowding of this island."
