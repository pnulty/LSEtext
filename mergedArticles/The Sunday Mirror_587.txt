IT is incredible to think that Maria Miller, the Culture Secretary, can still be in her job after how she has behaved.
But perhaps it isn't so unlikely when you consider that, as an MP, special rules seem to apply to her.
Just as they seem to do to Mark Menzies, who resigned as a ministerial aide after the Sunday Mirror exposed his involvement with a Brazilian male prostitute.
This Government acts with unbending harshness towards ordinary people but lets MPs get away with just about anything.
There are unprecedented numbers of immigrants being refused entry to this country with people who employ those who have got in illegally facing big fines. Yet Rogerio Santos insists Mr Menzies was involved with him despite knowing he was not supposed to be in the UK. Mr Menzies claims he was unaware of Mr Santos' residency status. But as an MP he should have made it his business to find out.
As for Maria Miller, she has ripped off the taxpayer, cheated the system, hindered an inquiry into her expenses and threatened not just the journalists working on her story but the whole newspaper industry.
Her only punishment, if it can be called that, has been to pay back a fraction of the amount she claimed and deliver a 34-second apology.
Meanwhile tens of thousands of people struggling to survive after huge cuts were inflicted on their welfare payments, including the hated Bedroom Tax, are left to suffer. Many are prosecuted and sometimes imprisoned if they try to get round the rules.
No wonder the British people are contemptuous of politicians who not only crush the most vulnerable but cream off all they can for themselves and lash out when criticised for it. Just as in Victorian times, it's one law for them and another for the rest of us.
