THE Labour Party has urged the Government to investigate the way outsourcing company Serco runs an immigration detention centre, after allegations of sexual assaults at the unit.
The calls by the Opposition are based on media reports that Serco failed to investigate properly an allegation that one of its staff repeatedly assaulted a female resident at the Yarl's Wood holding centre near Clapham in Bedfordshire, which is used mainly to house women facing deportation.
Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, reportedly plans to summon senior Serco executives to Parliament next month to discuss the issue.
However, a statement from Serco said the sexual assault claims at Yarl's Wood had been investigated and there was no case to answer. Norman Abusin, director at the centre, said: "All parties concluded that the allegations made against our employee were false and no criminal charges were brought."
Serco is trying to restore its reputation after a series of scandals over contracts.
Last December, Serco and G4S were stripped of the responsibility for tagging criminals after being found to have overcharged the Government by tens of millions of pounds.
