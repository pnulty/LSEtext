IT has always been a disgrace that so many foreign criminals dodge deportation because of their "right to a family life".
We now know that a judge who let 11 of them stay was privately helping support a Nigerian woman 26 years his junior who was here illegally.
We can only speculate whether Richard McKee's view of the immigration cases on which he ruled was skewed by his personal life.
What's equally troubling is that he has been allowed quietly to retire on a full £50,000-a-year pension.
That's it. It's just chalked up to experience. One of those things.
Well, that's not good enough.
Britain deserves answers over this judge's conduct.
And the Home Office should demand those 11 recent cases be re-examined.
