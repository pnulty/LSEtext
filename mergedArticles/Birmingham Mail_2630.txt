I AM now in my 70s and have voted in every general election since I was 18, but as the 2015 election approaches I can say with honesty that I don't know who to vote for any more.
The old adage 'you can fool people some of the time, but you cannot fool people all of the time' could never be more apt.
The two main parties have made promises in their manifestos in order to secure our votes and then, when in power, have blatantly time and time again not carried them out. The vast majority of voters are now becoming apathetic as was proved recently in a by-election when around 75 per cent of voters failed to cast a vote.
Speak to the people of this country and they will say the major concerns are to stop immigration, restore law and order, get to grips with the NHS and stop giving billions of our money to overseas aid. Start getting these wrongs right and only then will the electorate's faith be restored.
