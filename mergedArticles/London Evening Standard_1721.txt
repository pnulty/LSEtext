SENIOR judges were criticised today after ruling that an illegal immigrant who murdered a schoolboy less than a year after arriving in Britain cannot be deported because he is gay.
The Court of Appeal said that sending him back to Jamaica would violate the 29-year-old's human rights.
The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons and was referred to as JR, was "party to murder" at the age of 16 when he and another schoolboy stabbed to death 15-year-old Abdul Maye over a Â£10 debt outside Little Ilford comprehensive school in Manor Park in 2001.
He was detained at Her Majesty's pleasure in September 2002 and was released in June 2012. Since then, Home Secretary Theresa May has been battling to deport him.
But JR, who has an IQ of 63, successfully appealed against her decision when the First-Tier Tribunal accepted that he was gay and would be at risk of "inhuman or degrading treatment" if returned to Jamaica.
Last year, the Upper Tribunal refused a challenge by Mrs May after JR's mother said she "knew all along" that her son was gay.
Now Lord Justice Kay, sitting with Lord Justice Lewison and Sir Stanley Burnton at the Court of Appeal, has blocked the Government's latest attempt to have JR deported.
Nick de Bois, Conservative MP for Enfield North, said: "I have no doubt that the British public would back the Home Secretary on this one."
The Home Office said it was "extremely disappointed" and was considering appealing.
