LABOUR'S Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, has dipped her toe into the question of immigration, particularly that to Scotland. Our country, said Ms Cooper, would need another one million immigrants to ensure pensions were affordable in a separate Scotland.
This would be over the coming 30 years or so and, in fact, would not represent all that many more than have been coming here annually over the last decade, according to official figures.
It would, of course, still mean more immigration. As we pointed out earlier this week, there would have to be many more immigrants to ensure that enough arrived to pay sufficent taxes.
So Ms Cooper's figure of one million is probably well short of what would be required to offset the growing older, non-productive population.
Present experience has shown that not all those who have come to Scotland work and pay taxes. Many do not. Some return home as soon as they have made enough money, others disappear into the black economy.
Lately, the net number of immigrants - the figure which takes account of those in Scotland who have emigrated each year - has actually fallen quite dramatically.
This may reflect the improving global economy, and the prospect of an independent Scottish state having to actively recruit foreign workers from those countries much less likely to have the kind of talents and training which we require.
