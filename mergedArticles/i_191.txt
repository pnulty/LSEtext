News | The Opinion Matrix COMMENT FROM HOME & ABROAD FARAGE vs CLEGG
Daily Mirror Nigel Farage's appeals to get our country back, stem immigration and oust the establishment have a gut appeal. It is easy to sneer at the simplicity of his arguments but it is impossible to ignore their popularity. (Jason Beattie) Daily Telegraph Farage's profile will have been elevated the most. In the first debate he was sweaty and shouty. In this one he was cool and in command and looked - in American presidential language - like the incumbent. What the visuals confirm is that Ukip is capturing an important part of the political zeitgeist. (Tim Stanley)
