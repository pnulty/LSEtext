DURING the past decade the number of EU immigrants claiming benefits in the UK has rocketed by 150 per cent to 121,280. The effects of the EU's aggressive expansion policy are clear to see - the biggest single group of migrants claiming benefits were the 26,500 unemployed Poles picking up state handouts paid for by taxpayers.
This is madness. The vast number of migrants allowed to waltz into this country courtesy of the EU's open door policy has placed an unsustainable burden on our civic infrastructure. As well as the direct costs to the Government of handing out benefits and providing public services - which we, as taxpayers, ultimately pay for - immigration has depressed wages and increased unemployment.
This country needs to be freed from Brussels and free to reverse the shocking rise in immigration.
