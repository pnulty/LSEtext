DAVID CAMERON has warned that Nigel Farage poses a "threat" to Britain's economy and urged people to look to the "politics of answers not anger".
Mr Cameron has admitted for the first time that the Conservatives will have a "tough" time getting their message across in the European elections.
In a visit to an engineering company in Gloucestershire, Mr Cameron said that while Ukip offers "an attractive–sounding protest", the Conservatives offer a "grown–up set of policies and debate".
He said that Ukip would "build fortress Britain" and "give up on the world" while the Conservatives would negotiate for the reform of the European Union before offering the public a referendum.
He said: "We need a sensible, grownup set of policies and debate, rather than a set of slogans with no answers.
"In the end I know people are frustrated with their politicians, sometimes angry that we haven't taken more steps to deal with some of these issues. But what we've got to have is the politics of answers rather than the politics of anger.
"We have got to fix these problems. Fix our welfare system so it rewards the hard–working, fix our immigration system so it benefits the whole of our country, get our taxes down so we see living standards rise."
