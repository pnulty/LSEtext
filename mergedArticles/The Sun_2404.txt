THE good times are back, baby — so let's all get the party started.
Well, so say three separate reports over the past two weeks.
First the Central Bank forecasted a positive outlook for 2014.
Then IBEC said more than 50,000 jobs will be created this year.
And on Friday, the ESRI insisted the Government may not have to make any more brutal Budget cuts if the economy continues to grow. Except it's not quite that simple ... Another less heralded report released by Teagasc on Friday showed the devastating effects of unemployment and immigration in rural Ireland. It found that the midlands, southeast and west have the highest concentration of economically deprived towns. There is a massive disconnect here.
While the numbers look good to economic eggheads in Dublin, try telling that to people on the scratcher in Sligo, Shannon and Slane.
