ROLANDS Brize admitted attempted rape in April last year. He was caught at the scene by police after his victim managed to alert emergency services. Despite admitting his crime in court a year ago he has still not been sentenced and the case has now been adjourned 11 times while doctors try to assess his mental state.
The judge presiding thinks it is “turning into a scandal”.
The victim said, “I feel there is a lack of concern for me and how this crime has affected me. The emphasis seems to be on the criminal.” She is right to feel that way.
This farce has caused her immense distress; she has now had to attend court time after time hoping to see justice done. She has also been denied closure, vital in helping victims psychologically recover from the effects of violent crime.
This is all so doctors can spend months on end trying and thus far failing to reach a conclusion on Brize’s mental health.
It is completely the wrong way round for our justice system to be causing harm to the victim of a violent crime by accommodating the needs and wishes of her attacker.

English must be learnt by all immigrants
Nearly half of the children admitted to primary school in Bolton last year struggled to speak English properly. This is in no small part due to immigration, but it is also a dire failure on the part of the parents.
They owe it both to their children and to their new home to make sure that their offspring speak the local language proficiently.
Children who start school and haven’t been taught to speak English will inevitably lag behind those who do so fluently.
Furthermore any immigrants coming to this country should be willing and able to engage with our culture of which the language is a key component.
Failure to learn English and take part in what makes Britain British will only invite division.
It is one thing for immigrants to teach their children their own language, but they must be able to speak English too.
It is for their benefit and the benefit of the whole country.

Lost dog found by loving owner's helicopter search
Any competition to find Britain’s most loved dog would be hard fought, but boxer Murphy would certainly have to be a contender.
His owner Lewis Blythe was so distraught after his pet wriggled free from his lead and ran away that he even hired a helicopter as part of the five-day search.
It will surely be a long time before Lewis lets Murphy take flight again.
