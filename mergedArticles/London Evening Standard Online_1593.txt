David Cameron has said he will work closely with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on measures to enable the expulsion of EU migrants who fail to find work.
Germany's coalition government is considering proposals to limit the time unemployed migrants from other EU member states can stay in the country looking for a job.
An official report also recommended that welfare abuses by EU migrants should be punished by a temporary entry ban.
The Government in Britain has already rushed through measures restricting EU migrants' access to benefits and enabling the expulsion of those found begging or sleeping rough ahead of the lifting of restrictions on migrants from Romania and Bulgaria.
Mr Cameron said that he would now seek to work with the Germans and other like minded allies to see if they could tighten EU rules further.
"We'll look very closely if the Germans want to take this further," he told BBC Radio Derby.
"I talked to Angela Merkel personally last week and we are going to work with her, with the Swedish prime minister, with the Dutch prime minister, on how we can tighten up in this area because it is worthwhile work."
He said that he wanted to ensure there was "free movement to come here and get a job but not free movement to come and claim benefits".
The Prime Minister has been under intense pressure to strengthen EU immigration rules from Tory MPs worried about the growing strength of the UK Independence Party.
In a broadcast debate last night with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Ukip leader Nigel Farage repeatedly raised the issue, warning 485 million people across the EU - many from very poor countries - were currently entitled to settle "unconditionally" in the UK.
