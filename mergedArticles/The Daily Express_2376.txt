TAXPAYERS are shelling out £150million a year to kick illegal immigrants out of the UK or keep them in detention while they fight to stay, the Daily Express can reveal today.
The true scale of Britain's "open door" policy is laid bare in official figures showing how 16 individuals have fought deportation for so long their bed and board alone has cost £1.5million.
They have been detained for a combined 42 years - at a cost of £100 a day each - while officials and lawyers dither over expelling them from the country.
Three are in their fourth year of detention while the others are in their third year.
Shocking Home Office figures show more than 2,700 people were being held in secure units under immigration laws at the end of last year - mainly illegal immigrants or foreign criminals awaiting deportation.
Most are destined for Algeria, Iraq, Iran or Somalia. The huge bill for holding suspected illegal immigrants in detention centres runs at £100million a year. Another £50million goes on deportations.
Ukip head of policy Tim Aker said yesterday: "This is another sickening and costly episode that will disgust decent law-abiding taxpayers. This Government would rather send out distasteful poster wagons than deal with the illegal immigration issue itself by deporting those who are here illegally."
Earlier this week we reported on chaotic scenes in Calais as at least 30 desperate migrants make a bolt for Britain every night. A makeshift camp is filled with 500 refugees and mafia gangs charge thousands of pounds for a passage across the Channel.
It is thought that more than 11,000 attempts have been made on Britain's borders in the past year alone.
Dia Chakravarty, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: "These statistics will rightly anger taxpayers.
"Not only are hard-pressed families paying for costly deportation but they are also footing the bill for keeping people in detention who do not have the right to be in this country.
"The detainees also have a right to timely hearings. Dragging these cases out is in nobody's interest."
The Home Office said: "Hardworking people expect and deserve an immigration system that is fair and we are determined to crack down on immigration offenders.
"When we do detain people it is for the minimum time possible."
