WEALTHY Brits are sparking an immigration boom by using cheap tradesmen.
Tory Immigration Minister James Brokenshire claimed the rich had fuelled an influx of foreigners by taking advantage of the cut-price workers flooding into the UK.
But he warned that “ordinary working-class Brits" had suffered as a result.
In a speech to think-tank Demos, Mr Brokenshire said: “For too long, the benefits of immigration went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour.
“Or it went to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services. But not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country."

He also disagreed with experts who insisted mass immigration was a force for good, branding the number of migrants “just too high".
He added: “Uncontrolled mass immigration can force wages down and house prices up and put pressure on social cohesion and public services.
“It can also cause displacement in the labour market."
His words contradicted comments by Lib-Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable, 70, who said he was “intensely relaxed" about mass immigration.
Mr Cable said: “Bear down on immigrants and you lose some of the most dynamic, innovative and imaginative workers in your economy."
