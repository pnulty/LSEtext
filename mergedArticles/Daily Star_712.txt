'Aggressive' telly show scrounger given Asbo
A JOBLESS immigrant who stars in a new TV show exposing foreign benefit scroungers has been slapped with an Asbo for aggressive begging.
Shameless Viorel Dinu rakes in £750 a month in handouts but pockets up to £150 extra a day on the streets.
The Roma gypsy sponger, who came to the UK in 2011, has been banned from London's Oxford Street for harassing shoppers.
Viorel, the star of Channel 5 documentary Gypsies On Benefits And Proud, travelled from Nottingham to play his flute for cash.
But after annoying passers-by with his "high-pitched screeching", the double amputee was slapped with a two-year Asbo to keep him out of central London.
Forced Westminster Magistrates' Court heard he also had previous begging convictions.
District judge Justin Barron told him: "Begging is a real problem in this area of London as so many people are doing it.
"It is clear to me that the way that you beg does cause harassment.
"There is evidence you are living off begging and probably making a good income." Viorel, 25, was charged under a 173-year-old law in July 2012 with using a "noisy instrument" for the purpose of obtaining money. The Roma gypsy, who had £150 with him when he was arrested, admitted the charge.
He was fined £35 and charged £100 in fees.
Viorel says he came to the UK as he was forced into begging in Romania to get by. In the documentary he says: "I came to the UK cos I don't have a nice life there."
The show airs next Friday, April 11, on Channel 5 at 9pm.
