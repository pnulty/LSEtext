BY THE WAY
THE continuing rise of Ukip doesn't necessarily mean the majority of Britons want to quit the European Union. Most voters are showing they want the EU to change, to go into reverse.
They want the Common Market as it was originally sold to us, a simple trading partnership between sovereign nations with none of the baggage of a political superstate.
They want Britain to make its own decisions, its own laws, its own friends, decide its own borders and immigration policy, all powers it has handed over to unelected officials.
I'm sure all the peoples of Europe want the same but their leaders are hellâ€“bent on creating a monster. Then they wonder why no one loves them.
