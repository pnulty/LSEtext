RANDOM TV irritations: Steve Cram replacing the great Dougie Donnelly at the Olympic curling. Big Immigration Row panellist Luisa Zissman accusing British people of laziness fresh from her month-long Big Brother holiday.
ITV filling its old Saturday kids' slot with Jeremy Kyle's US show. All those morons, with ridiculous tattoos and piercings, who are suddenly demanding our sympathy.
The Voice overdosing on time-wasters and sob stories. And contestant Teresa Vasiliou putting the fear of God into one of those revolving chairs with the announcement: "I just wanted to say, I've written a song for Tom Jones."
Great! Let's not hear it.
GREAT Sporting Insights. Jackie Lockhart: "The bronze may not be the comfort medal but it will be a comfort."
Chris Kamara: "It's an even game but Sunderland are on top."
Roberto Martinez: "If Barcelona score it will be an uphill mountain to climb."
And Gus Poyet: "It was either that the opposition was better than us or we were second best."
(Compiled by Graham Wray).
