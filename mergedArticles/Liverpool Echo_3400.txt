THE passing on of information by NHS bodies to the Government as part of the crackdown on "health tourism" has been upheld as lawful by the High Court.
The Immigration Rules were amended in 2011 to impose sanctions on non-UK residents with unpaid NHS debts of Â£1,000 or more.
The sanctions include refusing individuals permission to enter or remain in the country.
