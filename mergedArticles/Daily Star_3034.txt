IT looks like Lily Allen still has a long way to go before she cracks the States.
The Not Fair singer was left red-faced after having to explain to US immigration officers in New York what her profession was. (We'd have said full-time Twitter twit...)
Lil, 29, said: "When asked my profession I said 'musician'.
"He said: 'Are you gonna be the next Ellie Goulding?'" Clearly Miss Allen thought this comparison beneath her, but breathless songstress Ellie, 27, didn't seem to mind.
She responded by tweeting a snap of her shrugging. At least Lily won't have to remind anyone who she is in in Blighty. Her latest album Sheezus looks set to top the album charts on Sunday.
