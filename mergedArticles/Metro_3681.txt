A poll in the Herald had seven out of ten Scots voters agreeing with UKip policies on immigration, welfare and foreign aid. It also stated that only 26 per cent of Scots would definitely vote to stay in the EU.
Clearly we are nowhere near as left wing and pro-European on these issues as the SNP, Lib Dems and Labour would have us believe. It's an outrage than none of them would support an in-out referendum on the EU in the unlikely event of Scotland going independent. FJG, Glasgow
