LABOUR REVOLT Ed's policies great up North but fail down South, warn candidates
Chief Political Correspondent ED Miliband is facing a revolt from southern Labour candidates who fear his left-wing agenda will cost them the election.
The prospective MPs say issues that go down well in the North are a turn-off for voters in the South.
They say Mr Miliband — who boasts of promoting a One Nation Britain — is dividing the country with his policies.
The Labour leader risked polarising opinions further last night with a class war attack on the Tories and Lib Dems. The TV election broadcast depicted the Tories as toffs who relished sacking nurses and defended rich bankers.
A Labour source said last night: "We have to start saying less about austerity and more about aspiration."
The Sun has learned that Mr Miliband recently held a tense meeting with around 20 candidates standing in the South to discuss election strategy.
A source at the gathering said: "We have to stop banging on about the bedroom tax and the North-South divide because those messages are not going to win for us in the South." One disgruntled Labour candidate from a southern constituency added: "Parroting Ed's party line from HQ gets you absolutely nowhere on the doorstep. "Immigration is the number one issue voters have with us — and by a country mile."
kevin.schofield@the-sun.co.uk The Sun Says — Page Eight THE 2015 General Election result will be a dead heat, a major study has predicted.
The Tories and Labour will each bag 36 per cent of votes, with the Lib Dems on 10 per cent, said Southampton and Manchester Universities' Polling Observatory. That would probably give the Lib Dems 15 MPs, the Tories 283 and Labour 325, one short of a majority.
