NIGEL Farage has dismissed a welter of criticism over "racist" posters launching Ukip's campaign for the European and local elections.
The party leader said rivals were "screaming blue murder" over the images because they did not want to have an "honest conversation" about immigration.
The robust defence came after religious figures joined MPs in condemning the images, funded with Â£1.5 million from millionaire ex-Tory donor Paul Sykes.
It is Ukip's biggest ever publicity drive, as the party aims to achieve a political earthquake by topping the polls on May 22.
Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, said it was wrong to use expressions that suggest "dismay or distress at all these people coming to this country".
Tory backbencher Nicholas Soames posted on Twitter: "At a time when our country really needs to come together, the Ukip advertising campaign is deeply divisive, offensive and ignorant."
Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: "Ukip have lowered the tone of the European debate with these spiteful and inaccurate claims on immigration which seek only to divide communities."
But Mr Farage said: "The fact that Westminster hate it and want to scream blue murder over it is because they have opened up the doors, they have fundamentally changed the lives of millions of people and they would rather we did not talk about it and just brush it under the carpet."
