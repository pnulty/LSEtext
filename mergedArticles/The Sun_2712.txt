EU MIGRANTS SURG
More than Manchester
MORE than half a million EU migrants are set to flock to Britain over the next five years, a report warns today.
The total of more than 500,000 — higher than the population of Manchester — will leave the Government's immigration policy in tatters.
Campaign group Migration Watch UK said net migration from the EU was likely to remain at about 130,000 a year until at least 2019.
Its report piles fresh pressure on PM David Cameron to win back controls over immigration after The Sun issued a "red line" demand to the PM last year. Latest figures show net immigration from the continent doubled in the last year to a record 131,000.
It took the total number of arriving Europeans to 209,000 — up from 149,000 in 2012 — while only 78,000 left.
Meanwhile immigration from outside Europe has fallen dramatically due to tough new Government rules.
But ministers are powerless to stem the tide of immigrants from the EU because of freedom of movement rules.
Migration Watch UK blamed the economic crisis in southern Europe as well as the EU's eastwards expansion into Romania and Bulgaria.
Chairman Sir Andrew Green said: "The good news is immigration from outside the EU is coming down steadily — as the Government had promised.
"The bad news is that migrants from the EU have driven the policy off course. It was crazy to have opened up our labour market and our benefit system to 100million people from countries with a standard of living less than a quarter of our own. There must now be a determined renegotiation."
He called on ministers to close the benefits system to migrants — unless they have worked in Britain for at least five years.
