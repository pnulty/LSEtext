A ROMANIAN immigrant stole £1,000 of booze just nine days after arriving in Britain.
Simon Calin, 37, loaded 54 bottles of Famous Grouse whisky into a trolley and walked out of Tesco in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.
He was given an eightweek curfew by Furness magistrates from 7pm to 7am.
He was also ordered to pay court costs of £85 and a £60 victim surcharge.
