News | NEWS IN BRIEF YARL'S WOOD
A privately run immigration removal centre for women failed to properly investigate allegations of sexual assault by one of its members of staff, it has been claimed.
An investigation was held at Serco-operated Yarl's Wood, in Bedfordshire, after the claims relating to a 29-year-old woman from Pakistan came to light, but now the company has been forced to disclose an internal report, which reveals evidence it failed to properly probe the claims.
Serco's director at Yarl's Wood, Norman Abusin, said: "We view any complaint of this type extremely seriously."
