Net migration has risen to its highest point since 2011 in a blow to the Government’s pledge to cut levels to the “tens of thousands" by the next general election.
The surge was partly driven by a huge increase in the number of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens coming to Britain, which leaped 166 per cent from 9,000 to 24,000 year-on-year.
The Office for National Statistics said estimates for the 12 months to the end of September revealed a net flow of 212,000 migrants to Britain, compared with 154,000 the previous year.
It now seems highly unlikely that David Cameron, the Prime Minister, and Theresa May, the Home Secretary, will be able to meet the net migration pledge.
Of the Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants, seven out of 10 said they were coming here to workand the rest to study.
The number of National Insurance numbers given to foreigners - an important indicator of immigration levels - showed a 19 per cent rise to 617,000 in 2013.
There were huge surges in the number of citizens coming to Britain to work from European Union countries which have been hardest hit by the economic crisis.
Data showed the number of Italians registering rose 66 per cent to 44,000, with other countries showing other large increases including Portugal (up 47 per cent, up to 30,000 people) and Spain (up 36 per cent to just under 52,000).
Poland also saw a large rise with 39 per cent more coming here last year, 111,000 compared with 80,000 in 2012.
