THE huge influx of immigrants to Britain in the last 13 years has put overwhelming strain on our public services.
Labour had two plans when they threw open our doors in 2001: to fuel a boom with cheap workers and to turn Britain into a multicultural "melting pot" they believed the Tories would hate.
They grossly underestimated how many migrants would come, the disastrous strain it would place on schools and hospitals and how much their own voters would care.
This century roughly five million has been added to Britain's headcount — more than the population of New Zealand.
More than half are immigrants. To see the effect this has had on an inner-city NHS hospital, turn to Pages 12 and 13.
It is not all negative. For example, the staff, many of them migrants themselves, work heroically.
But there are almost insurmountable language, cultural and religious barriers on the maternity ward where 80 per cent of babies have at least one foreign parent.
Most patients have jobs in Britain. But some ARE health tourists who arrive expecting the NHS to help and knowing it will not refuse.
Managers cite the booming population and austerity as the twin causes of their problems. Labour, we should not forget, are the architects of both — though they left all the unpleasant cuts to their successors.
It is worrying to watch a major hospital held together solely by the dedication and skill of its staff as the pressure relentlessly increases.
How much more can they, and the health service we all fund, stand?
