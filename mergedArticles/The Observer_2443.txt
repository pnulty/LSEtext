The report stage of the immigration bill concluded in the House of Lords last Monday. Many members took part in these vitally important debates, showing the upper chamber at its very best. Furthermore, many hundreds voted in some or all of the five divisions. However, we find it surprising that not one of the Ukip-affiliated peers chose to vote - let alone speak - during the passage of the bill. Lord Stevens of Ludgate seemed to be ill - but where was Lord Pearson of Rannoch? Or, indeed, Lord Willoughby De Broke?
There are no Ukip MPs and, as such, the House of Lords is the party's key avenue by which to hold the government to account. When one considers the attitude of Ukip's (would-be) parliamentarians to their roles in Westminster and elsewhere, their silence is deafening.
The Rev Lord Roberts of Llandudno; Baroness Afshar; Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth; Lord Carlile of Berriew and 16 other peers. See full list online at guardian.co.uk
