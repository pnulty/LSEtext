CONGRATULATIONS to Gita Lima, the Cameron children's nanny, who Guido can reveal is expecting a baby in early summer.
Usually Gita, right, keeps in the background, hitting the front pages only when blundering Tory immigration minister James Brokenshire claimed the rich paid less for their children's nannies because of mass immigration and it came out that Gita had only been granted British citizenship after Samantha Cameron was named on the application as her employer.
Critics nevertheless will not be pleased to learn that Nepal-born Gita, having only got her passport in 2010, will soon be in receipt of maternity and child benefits. The happy news means that the Downing Street nanny employment crisis is now becoming critical - George Osborne's nanny is having her leaving party next week.
