RESEARCH 150,000 migrants 'pay £1 net tax' AROUND 150,000 Eastern European immigrants pay just £1 a week net tax despite being in employment, migration campaigners have claimed.
Research from think-tank Migration Watch has compared direct taxes and National Insurance contributions paid by migrants with social benefits, such as tax credits and housing benefit, received.
Immigrants who work at minimum wage make "virtually no net contribution", Migration Watch said, and, if in a couple, they can receive more in tax credits and other benefits than they pay in tax.
Migration Watch chairman Sir Andrew Green said the research intended to combat the argument that immigrants "work hard and pay their taxes".
