DAVID CAMERON'S prospects of meeting his flagship immigration target dimmed further today as new official figures showed a net influx of 212,000 migrants last year.
The Office for National Statistics said that 526,000 people moved to Britain from abroad in 2013, up 28,000 on the number of incomers during the previous 12 months.
Only 314,000 departed giving a net migration total that now stands at more than double the Prime Minister's target of reducing the inflow to below 100,000 by next year's general election.
One of the main reasons for the latest surge in immigration is a continuing flow of Poles and other European citizens into this country. Today's statistics show that a total of 201,000 EU citizens arrived last year.
They included 23,000 Romanians and Bulgarians, who arrived before working restrictions on citizens of the two countries were lifted at the end of 2013, and 70,000 more from the East European countries such as Poland that joined the EU in 2004.
Separate statistics today also show that the number of East Europeans applying for National Insurance numbers to join the workforce continues to grow with 102,000 Poles, 47,000 Romanians and 18,000 Bulgarians registering in the 12 months to the end of March this year.
The largest number of arrivals are still from outside Europe, however, with today's migration figures showing a total of 249,000 arrivals from countries in the rest of world such as India, Pakistan, Australia and nations across Africa.
Some Tory MPs have already called on Mr Cameron to abandon his target amid warnings from business and university leaders that it is harming Britain's economic prospects.
Immigration minister James Brokenshire insisted, however, that the Government was right to be trying to limit the inflow from abroad because of the pressure that large numbers of arrivals placed on existing residents: He added: "Uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on our public services and forces down wages for people on low incomes."
Today's net inflow of 212,000 during 2013 compares with a total of 177,000 in 2012, but is significantly below the record levels seen under the Labour government when the net migration figure peaked at 320,000 during 2005.
