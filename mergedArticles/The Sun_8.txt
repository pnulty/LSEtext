BRITAIN'S £108million EuroMillions winner Neil Trotter was last night linked to online racehate messages in which the far-right British National Party is praised. Someone using the name "Chameleon" — the same name as a company linked to Neil — said BNP leader Nick Griffin's 2009 suggestion to sink boats carrying illegal immigrants was "spot on". Almost 400 posts on car site PassionFord are attributed to a user called Chameleon with some signed off "Neil". Mr Trotter, 41, of Coulsdon, South London, declined to comment.
