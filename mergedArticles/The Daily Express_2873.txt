CHANCELLOR George Osborne faced embarrassment yesterday as his father-in-law claimed immigration policies make Britain look "nasty".
Conservative Lord Howell chairs a House of Lords committee that yesterday called for an urgent overhaul of "tone" and policies it said were damaging Britain's ability to forge international alliances and global influence. Its report called for students to be removed from migration targets and efforts to ensure legitimate visitors "can access UK visas quickly, easily and cheaply".
It added: "The Government must present and communicate their visa and immigration policies with a level of balance and in a tone that do not discourage those who would add to the UK's prosperity from coming to the UK and supporting its businesses.
We do not believe that this is always the case at present."
Lord Howell said: "This country has got to be open for business which means we've got to welcome the right people, including a lot of students and brilliant skilled people who add to our power in the world and keep out those who would damage us. This requires very careful handling. We are not getting it right."
He said the visa policy and some handling of immigration policy was creating a blot, a nasty Britain feeling.
He added: "Many business people who want to move into Britain to develop and strengthen our economy are finding it very difficult to get through the tangle of regulations."
Downing Street said: "The Government's immigration policy is focused on having a tightly controlled immigration system that attracts the brightest and best to Britain."
