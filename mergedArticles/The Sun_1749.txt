COPS are probing bizarre footage of a patrol car driving in a city centre — blasting out the rap track Sound of Da Police.
The marked police vehicle was filmed in a pedestrianised street at night playing the KRS One ode to cop-slaying immigrants.
Passers-by in Chelmsford, Essex, are heard laughing at the rap, used in cult film La Haine, which portrayed violent cop clashes with gangs. A police spokesman said: "We are looking into it."
