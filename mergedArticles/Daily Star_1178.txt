A MAN murdered his unfaithful wife in an honour killing because he resented her "Westernised" lifestyle of nightclubs, drinking and boyfriends.
Muslim Jahangir Nazar, 35, stabbed Farkhanda Younis 19 times after she returned home from having sex with one of her lovers.
Nazar tried to call her 25 times and laid in wait for her at home in Chadderton, near Manchester.
Body
Ms Younis, 30, was stabbed in the neck while her six-year-old son from a previous marriage slept in his bedroom.
Her body was found under her duvet after the little boy rang 999.
Pakistan-born Nazar, an illegal immigrant, married Ms Younis in an Islamic ceremony in 2012 in the belief marriage would allow him to stay in the UK.
He was jailed for life and must serve a minimum of 22 years after being found guilty of murder.
John Jones, prosecuting at Manchester Crown Court, said Nazar was a "possessive, controlling and violent partner".
