DEREK JEFFERY claims that UKIP's Nigel Farage may be the most popular politician in the country (Watch out for Nigel, ECHO, April 19). In this case, it is worth taking a closer look at what UKIP actually stands for? UKIP has long been indulged as the 'loveable rogues' of British politics, but in the last year or two they have lurched dramatically toward the extremist ground vacated by the imploding BNP. The bigots and 'fruitcakes' are not loose cannons in the party; they reflect UKIP policies perfectly.
UKIP uses fictional bogeymen and mythical threats - such as benefit tourists, and swarms of Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants - to justify their divisive policies. They use the spectre of 'health tourists' to attack the principle of a universal NHS free at the point of use.
Even more than the big three parties, UKIP stands for cuts and privatisation, low wages, racism, homophobia and xenophobia. UKIP's policies would strip workers and consumers of hard-won rights and protections. UKIP favour even greater wealth inequality.
The real threat of UKIP is that people may be drawn to them as a protest vote. This, in turn, could tempt the mainstream parties to lurch further to the right, to ape UKIP's regressive and divisive policies.
I would urge everyone to vote carefully in the local and European elections in May.
