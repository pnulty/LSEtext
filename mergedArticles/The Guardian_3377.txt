Worrying about immigration is not prejudice, Ed Miliband has said. But the Labour leader said he would not give "false promises" such as setting a target to cut net immigration.
He admitted his party had too often turned its back on concerns about immigration. The remarks signal a Labour decision to readdress immigration in the final days of campaigning before Thursday's local and European elections.
He said: "We will never again turn our backs on people who are worried about immigration. But neither will we turn our back on the rest of the world."
Miliband said the election was the most unpredictable in a generation, and he had known for a long time that immigration was "a big issue on the doorstep".
He said his party had been on a journey on the issue. He told Airbus workers at Broughton, North Wales: "I don't believe it is prejudiced to worry about immigration. We said that people needed to change their attitudes. But in fact, we needed to change ours.
"Because people see their communities changing fast around them. They worry about the entitlements people have when they come here and the pressure it might put on the system. And, especially with the cost of living crisis, people ask about the impact on their wages and terms and conditions." However, in a BBC World at One interview, Miliband said he opposed the government's target of net immigration falling below 100,000, and rejected blocking the free movement of workers in the EU.
Admitting there was deep discontent, he said: "I am not going to set false targets and make false promises to people. Too many politicians have done that." Patrick Wintour
