Police hold eight men and three women after dawn raids
SUSPECTED bogus brides and grooms were arrested in dawn raids across Greater Manchester.
Immigration Service officers swooped to make 11 arrests. All those held are suspected of helping to arrange sham marriages or taking part in bogus ceremonies.
The Home Office Immigration Service said the raids followed an investigation into a suspected 'sham marriage ring' believed to be based in Manchester. Two further arrests were made in Liverpool.
The raids are linked to a number of weddings which took place at Darwen Register Office, near Blackburn, between January and June last year. The ceremonies all involved Pakistani men and Portuguese women.
All 11 were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to breach the UK's immigration laws and are being questioned.
Four Pakistani men aged between 21 and 33, a 29-year-old Pakistani woman and a 22-year-old Portuguese woman were arrested at a house on Hornbeam Road, Levenshulme.
A 25-year-old Pakistani man was held at a house on Stainer Street and a 54-year-old Pakistani man at a house on Northmoor Road, both Longsight.
At Rawcliffe Street, Moss Side, a 56-year-old British woman and a 25-year-old Pakistani man were arrested. A 44-year-old Pakistani man was also held at a house on Hurford Avenue.
Nick Wood, from the Home Office's north west criminal and financial investigations team, said: ""Where there are suspi-cions that a relationship may not be genuine, we will investigate and, if necessary, intervene. "We are determined to stop migrants abusing the marriage system to cheat immigration rules."
