BANNING translators for driving theory tests is an excellent decision by the Government. There will be some critics who will decry the ban as racist but making everyone take exams in English, Welsh or British sign language will help immigrants learn the language of their adopted country.
Since 2008 almost 1,300 passes have been revoked following investigations into the improper conduct of interpreters. Between February 2008 and December 2009 one in five tests using an interpreter was found to be fraudulent. That is a vast number of people to have progressed through the system despite falling short of the required knowledge.
Once they have passed the theory test learner drivers are then able to apply for the practical test, meaning they are just one step away from heading out on to the roads by themselves.
Cars are dangerous and we have to take all the precautions necessary to make sure that people are honestly good enough to warrant receiving their licence.
Transport Minister Stephen Hammond said: "By stopping driving tests in foreign languages we will cut out the risk of fraud and help to ensure that all drivers can read road signs and fully understand the rules of the road."
