A SENIOR Tory MP yesterday accused Nigel Farage of 'fake sincerity' as he urged the Prime Minister not to try to 'out-Ukip Ukip' on immigration.
Mark Field warned his party not to get into a bidding war with Ukip on the eve of the TV debate between Mr Farage and Nick Clegg. He said: 'If you can fake sincerity, you've really got it made. There is a bit of that to the smoking a fag and having a pint of beer'.
Mr Field also accused Ukip -whose leader is often pictured drinking and smoking - of wanting to stick 'two fingers up to the entire political class'.
And he warned against aspiring to live in the Britain of the 1950s. Mr Field spoke out at the launch of the new group Conservatives for a Managed Migration, which wants David Cameron to scrap his target to reduce net migration to the 'tens of thousands'.
The City of London MP pointed to 'alarming' figures suggesting Polish nationals living in the UK were three times more likely to vote Labour in May's European elections, despite being natural Tory supporters.
He added: 'We cannot out-Ukip Ukip on immigration, and nor should we try to on immigration, especially as we will not be able to match their offering of withdrawal on the EU'.
