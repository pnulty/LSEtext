THE Home Office was last night trawling through records to establish the extent of the immigration scandal uncovered by the Mail.
Officials want to find out how many migrants who can speak no English might have bought a certificate saying they had passed a language test.
The scam, which paves the way to British citizenship, giving them access to a full range of benefits, costs just £500. The deception focuses on exam centres, licensed by the Home Office.
We revealed how staff at one centre in Upton Park, East London, run by Learn Pass Succeed (LPS) - responsible for passing 50,000 candidates - sold pass certificates to migrants who did not even sit the test or take a course.
LPS has been suspended by the examining body, EMD.
A Home Office spokesman said: 'A full investigation is ongoing.'
