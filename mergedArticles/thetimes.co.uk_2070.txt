Immigrants who come to live in Britain must learn to speak English and “respect our way of life”, the culture secretary has said.
Sajid Javid, the first man of Asian origin to be appointed to the Cabinet, said that immigrants had to make a contribution to their new country.
“I think it’s perfectly reasonable for British people to say, look, if you’re going to settle in Britain and make it your home, you should learn the language of the country and you should respect its laws and its culture.” he told the Sunday Telegraph.
Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, said that people were entitled to expect that immigrants made a contribution to society and criticised those who had failed assimilate into the British way of life, despite living here for many years. “I know people myself, I have met people who have been in Britain for over 50 years and they still can’t speak English,” he said.
He added: “People also say, when immigrants do come to Britain, that they should come to work, and make a contribution and that they should also respect our way of life, and I agree with all of that. It means things like trying to learn English.”
Mr Javid said that there was no place in the English legal system for the practice of Sharia law amid concern that Sharia courts have been established in cities such as London and Birmingham, “Where people want to have their own private arrangements between them, that is a matter for them. But there is no place for Sharia law in British law.”
He said: “People want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right”.
