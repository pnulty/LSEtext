A TOP judge blasted for going soft on foreign criminals has been axed over an illegal immigrant who lived with him.
Richard McKee, 65, agreed to step down after telling bosses he was giving the Nigerian woman financial support.
The Lord Chief Justice's office hit the roof after Fatima Umar, 39, was arrested at the home she shared with the judge and assaulted TWO police constables.
She was found to have overstayed her UK visa.
Umar is serving two eight-week jail terms for the twin assault and causing £5,000 damage at the judge's London flat.
Mr McKee ruled in favour of ELEVEN foreign criminals in 13 cases.
Last night, MPs were demanding answers after it emerged the judge can retire on a full pension of at least £50,000 a year.
Tory backbencher Dominic Raab said: "It beggars belief that a judge tasked with defending our borders has been helping someone who has flouted them."
