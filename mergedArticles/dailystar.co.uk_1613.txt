BURLY ex-boxer Ray Bulloch is Britain’s gayest builder.
Ray, 49, carries pink tools, wears a pink hard hat and drives a pink van.
And he always cranks up the volume on the radio when the Pet Shop Boys, Donna Summer and Village People’s hits are being played.
Ray decided to camp it up after suffering homophobic bullying and abuse in the construction industry.
The final straw was when he saw a young apprentice sabotaging a gay customer’s bathroom.

His firm, R&G Builders and Property Maintenance, has proved to be a big hit.
He hopes to recruit other gay builders to expand into Manchester and Brighton.
Ray, of Plaistow, east London, said: “I have a van which is blinged up and my logo was ‘Powered by fairydust’.
“But then I thought to myself that I wanted to be really open and not care what people think.
“So I had the whole van painted pink.
“I even get straight builders telling me how lovely the colour is.”
Ray, who came out 15 years ago when his wife Erica died aged 33, added: “There was a lot of abuse at work and the way people were being treated got up my nose.
“It’s not about getting in people’s faces but showing I’m not any different to anybody else.”
