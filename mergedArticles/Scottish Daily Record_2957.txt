NIGEL Farage's politics have no place in Scotland.
This newspaper stands completely opposed to UKIP's divisive anti-EU and anti-immigration policies.
The party's values are at odds with the progressive, welcoming country Scotland has become.
That is why it was so frustrating last year when a few pathetic protesters managed to boost Farage's profile by harassing him on a campaign trip to Scotland.
Pictures of the ugly episode were beamed around the world and made Scotland look narrow-minded and prejudiced.
Alex Salmond spoke a lot of sense yesterday when he called for Farage to be beaten at the ballot box.
Thankfully yesterday's demonstration on Farage's return to Edinburgh was a calmer, mature protest against UKIP's politics.
On May 22, Scotland will vote in the European elections. That is when we can all really send Nigel Farage a message.
