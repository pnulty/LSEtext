SCOTLAND's education system is "subsidising" the English economy by GBP30 billion a year through Scots moving south, former SNP leader Gordon Wilson has claimed in a new report.
Options for Scotland has called for control over tax and immigration to encourage families to stay and have children and foreigners to settle in Scotland. The new paper claimed Scotland's education system was paying around GBP30bn a year to educate and train young people, who then move to other parts of the UK - with no benefit to the Scottish economy.
Mr Wilson, who led the SNP from 1979 to 1990, said the claim was based on an estimated cost of educating a Scottish student at GBP72,832 and 391,000 Scots then moving to England.
Over the next 50 years the Scottish population is predicted to grow by 4.4 per cent, against 22.8 per cent growth in the rest of the UK. Mr Wilson said: "The message is stark. Without children, the nation dies."
