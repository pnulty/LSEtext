Britain will vote to stay in the European Union at a referendum, David Cameron has predicted. The Prime Minister said he was "confident" that when voters are given the choice, they will opt to remain in.
The Prime Minister yesterday returned from a visit to Hanover where he met the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. He has promised to renegotiate Britain's EU membership and put the new deal to a referendum by 2017.
He told Bild newspaper: "I'm confident we can secure those changes and we'll have a referendum in Britain before the end of 2017 on an in-out basis. I'm confident that Britain will want to stay in a reformed European Union."
?Three in 10 voters could be persuaded to choose Ukip because of their views on Europe or immigration, says Robert Ford of the University of Manchester, in research which suggests the party's potential support has not yet peaked.
