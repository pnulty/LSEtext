Peers have thrown out the Government's plans to allow terror suspects to be stripped of their British citizenship even if they will be left stateless.
The amendment to the Immigration Bill was backed last night by 242 votes to 180, as peers hit out at a policy "used by tyrants and dictators". Under the Government's plans, Home Secretary Theresa May would have been able to remove the citizenship of a naturalised Briton who had acted in a way "seriously prejudicial to the vital interests" of the country.
Lord Pannick, a leading QC and crossbencher who put forward the amendment, said: "There are regrettably all too many dictators around the world willing to use the creation of statelessness as a weapon against opponents."
