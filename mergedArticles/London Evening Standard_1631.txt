GEORGE Osborne's father-in-law today said that the Government's tough immigration crackdown was leading to a "nasty Britain" image.
Lord Howell is chairman of the parliamentary Soft Power committee, which published a report today on the effects of the coalition's immigration policies.
The father of 45-year-old Frances Osborne told BBC radio that Britain had to be "open for business", which meant letting in talented students and skilled workers while blocking entry to dangerous individuals.
He said: "Now this requires very careful handling. We're not getting it right. All our witnessesâ€¦ and a vast amount of written evidence said the visa policy and some of the handling of immigration policy was creating rather a block, creating a nasty Britain feeling."
The committee's report said the Government needed to use all avenues to create a positive image of Britain around the world.
