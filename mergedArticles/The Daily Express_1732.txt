TENS of thousands of parents were told yesterday their children had not won a place in their first choice primary school.
Parents of some 600,000 infants learned the result on the first primary school "National Offer Day".
But about one in seven, some 86,000, cannot attend their preferred school from September, it is estimated.
A survey by the Press Association of more than 50 councils found just under 87 per cent of four-year-olds nationally will get their first choice.
The rising birth rate and impact of immigration are blamed.
The Department for Education said that it had "more than doubled to Â£5billion the funding available to councils to create new school places".
