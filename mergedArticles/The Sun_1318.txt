As Gogglebox - the series where we watch other people watching TV - returns, here's a guide to our favourite armchair critics

STEPH & DOMINIC FROM KENT HOME LIFE
Married posh couple Steph and Dom Parker are legendary for their booze consumption - champers, Bloody Mary with a shot of sherry, screwdrivers and red wine - and their fruity exchanges. TV FAVOURITES Steph was impressed with Downton Abbey: "I wonder how many windows they've got? We've got 63." And they had a lovely sing-along to One Direction's recent hit Story Of My Life.
TV HATES
Grand Designs tops Steph's list - she once said of Kevin McCloud: "Do you think he knows he's an a**e?" And she wasn't keen on the kids' film Home Alone either: "Thank God that's over. Can we watch some porn now?" Dom was appalled by the antics on Made In Chelsea when the cast were spraying around champagne. But Steph put his mind at ease: "It'll be Prosecco, darling."
JUNE & LEON FROM LIVERPOOL HOME LIFE
Retired teachers June and Leon Bernicoff have been married for 53 years. Dermot O'Leary told TV Magazine he'd like to take caustic Leon down to The X Factor to show him how hard it is to make TV.
TV FAVOURITES
Nigella Lawson's show, Nigellissima. Leon: "Very attractive, Nigella. Well busted." (Cue June shaking her head). June is a Susanna Reid on Strictly admirer: "If I had legs like her, I'd show them off."
TV HATES
Prime Minister David Cameron. Leon: "He makes me sick. As weak as dishwater, he is." Also, he's not a fan of Strictly's Tess Daly and her pronunciation of the word 'bumper'. "False Bolton accent," he reckons.
SANDY & SANDRA FROM BRIXTON, SOUTH LONDON HOME LIFE
Sandy Channer and best pal Sandra Martin have been mates for over 40 years. Both are unemployed and love their soaps and sitcoms.
TV FAVOURITES
Sandra has a big soft spot for Rebecca Adlington and wasn't happy when she talked on I'm A Celebrity about how she'd suffered abuse over her nose.
"Listen, girl, you're beautiful," she shouted at the telly.
"F*** the nose!" TV HATES Sandra wasn't keen on Britney Spears when she made an appearance on Alan Carr: Chatty Man, declaring: "She's fat."
And when Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg appeared on a Lib Dem Party Political Broadcast, Sandy said: "He's a trier." But Sandra rebutted: "He's a d***head trier."
