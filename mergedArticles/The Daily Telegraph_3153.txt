THE number of eastern European migrants who came to Britain in the past decade was hundreds of thousands higher than previously thought, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
The agency admitted it had failed to count an estimated 350,000 arrivals between 2001 and 2011.
The disclosure is expected to lead to further intense national concern about immigration.
The ONS said the mistake occurred because it used "inadequate sampling" in a crucial survey at airports.
This is intended to estimate net migration – the difference between the number of people arriving in Britain and those emigrating.
It said most of the migrants who were omitted from the International Passenger Survey (IPS) were from Poland and other former Communist states that joined the European Union in 2004, known as EU8 countries.
The revised totals showed net migration over the decade increased from just under 2.2 million to more than 2.5 million.
The ONS revealed that in 2006 net migration is now thought to have reached 265,000 – 67,000 higher than previously stated.
Original estimates were too low because the ONS concentrated its survey on main airports such as Heathrow, but ignored migrants arriving on a growing number of budget airline routes into smaller, regional airports, said the report.
"There is evidence that shows the IPS missed a substantial amount of immigration of EU8 citizens that occurred between 2004 and 2008, prior to IPS improvements from 2009," it added.
"The EU8 migrants were missed due to IPS interviewing being concentrated at the time at airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester."
Labour, which was in power at the time, has admitted it was wrong not to impose restrictions on eastern Europeans' ability to come to Britain from 2004. Sir Andrew Green, the chairman of MigrationWatch UK, which campaigns for stricter migration rules, said: "This is final confirmation that net foreign migration under Labour totals nearly four million, two thirds from outside the European Union.
"It also shows that the peak of net migration was nearly 275,000 a year, making it even more difficult for the present Government to get the numbers down to tens of thousands."
It came as Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said that the number of eastern European immigrants in Britain was a "big concern" because of pressure on wages and public services.
