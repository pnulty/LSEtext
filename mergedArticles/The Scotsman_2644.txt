BRITPOP icon Jarvis Cocker is to visit Glasgow for the city's newest arts festival, to discuss Britain's steelmaking heritage.
The Pulp frontman turned film-maker to pay tribute to the industrial heritage of his home city of Sheffield with a film entitled The Big Melt.
Cocker and co-director Martin Wallace are among guests confirmed for a new documentary festival, Art Screen, which the BBC is launching in Glasgow next month.
The event will also feature award-winning director Julien Temple, famous for documenting the rise of The Sex Pistols, who will unveil his new film showing the darker side of Rio de Janeiro in the run-up to the World Cup this summer and the 2016 Olympics.
The festival will also see the first screening of a documentary charting the creation of the new Reid Building at Glasgow School of Art.
Director Martin Scorsese has recorded a special message for the festival, to be shown before a screening of his 1974 documentary Italianamerican, in which he interviewed his Italian immigrant parents in their New York apartment.
Art Screen runs from 10-13 April at Glasgow Film Theatre and CCA.
