PRESIDENT Michael D Higgins this morning extended his St Patrick's Day greeting with a strong focus on immigration.
And he hailed the most famous migrant of all who arrived here under "very challenging circumstances" — the patron saint himself.
Mr Higgins said: "Despite the fact that he was a Roman-Briton who came to Ireland as a slave, Patrick forgave his captors and accepted the Irish he encountered as his own community.
"We are also conscious of how the theme of migration has remained an important part of our national narrative."
