EVERY single day the British taxpayer hands out benefits to immigrants, thereby encouraging scroungers from across the EU to come here and take advantage of the State's generosity. When Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Britain in February, benefit tourism was high on the agenda for her talks with David Cameron. Now proposals from the German government have been revealed showing how they plan to tackle the issue.
The measures include powers to screen immigrants to assess their chances of finding work, the deportation of migrants found guilty of benefit fraud, and the provision of child support only to those who pay tax. If Germany - shackled in theory by the same EU rules as Britain is - can make these strides in addressing their immigrant problem then why can't we do it too? Ultimately these moves don't go far enough, but it would be a start.
