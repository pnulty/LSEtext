70,000 from around world came to Mersey in last 10 years
NEARLY 70,000 migrants have flocked to Merseyside in the past 10 years, figures show.
There were 45,583 immigrants given work permits in Liverpool alone between 2004 and 2013.
This included 5,082 last year - mostly from EU member countries in Eastern Europe.
Over the past decade 66,765 immigrants have arrived in the Merseyside region, the Office for National Statistics said.
London is way out on top in the stats league with 2.4m over the same ten year period.
Merseyside is mid-table compared to other major cities in the country with Birmingham registering 123,297, Manchester 103,496, Cardiff 40,015 and Newcastle 37,257.
The figures are for people being granted permission to work in Britain, and don't include any relatives they may bring with them.
Critics say immigration is damaging Britain, but one former Merseyside businessman told the Sunday ECHO, foreign nationals are vital to fill job vacancies.
Terry Jones, leader of the Conservatives on Sefton council, said: "I used to own a bakery in Southport and it was difficult to get staff.
"I was offering good money but no-one was interested.
Immigration is necessary at times to fill jobs.
"For every job I advertised, three out of four applicants were immigrants."
He added: "But people coming here for benefits is not acceptable.
"We do need to cap immigration and we need to make British workers less reliant on handouts." The figures show 2,141 immigrants moved to Halton between 2004 and last year, 1,773 to Knowsley, 6,397 to Wirral, 3,530 to St Helens and 9,482 to Sefton.
These included 222 to Halton last year alone, 139 to Knowsley, 503 to Wirral, 320 to St Helens and 794 to Sefton.
But an anti-immigration pressure group predicts migration will rise further in Britain.
Speaking about the national immigration figures, Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: "Government policy is succeeding in bringing down non-EU migration, but they have been blown off course by a sharp increase of 66,000 migrants from the EU.
"These figures also show that net migration from Romania and Bulgaria was about 20,000 in the year to last September even before the restrictions were lifted."
