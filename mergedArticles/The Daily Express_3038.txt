GOOD quality care depends on many things. Innate kindness, patience and empathy are important but these qualities cannot be taught. Another is the ability to communicate with the people who are being looked after. Communication can include a touch or a smile but it must also mean speaking the same language.
There is nothing more frustrating for the carer or the person in their care if neither can understand what the other is saying. It can lead to frustration, to anger and even to abuse. It is a particularly acute problem if the patient is suffering from dementia.
Many carers working here today are migrants, doing the essential and not–very–well–paid jobs that sadly many Britons have no wish to do.
Many are splendid and the caring professions could not function without them.
But it is right that the issue of poor language skills has been high–lighted and that proficiency in English should be part of the new "care certificate". This would be a guarantee for employers and patients that healthcare assistants and support workers have all the necessary skills.
As Dr Shereen Hussein, adviser to the Department of Health, outlines, ability in English can be tested through a simple interview process. It is not, as they say, rocket science. But it would be beneficial and also send a signal that even in a country of many immigrants English must be spoken.
