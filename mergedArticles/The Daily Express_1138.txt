EACH week no fewer than 4,000 National Insurance numbers are given to migrants from Eastern Europe. But even this staggering figure fails to reveal the true scale of immigration, for those who apply for NI numbers are those who intend to work and pay tax, not those who don't.
This is one of the facts to emerge about EU migration from new data published by the Department for Work and Pensions showing where migrants have settled in the UK. The 1.2 million Poles have tended to settle in north London, Edinburgh and Birmingham. Lithuanians (256,000 all told) go to agricultural East Anglia, Romanians and Bulgarians make for the Welsh borders and Czechs favour Manchester.
Since 2002, 2.3 million migrants from former communist countries have moved here and last year saw more arrive here than at any time since 2008. Significantly these figures do not include the Romanians and Bulgarians who have come here since the beginning of the year when visa restrictions were dropped.
We are used to hearing about such large numbers of people but having a sense of where they are settling, swelling and changing the face of entire regions brings home the sense of an unstoppable movement that is beyond the control of government or local authorities.
And these, remember, are the migrants we know about, not the ones living in garden sheds or with criminal intent. Britain is losing its identity week by week.
