The Prime Minister has spoken for the first time about his decision to hire a Nepalese nanny, a week after James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, blamed the middle classes' demand for cheap foreign labour for driving up immigration.
David Cameron said Gita Lima, who cares for his three children, does a "fantastic" job. He said: "She came originally from Nepal, she carried out her exams to become a British citizen. She does a fantastic job and she certainly fits the description of someone who wants to work hard and get on."
Downing Street last week confirmed that the Prime Minister's wife Samantha had signed Ms Lima's citizenship application form.
