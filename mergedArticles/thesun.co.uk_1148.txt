BOSSES should give unemployed Brits jobs first to stop them being "undercut" by foreign workers, Iain Duncan Smith has declared.
The Work and Pensions Secretary said UK-born staff "feel very squeezed by people who come in".
His comments, to The House magazine, come after immigration minister James Brokenshire accused the well-off of employing cheap foreign nannies at the expense of their British counterparts.
Mr Duncan Smith said he backed his colleague.
He said: "He was saying the benefits of this, such as they are, tended to be in this group but not down at the bottom end, where they've tended to see the problem.
"He's right in that by the way. That is the issue. People that I deal with every day, they feel very squeezed by people who come in, under cut them in price."
He added: "Now more jobs are going to British workers than went originally, so that is the beginning of a change.
"But I'm very keen to thrash that out so try one of our unemployed people first before you go anywhere else."
Mr Duncan Smith also said he was HAPPY that so many people are now relying on handouts from food banks.
He also rejected claims that the Government's welfare reforms were to blame.
He said: "My view about this is I'm happy for people to visit food banks, I don't have a particular problem with them.
"Welfare reform is not the main driver for food banks.
"One would be now there are more food banks being set up than ever before so people are more aware of it, they've been more in the news."
