AMONG the red carpet guests at a Hollywood premiere of The Immigrant this week was one face no one recognised - even though she will one day be wealthier than many film stars.
American-born Jazmin Grace Grimaldi is the daughter of Prince Albert of Monaco and the result of the latter's fling with a waitress who was on holiday on the French Riviera in 1991.
Jazmin, 22, who is Grace Kelly's granddaughter, will eventually inherit a portion of her father's estimated Â£1billion fortune.
