We militate. You mitigate. They are confusibles. Both have three syllables. Both rhyme. Or, at least, if you insist, both assonate. But they have opposite meanings. As any fule, including Nigel Molesworth, kno, militate comes from the Latin miles, a soldier: one of the first words that Molesworth learnt in the days when Latin lessons were J Caesar military; before they became domestic. Events or people now militate against or with something or other. They conflict or are inconsistent with something else. 1838: "Everything may militate for, and nothing militate against, its authenticity."
Mitigate means to appease or mollify. The Latin mitis means soft or gentle. To mitigate is to render something or someone milder, less hostile. It is the older Latin immigrant into the language. Thomas More's History of King Richard III, which was used by Shakespeare: "Where the King took displeasure, she would mitigate and appease his mind." It is a trick that the two similarsounding words mean the opposites. Distinguishing them is one of the many reasons for having a little Latin; like Shakespeare.
