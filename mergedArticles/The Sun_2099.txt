MORE than 700 desperate migrants charged barbed-wire border fences in North Africa.
But the would-be refugees were repulsed by guards protecting the small Spanish territory of Melilla, situated on the coast of Morocco.
Officials said the first wave of 500 people rushed the border on Friday and another 200 were intercepted by Moroccan cops yesterday.
Spain's North African enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta have been targeted by a tide of African immigrants trying to cross into Europe.
In February 15 migrants drowned trying to enter Ceuta.
