THE City of Leeds secondary school is the first in Britain to teach all of its pupils English as if it were a foreign language. The head teacher has said that even the 15 per cent of pupils who were born in Britain need the classes because their language skills are so poor.
The school has been left in an impossible position by rampant immigration. Filling our classrooms with pupils who cannot communicate with the staff and children around them is desperately unfair. The ability to speak English well enough to keep up with the class has to be considered a basic requirement for a place in a British school. After all, there is only so much schools can achieve when many immigrant families still refuse to learn and speak English at home.
