News | DEPORTATION
A promising student threatened with deportation to her native Mauritius is isolated and finding it hard to be without her family, her headteacher has said.
Lynne Dawes, headteacher at Oasis Hadley Academy in Enfield, north London, where Yashika Bageerathi attends school, said the teenager was struggling with a "real sense of isolation" in the detention centre where she has been for a week.
Ms Bageerathi, 19, is currently in Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre in Bedfordshire following a dramatic turn of events in which she was driven back from Gatwick Airport hours before she was due to fly back on Tuesday.
The teenager fled Mauritius with her mother, younger sister and brother in 2012 to escape a relative who had been physically abusing her.
The campaign to keep her in Britain was dealt a blow when her family were told they could be deported after Ms Bageerathi's mother was told she had no grounds for appeal.
