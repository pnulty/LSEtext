A large influx of workers from southern Europe has dealt a near-fatal blow to David Cameron's promise to cut net annual migration to "tens of thousands" by next year's general election.
It leapt by 58,000 to stand at 212,000 in the year to the end of September 2013, the Office for National Statistics said. The increase was fuelled by soaring numbers of people coming from Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece, where recession has left huge unemployment totals.
There were also rises in workers arriving from Romania and Bulgaria ahead of all restrictions over entry to the UK being lifted last month.
Migration from the European Union is now at its highest level for 50 years.
