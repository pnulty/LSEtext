THOUSANDS of Berliners have blocked a group of right-wing extremists from staging a march through their city.
Police say some 2,000 people stood in the way of the planned route of a demonstration organised by the National Democratic Party yesterday. The NPD had planned to march through the Kreuzberg district, which has a large immigrant population.
Germany's security services say the party has a racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic agenda.
Police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf said the 100 far-right activists were only able to march for 200 metres before they were blocked.
