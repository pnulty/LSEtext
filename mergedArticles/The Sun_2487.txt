LIB Dems have been issued with a Dad's Army-style "Don't panic!" warning over Ukip.
A five-page dossier on how to deal with the anti-EU party at May's Euro elections urges campaigners "not to panic", like Clive Dunn's Corporal Jones suggests in the TV comedy.
It also gives advice on how to spot Ukip voters — such as those who "spontaneously mention immigration". It comes as Deputy PM Nick Clegg accused Nigel Farage's Euro-MPs of "not standing up for British interests". But a Ukip spokesman said the Lib Dems are "panicking" after having "lost the British public".
