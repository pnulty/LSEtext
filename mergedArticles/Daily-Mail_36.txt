For almost three years she has covered the showbiz stories of the day alongside Mario Lopez.
But it looks like Maria Menounos will be venturing out on her own.
The 35-year-old television personality will no longer co-host the entertainment show Extra according to reports on Monday.
Maria has decided to willingly leave the show amid speculation of a rift between her and 40-year-old co-host since 2011: Mario Lopez.
However a source told People that those rumours are untrue.
'There's no Mario-Maria thing. She has no problem with him. She's fine with her co-host.'
The source added:'It was a mutual understanding' between Menounos and Extra to part ways.
'She's exploring a few options right now. There was absolutely no drama.'
There have also been reports that Maria was fired, which the source says are also false.
'She was not fired. She wasn't ousted,' the source told the weekly. 'No one is pushing her out.'
The former Dancing With The Stars contestant currently stars in her own reality show titled Chasing Maria Menounos.
The show premiered last week on the Oxygen network and features her boyfriend of more than 15 years, director and producer Kevin Undergaro.
Also on the show are the Greek-American beauty's parents Costas and Litsa.
The reality programme gives an inner glimpse into her life in Los Angeles living with her boyfriend of 16 years as of next month, and her traditional Greek immigrant parents, who demand that she get married and have kids.
