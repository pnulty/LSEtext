GLASGOW'S footballing tradition often gets a bad name.
But United Glasgow FC, who boast players from Somalia, Congo and Pakistan, are a shining example to the rest of the world on how to help immigrants and refugees adjust to their new lives.
Even the scientists from Oxford University were impressed.
Their study concluded the team were "not merely an integration of foreigners into Scottish society but a new creation entirely, where the identity as a footballer overrides ethnic, racial and national identities and allows players on the team to find common ground on the pitch".
Roughly translated, we think they meant that football is the universal language that should bring everyone together.
How right they are.
