Immigrant detainees sent home from the UK still face "disproportionate force and restraint" and are subjected to offensive language from their escorts, according to a new report by the Ministry of Justice.
Despite the death of Jimmy Mubenga (pictured) three years ago, when G4S security guards unlawfully killed the 46-yearold after forcefully restraining him prior to take-off on a British Airways flight to Angola, there are still "no recognised safe procedures" for using restraint on board aircraft, the document said.
Mr Mubenga's death led to monitoring of overseas escorts returning detainees to Afghanistan, Ghana, Sri Lanka and Nigeria.
Subsequent findings by the UK National Preventive Mechanism unit, covering April 2012 to March 2013, raised concerns that people were facing abuse from officials in their own country following deportation. But the report added: "On the whole, escort procedures were well organised and escorts dealt with detainees sensitively."
