GIFTED immigrants are being scared away from Britain because of the Government's heavy–handed immigration and visa policies, a group of peers has suggested.
A House of Lords committee warned that the Government's immigration policy is harming Britain's standing on the world stage and said it must urgently be overhauled.
The Coalition's visa reforms, which have been designed to reduce net migration, are damaging the UK, the report states. In the report, the peers called for students to be removed from net migration targets and for a change in tone from the Government in the way it communicates about immigration.
"The Government should be wary of introducing policies that, however inadvertently, undermine the attractiveness of the UK as a place to do business with, visit, study, and learn English in," the report says.
