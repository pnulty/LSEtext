LABOUR has a "huge problem" with the UK Independence Party and should recognise that Nigel Farage is raising "widespread concerns" instead of calling him a racist, one of Ed Miliband's most senior allies has said.
Lord Glasman, the Labour "guru" who was rewarded with a peerage by Mr Miliband, said Mr Farage was not racist in suggesting that he would feel "uncomfortable" if Romanians moved in next door. He added that it was wrong to "abuse" Mr Farage for "saying what he thinks", and that people are "genuinely entitled to feel concerned about immigration".
Lord Glasman told The Daily Telegraph that Ukip appeals to a "sense of dispossession" in the Labour heartlands. He urged Mr Miliband, the Labour leader, to select more candidates from working–class backgrounds who haven't been to university. He also said that Mr Miliband comes across as too "ideological" and "seminary" when he appears on television and suggested that he should learn to speak in a more "straightforward" manner.
Lord Glasman's intervention came after Mr Farage was widely criticised for saying he would be "uncomfortable" if Romanians moved in next door. Mr Miliband described this as a "racial slur". David Cameron, the Prime Minister, said Mr Farage's comments were "pretty unpleasant" but it was for voters to decide whether Ukip is a racist party.
Lord Glasman, however, said that Mr Farage was reflecting a "generalised disquiet" about immigration.
He added: "I think people are very anxious about the scale of change. It doesn't do anybody any favours to stigmatise expressions of anxiety. I don't think he has said anything wrong."
