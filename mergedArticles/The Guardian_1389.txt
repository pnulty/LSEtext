A call by Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, for the government to scrap its target to bring net immigration to tens of thousands, and instead focus on reducing overall numbers of arrivals, has been fended off by the Tory party chairman, Grant Shapps, who said there was still a chance of reaching the net target before the general election.
Although figures last week had net migration at 212,000 and rising, Shapps said huge progress had been made and figures from outside the EU were the lowest for a decade. The Conservative manifesto promised to bring net migration down below 100,000.
Fox believes the net migration target is a nonsense and what matters is the actual number of arrivals since that is what affects schools, housing and health.
Speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr programme Nigel Farage, the UK Independence party leader, pictured below, dismissed Fox's intervention as "baloney" and said the only way to cut migrant numbers was to regain control of UK borders by leaving the EU.
He said: "The reasons the Tories won't win a majority at the next general election is not because of Europe, it's because their own voters don't see David Cameron as a Conservative."
Farage repeated his proposal for an Australian-style work permit system, insisting immigration had to be based on quality as well as quantity. "We can't have any control over who comes to Britain all the while we're members of the European Union and it's as simple as that."
Farage said Ukip would not publish any domestic policies before the European elections, and also claimed Ukip was the low-tax party.
