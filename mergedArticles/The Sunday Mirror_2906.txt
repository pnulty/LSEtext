SECURITY checks have been stepped up at the House of Commons to stop illegal immigrants working there.
The move follows the resignation of Immigration Minister Mark Harper after it emerged that his own cleaner was an illegal.
Officials have now tightened up rules for the hundreds of contractors in Parliament. They face "pre-employment checks", a memo obtained by the Sunday Mirror reveals. Previously, they were not subject to the same checks as permanent staff.
A Whitehall source said: "Can you imagine the embarrassment for the Government and the Home Secretary Theresa May if illegal immigrants were found in Westminster while they are trying to crack down on the problem?" FAKE ID: PAGES 8&9
