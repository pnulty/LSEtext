A “significant” rise in European Unionimmigrants to Britain last year was revealed in official figures published today.
As voters took to the polls in European and local elections, the Office for National Statistics revealed that some 201,000 EU citizens migrated to the UK in the year ending December 2013, a “statistically significant” rise on the 158,000 the previous year.
Meanwhile, overall net migration — the difference between migrants leaving and arriving in the UK — rose to 212,000 in the period, up from 177,000 the previous year.
The headline figures provoked immediate criticisms from Labour and immigration campaign groups that the coalition’s pledge to bring net migration to below 100,000 by next year’s general election was in tatters. The figures also gave a late boost to Nigel Farage’s Eurosceptic Ukip party, which has campaigned almost solely on immigration matters.
Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: “David Cameron and Theresa May’s flagship immigration pledge is in shreds.
“They promised ‘no ifs, no buts’ to get their net migration target down to the tens of thousands by the end of the parliament, and the actual figure is over twice that.”
She added: “Just 18 months ago the home secretary claimed she would meet her target. Just a week ago the prime minister claimed meeting the target was ‘perfectly feasible’. They have no policies to deliver it and the public know there is a huge gap between Tory rhetoric and the reality.”
Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch UK, the campaign group, said: “These new figures confirm that migration from the EU has blown the government off course in meeting its overall target.
“In particular we note that new national insurance numbers issued to Romanian and Bulgarian citizens in the first quarter of this year was 45,000, of whom around 10,000 arrived in that quarter. This suggests that our estimate of a 50,000-a-year increase in the UK population of these citizens will be broadly correct.”
The figures show that some 526,000 people immigrated to the UK in the year ending December, up from the 498,000 people who arrived during the year before, while 314,000 emigrants left the country, down from the 321,000 the previous year.
Some 104,000 citizens of so-called EU15 countries — pre-2004 members of the union — arrived in Britain, up from 85,000 in the previous year.
About 70,000 citizens of the EU8 countries, which joined the EU in 2004 and include Poland, came to Britain in the period, compared with 60,000 in the previous year. And 23,000 citizens of Romanian and Bulgaria arrived in the period, before employment curbs for the two nations were lifted, up from 9,000 previous year.
Non-EU citizens immigrating to the UK dropped to 249,000 in the same period, from 260,000 the previous year which statisticians said was owing to fewer Commonwealth citizens — such as those from India — arriving to study.
Against a backdrop of growing concerns of an influx of Romanians and Bulgarians to Britain, and a surge in popularity for Ukip, the prime minister last year rushed through a series of tough measures to curb “abuse” of free movement between EU member states.
Today James Brokenshire, the immigration and security minister, said: “Uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on our public services and forces down wages for people on low incomes.
“While recent net migration levels remain stable, the figures show that it has fallen by a third since its peak in 2005 under the last government and that this government’s reforms have cut net migration from outside the EU to levels not seen since the late 1990s.
“We are building an immigration system that is fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants and tough on those who abuse the system or flout the law. We want to ensure that people come to the UK for the right reasons — to work hard and contribute to our economy and society.”
Mark Hilton, head of immigration policy at London First, an independent business membership organisation, accused the Government of “hypocrisy” over its immigration target. He said: “Again we’ve been shown it’s EU migrants that are driving immigration numbers and there’s nothing we can do about that.”
The number of Romanian and Bulgarians applying for national insurance rose to 65,000 in the year to March, from 35,000 the previous year, according to the new figures, but only 22 per cent applied since labour market restrictions were lifted in January.
Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: “Despite the government’s best efforts and repeated commitments to reducing the net migration figure it has remained the same. Controlling EU migration is impossible without reform. It is clear that their aim is unrealistic and unachievable. The government should drop their target now.”
