Philip Seymour Hoffman plays German counter-terrorism expert Gunter Bachmann in the film adaptation of John Le Carre's thriller
The full trailer for one of Philip Seymour Hoffman's final films, A Most Wanted Man, has been released.
Based on John Le Carré's 2008 novel, the film finds Hoffman playing rogue German counter-terrorism expert Gunter Bachmann. He’s trying to track down half-Chechen, half-Russian immigrant Issa Karpov (Grigoriy Dobrygin), who is thought to be part of a militant jihadist group in post-9/11 Hamburg.

The film, directed by Anton Corbijn (Control, The American), features a terrific cast, including Willem Dafoe, Robin Wright, Nina Hoss, Franz Hartwig, Kostja Ullman, Rainer Bock, Charlotte Schwab, Max Volkert Martens, Martin Wuttke and Turkish actress Derya Alabora.
The Oscar-winning Hoffman, who died from a drug overdose in February, has a few projects set to come out. In addition to this and the final two Hunger Games movies, which will be his last, he will appear in God's Pocket, the directorial debut of Mad Men's John Slattery. The film sees Hoffman play Mickey, a man living in the gritty, blue-collar Philadelphia neighbourhood of God’s Pocket, who finds himself in trouble after his stepson dies in a suspicious accident.
A Most Wanted Man is yet to have a UK release date confirmed.
