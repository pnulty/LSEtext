FED-UP airline passengers across Britain last night faced longer queues at immigration desks after an IT glitch.
Extra staff were drafted in after a fault on Border Force computers yesterday afternoon.
Non-EU passengers were worst affected. A Heathrow airport spokesman said: 'Obviously, we want to sort the issue out but not risk the integrity of the border controls.' A Birmingham Airport spokesman added: 'We are aware of the fault and the impact it is having at the moment. It appears to be getting progressively worse but we are hoping it will be sorted out soon.' Passengers said they had been told to wait for several hours as staff battled to overcome the problem.
