Access to the controversial Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre was denied to UN human rights investigator Rashida Manjoo on Monday, she has claimed.
Ms Manjoo said she was refused entry to Yarl's Wood despite being given the go-ahead by the Prisons Inspectorate and being accompanied by one of their staff - saying the "disturbing" decision to deny her access had come from the "highest levels" of the Home Office.
Ms Manjoo said she had wanted to verify alleged human rights violations of the women detainees, after Christine Case, a 40-year-old Jamaican, died in the centre last month having suffered from what is thought to have been a heart attack.
Ms Manjoo said it was incumbent on the UK to provide "unrestricted access". But a spokeswoman for the Home Office said: "A tour of Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre was never agreed."
