As more Brits bid adios to Spain, we seek new destinations for the expat dream
For us Brits, it’s been the equivalent of a property Dunkirk. For years, we have been happily sending out thousands of citizens to start a new life in Spain – about 760,000 sun-seekers have moved there since 1995. All of a sudden, though, the economic sun has gone behind the clouds and our bucket-and-spade brigades are withdrawing at an alarming rate. According to official figures, some 90,000 of us have forsaken the costas and returned to these shores.
The news has sent the nation rushing to our atlases to seek out new spots in which to settle. It’s estimated that between 4.5 and 4.7 million British citizens live abroad for at least part of the year.
Question is, when the world is your oyster, how do you find a place to live that is a genuine pearl? Here are some suggestions…
AUSTRALIA
Estimated number of expat Brits 1.1 to 1.2 million.
Most popular areas Sydney, Melbourne, Perth.
Property prices In Sydney you pay £550,000 for a three-bed hou>se; in Perth you pay the same for a four-bed house with sea views.
Flight time to UK 20 hrs 45mins (from Sydney)
Climate Sydney averages 26C (78F) and 16C (60F) in summer and winter; Perth 31C (87F) and 18C (64F).
Cost of a pint of beer 6.5 Australian dollars (£3.60).
Cost of restaurant meal 40 Australian dollars (£22).
The good points Australia tops the NatWest International Personal Banking quality of life survey (it’s been in the top three since 2009). You’ll still get your UK pension, too, albeit frozen from when you arrive.
Not-so-good points More British expats than any other country in the world.
What you’d miss about the UK Understatement.
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Estimated expat Brits 829,000.
Most popular areas There’s a smattering of us in the big cities, but we’re at our most concentrated in Florida. One study says more Brits migrate to the US than from any other nation. Legally, that is.
Property prices In Florida, you can get a humble one-bed condominium apartment for £25-£40,000, or an up-market four-bedroom villa for under £250,000.
Flight time to UK 11 hours from the West Coast, seven hours from the East.
Climate Average minimum 16.7C (62F), average maximum 28C (82F). Orlando has 107 days per year where temperatures are 32C (89F) or more.
Cost of a pint of beer $3.82 (£2.27).
Cost of restaurant meal $30 (£17).
The good points Big portions, big country, year-round warmth (that’s why they call Florida the sunshine state – or is it the orange juice state?).
Not-so-good points If you’re working, you get very little holiday per year (nine-10 days), and the cost of health insurance is enough to make you feel quite ill.
What you’d miss Pessimism.
CANADA
Estimated expat Brits 609,000.
Most popular areas Nova Scotia is only 5hrs 40mins away by air, and has just 10 people per square mile (New York has 1,800).
Property prices For £260,000 you can buy a house with 10 acres of land, and for £100,000 you can buy a three-bed bungalow with five acres.
Flight time to UK Six hours from its east coast, nine hours from its west.
Climate Huge variations – everything from Arctic to chilly to pleasant.
Cost of a pint of beer 5 Canadian dollars (£2.70).
Cost of restaurant meal 15-35 Canadian dollars (£8-£19).
The good points Canada is keen to welcome immigrants, and wants 15,000 new ones this year. It’s also not quite as relentlessly American as America.
Not-so-good points Long distances between cities; the necessity of speaking French.
What you’d miss Everything coming to a halt for snow.
NEW ZEALAND
Estimated expat Brits 250,000.
Most popular areas The east coast of North Island, for example Whakatane and Waiheke Island, a ferry ride from Auckland.
Property prices £200,000 for a three-bed beachside home on the Bay of Plenty in Whakatane; £500,000 for a grander, ocean-front property out of town.
Flight time to UK 23 hours.
Climate Warm sub-tropical in the north (average annual temperature 16C/60F), cool temperate in the south (10C/50F); mild, rather than extreme.
Cost of a pint of beer 7 NZ dollars (£3.50).
Cost of restaurant meal 40 NZ dollars (£20).
The good points Lush, green meadows and lots of lamb, with bonus of sea being close to hand. A recent NZ Immigration Service survey found 88 per cent of Brits feel settled in their new home.
Not-so-good points The feeling you’re in a smaller and somewhat more old-fashioned version of Britain.
What you’d miss Popping across the water (it’s 1,300 miles to Australia).
SOUTH AFRICA
Estimated expat Brits 219,000.
Most popular areas Cape Town, Clifton, Camps Bay.
Property prices A three-bedroom, sea-view house in a gated community overlooking Hout Bay (outside Cape Town) costs around £500,000.
Flight time to UK 11hrs 45mins (Cape Town).
Climate Very dry – average rainfall 466mm, as against world average of 860mm. Average summer temperatures 26C (78F ); winter 5C (41F).
Cost of a pint of beer 18 Rand (£1).
Cost of restaurant meal 350 Rand (£19.50).
The good points Sunshine, beaches, beautiful scenery, safaris.
Not-so-good points It’s wise to drive with your car doors locked.
What you’d miss Constantly rising house prices; although starting to go up, the average price in South Africa is 18.5 per cent cheaper than at its 2007 peak.
GERMANY
Estimated expat Brits A surprisingly large 140,000.
Most popular areas Berlin, Hamburg, Munich.
Property prices In Berlin, you can buy a one-bed apartment for £130,000, or an entire, 43-apartment block for £3million.
Flight time to UK One hour 45 mins.
Climate It’s leather shorts weather in summer, but consistently cold in winter.
Cost of a pint of beer €3 (£2.50).
Cost of restaurant meal €20 (£16.50).
The good points There’s the same brisk, no-nonsense approach that’s common to all northern European countries.
Not-so-good points Sometimes the briskness can become brusqueness.
What you’d miss Brown English bitter, rather than luminous yellow lager.
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
Estimated expat Brits 100,000.
Most popular areas Dubai, Abu Dhabi.
Property prices In Dubai, a three-bed apartment on the frond-shaped, waterfront Palm Jumeirah development costs £530,000; a four-bed villa £2.5m. With staff accommodation, naturally.
Flight time to UK Seven hours.
Climate 36C (96F) in August and 19C (65F) in January, the coldest month.
Cost of a pint of beer 30 AED (£4.85); only available in bars, not shops.
Cost of restaurant meal 75 AED (£12).
The good points You won’t feel like a foreigner: it’s reported that 83.5 per cent of people living in the UAE aren’t locals.
Not-so-good points The heat is not so much your friend, as your enemy. Life isn’t worth living without air-conditioning.
What you’d miss Autumnal mists, cold, leaves on the line in the Dorking area.
TURKEY
Estimated expat Brits 40,000-50,000.
Most popular areas Urban Istanbul, seaside towns Altinkum, Side and Kalkan.
Property prices From £30,000 for two-bed sea-view apartment, up to £250,000 for three-bed sea-view villa. In Istanbul, small new apartments cost £48,000 and Bosphorus-view boutique flats £500.000.
Flight time to UK From 3.5 to 4 hours.
Climate Average temperature 25-35C.
Cost of a pint of beer 6 Turkish lira (£1.70).
Cost of three-course restaurant meal 40 lira (£12).
The good points Turkish lira monthly account pays 10.5 per cent interest.
Not-so-good points The language is quite tricky. Learn it, though (many don’t), and you’ll be popular.
What you’d miss Cricket; the sound of village church bells.
BARBADOS
Estimated expat Brits 5,000. Eighty per cent of overseas buyers are from the UK.
Most popular areas Developments on the Platinum Coast.
Property prices Homes on the plush, British-owned Royal Westmoreland Estate cost from £235,000 for an apartment, and £592,000 for a villa.
Flight time to UK 8hrs 15 mins.
Climate 3,000 hours of sunshine a year, with average temperatures of 30C (86F).
Cost of a pint of beer 4 Barbadian dollars (£1.20).
Cost of restaurant meal 60 dollars (£18).
The good points Brits make up the biggest expat community on Barbados (including Cliff Richard, Simon Cowell, Cilla Black). Cars drive on the left.
Not-so-good points Not all Barbados is in the Caribbean; the east side of the island is hilly and in the less placid Atlantic. Hurricane season is June to November.
What you’d miss Long drives – the island is only 21 miles long by 14 miles wide. And living on a normal street, rather than in a gated development.
ALBANIA
Estimated expat Brits Few, but rising.
Most popular areas The coast (a 40-minute drive from the capital Tirana).
Property prices for £30,000 you can buy an apartment (for £190,000, a villa) on the new, sandy-beach development at Lalzit Bay, with health club and palm trees imported from Malaysia.
Flight time to UK Three hours (British Airways).
Climate Mediterranean (it’s the same landmass as Greece).
Cost of a pint of beer 170 lek (£1).
Cost of restaurant meal Seafood, spaghetti and a bottle of red wine for 1200 lek (£7).
The good points The crackpot, isolationist Communist regime was toppled in 1991. And Albanians are happy to welcome Brits (we’re still a novelty).
Not-so-good points Queries over ownership of title deeds on older properties.
What you’d miss The English language. In Albanian, mirupafshim means thank you, and berxolla vici is a veal chop.
