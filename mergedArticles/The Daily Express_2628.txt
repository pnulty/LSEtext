DAVID CAMERON was at his serious best in Israel, looking and sounding like a statesman. He should now stay like that and forget selfies, positive discrimination, image, Twitter, gay marriage, wind turbines and all the other nonsense he has embraced in the name of "rebranding" and "detoxifying" the Conservative Party, which after all has hardly flourished under his direction with membership at an all-time low.
Unfortunately it seems that he is now intent on messing about with the Hunting Act when the rest of the country is preoccupied with the aftermath of the floods, the struggle to buy a house and the effects of rampant immigration.
If he persists in this madness then expect Ukip to have the last laugh.
