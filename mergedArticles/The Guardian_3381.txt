I buy the Saturday Guardian and take all week to read it. Sport usually goes straight in the recycling, but as a writer with an interest in human rights, immigration, community living and children's literature, my favourite stories could be hidden in any of the other sections. An article in the old Money section changed my life. It was about co-housing and featured a development in Stroud. My family and I visited and were so impressed that we are planning to build our own co-housing development in inner-city Leeds.
I've worked with asylum seekers and refugees for over seven years, and give lectures on the misrepresentation of immigration in the press. That's why I appreciate how the Guardian challenges the powerful and sticks up for those who can so easily become scapegoats for failures in government policy around housing, employment, education or health. For example, earlier this year the National Audit Office published a report which the Guardian headlined: G4S and Serco failing to house asylum seekers properly. It wasn't long before some papers found a different angle and instead of highlighting the government and corporate waste and incompetence chose to vilify asylum seekers and foster further hostility and misunderstanding.
