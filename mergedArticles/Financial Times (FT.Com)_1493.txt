From Dr Michael Cross.
Sir, With reference to "UK should scrap its migrant targets" (editorial, March 8): much has been said about the potentially negative impact of immigrants on UK society. This reminds me of Herbert Loebl, who came to the UK in 1938 and, in 1951, co-founded Joyce, Loebl, a scientific instrument maker, in the northeast. The company went on to employ 500 people by the time it was sold, and spawned 45 businesses both in the region and beyond.
There are many other cases of such positive contributions that immigrants make to UK society and to the economy. Perhaps we should reflect on the impact of not accepting and welcoming such immigrants as Dr Loebl, who sadly died last year.
