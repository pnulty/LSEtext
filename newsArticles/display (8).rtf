In some cities, it is thought around half of care workers are foreign nationals.\par \par \uc2 Dr Shereen Hussein, scientific adviser to the Department of Health, said changes to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy and the relaxation of EU labour rules has altered the profile of migrants who work as carers in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Many agencies do not adequately test language skills during interviews \u8211\'20\'13 leading to risks that the elderly could become victims of \u8216\'20\'18bad treatment\u8217\'20\'19, she said.\par \par \uc2 While migrants from outside the \uc2 European Union\uc2  are subject to rigorous language tests, this is not the case for those who come from within it.\par \par \uc2 More and more care workers are now from EU accession countries such as Poland and Hungary, where no language testing is required.\par \par \uc2 Dr Hussein told the BBC: \u8216\'20\'18This means new migrants can be vulnerable when they\u8217\'20\'19re placed in people\u8217\'20\'19s homes \u8211\'20\'13 and carers have reported instances of racism and discrimination that stem from communication problems.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It would be really beneficial to have a standard interview process to establish English language proficiency, communication skills and softer skills of all care workers aiming to work in the sector.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18At the moment, vulnerable workers are placed in the homes of vulnerable adults with complex needs, and sometimes communication problems can result in bad treatment for both parties.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 One man, who wishes to remain anonymous, has a 62-year-old brother with a severe form of dementia. He employed carers for 18 months to oversee the care of his brother, but grew frustrated with the quality of the staff.\par \par \uc2 He told 5 Live Breakfast the situation grew so problematic he took the decision to put his brother in a care home.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18The dynamic between the carers and a frightened man who was suffering with dementia didn\u8217\'20\'19t work most of the time,\u8217\'20\'19 he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Almost all the carers were from overseas, mainly from Poland. I found some of them exceptionally difficult to understand, which meant my brother, in his condition, was never going to understand them and the reaction from him was to hide or get slightly violent.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Dr Hussein, of King\u8217\'20\'19s College London\u8217\'20\'19s social care workforce research unit, added: \u8216\'20\'18In the majority, migrant workers are very hard-working, but sometimes when their English language is quite poor, that can put both carers and the user in very vulnerable situations \u8211\'20\'13 especially if they are the only carer.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Interview standards are variable. We heard from care workers who admitted that their English is not very good, and the interview process is quite easy.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Under Brussels right to freedom of movement rules, it would be considered a breach to prevent someone taking a job on the basis of their language alone.\par \par \uc2 The BBC spoke to some former care workers from Hungary, who told of their struggles to communicate with clients.\par \par \uc2 Hajnalka Deak, who came to the UK in 2008, said: \u8216\'20\'18To do the job you have to understand the doctor\u8217\'20\'19s instructions, report to relatives and speak to agencies.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18You have to help clients do things they can\u8217\'20\'19t do for themselves, and it\u8217\'20\'19s essential to understand their instructions.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I remember once I worked with a wheelchair user. I had to strap him in the car. Unfortunately I couldn\u8217\'20\'19t understand the exact instructions and we had to stay at home and couldn\u8217\'20\'19t go anywhere. I felt partly embarrassed and partly frustrated.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 But Colin Angel, of the UK Home Care Association, which represents care agencies, said there was not enough money for language training because of council cuts.\par \par \uc2 The Government is bringing in a new \u8216\'20\'18care certificate\u8217\'20\'19 to ensure carers have the necessary skills.\par \par \uc2 Care minister Norman Lamb added: \u8216\'20\'18Employers are responsible for recruiting staff who can competently speak and read English but communication will be a key part of the Care Certificate.'\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140507ea570070y\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 'We need more tiger-parents to push pupils': Expert says British are falling behind East Asian children because parents think ability is inherited rather than result of hard work\b0\par\par\uc2 LAURA CLARK   \par \uc2 582 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 May 2014\par 01:43\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

That has a big impact on attitudes.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 His remarks raise the prospect of a rise in \u8216\'20\'18tiger mothers\u8217\'20\'19 such as Amy Chua, who described how she chivvied her two daughters to academic success Chinese-style in a best-selling book which provoked fierce debate in Britain.\par \par \uc2 Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, published in 2011, was described by the US law professor, whose\u160\'00\'A0 parents were \u8216\'20\'18very strict, Chinese \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  parents\u8217\'20\'19 as \u8216\'20\'18the story\u160\'00\'A0 of my family\u8217\'20\'19s journey in\u160\'00\'A0 two cultures\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Sir Michael made his remarks as the UK came sixth in an international league table of education systems, behind South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong.\par \par \uc2 He said parental expectation in those Asian countries was \u8216\'20\'18very high\u8217\'20\'19, with mothers and fathers spending \u8216\'20\'18long evenings\u8217\'20\'19 helping their children with homework.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18There is a contrast between those attitudes and here, where some parents don\u8217\'20\'19t exert that kind of pressure for achievement, don\u8217\'20\'19t expect effort to be rewarded and do think that either their child is really clever or isn\u8217\'20\'19t \u8211\'20\'13 and sometimes reinforce that in a way that is unhelpful,\u8217\'20\'19 he added.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Overall, there is a contrast that is deeply embedded in cultures.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18The rise of Pacific Asian countries, which combine effective\u160\'00\'A0 education systems with a culture that prizes effort above inherited \u8220\'20\'1Csmartness\u8221\'20\'1D, is a phenomenon\u160\'00\'A0 that other countries can no\u160\'00\'A0 longer ignore.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Britain\u8217\'20\'19s position in the latest Global Index of Cognitive Skills and Attainment, published by Pearson and compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit, remains unchanged since the rankings were last produced, in 2012.\par \par \uc2 East Asian countries tightened their grip at the top of the table featuring 39 nations, while Finland slipped to fifth. A report accompanying the index found that \u8216\'20\'18parental expectations have a measurable impact on student motivation\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Sir Michael said the message needed to be \u8216\'20\'18spelled out\u8217\'20\'19 that there were risks associated with failing to gain a good education.\par \par \uc2 He added: \u8216\'20\'18Changing culture is\u160\'00\'A0 an extremely difficult thing\u160\'00\'A0 to attempt.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It is something that everybody involved in education needs to\u160\'00\'A0 contribute to \u8211\'20\'13 it\u8217\'20\'19s not a job just\u160\'00\'A0 for government.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18The way schools relate to\u160\'00\'A0 parents about their individual child is really important. That\u8217\'20\'19s an area where you can significantly change culture.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18But in the end, it is about\u160\'00\'A0 communicating with people about how different the 21st century\u160\'00\'A0 is going to be from when they went to school.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140508ea5800005\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Transplant patient overwhelmed by i readers' response to his plight\b0\par\par\uc2 By Cahal Milmo CHIEF REPORTER   \par \uc2 338 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 May 2014\par \uc2 i\par \uc2 IIND\par \uc2 1ST\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd.

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News | Kidney-transplant patient championed by The Independent prepares for surgery\par \par \uc2 A kidney-transplant patient whose sister was refused a visa to become his donor has spoken of his elation and humility at the public response to his case as final preparations are made for his life-changing operation.\par \par \uc2 Oliver Cameron, 38, was told last month that his sister, Keisha Rushton, can travel from her home in Jamaica to donate a kidney after The Independent highlighted his predicament and the Home Office minister James Brokenshire subsequently overturned the earlier refusal by his officials to allow her to enter Britain.\par \par \uc2 The case made headlines around the world and provoked calls from politicians, religious leaders and campaign groups for the authorities to reconsider, as well as an online petition signed by hundreds demanding a reversal of officials' draconian stance.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron, who must undergo gruelling dialysis three times a day, said that he was grateful for the high-level support but added he had been most affected by the messages and help he has received from ordinary people, including the many readers of The Independent who made offers of financial help after he found he could no longer afford his sister's air fare.\par \par \uc2 He said: "The response was simply overwhelming and it filled me with such gratitude and faith that there are plenty of people out there who care, are decent and want to help. I cannot express how grateful I am for the manner in which people have responded. It has been genuinely humbling."\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron, a father-of-four who learnt he needed a kidney transplant after suffering near-fatal renal failure in December 2012, is now entering the final stage of tests at the Royal Free Hospital in north London ahead of undergoing the procedure in the coming weeks.\par \par \uc2 His sister, who arrived in Britain three weeks ago, had been told last year that she was being refused the temporary visa to allow her to make good on her promise to donate a kidney to her brother because \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  officials were not satisfied she would return to Jamaica.\par \par \uc2 In a letter signed anonymously by "Entry Clearance Officer 5", the self-employed hairdresser was told that consideration had been given to the "compassionate aspects" of her case but the authorities were not satisfied "that you genuinely intend a short visit".\par \par \uc2 Ms Rushton cares for her elderly mother and has left six of her seven children in Jamaica while she undergoes treatment to save her brother in London. She said: "After all the struggle I'm just happy to be here to have this opportunity to do something for my brother. He's my brother and it really means so much that, thanks to the help of people out there who read about our case, I can do this thing."\par \par \uc2 The brother and sister, who were already identified as a match prior to Ms Rushton first applying for a visa last summer, have been undergoing a series of tests to ensure the best chance of success for the transplant.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron, from Stoke Newington, north London, had originally been scheduled to undergo the operation last autumn and has suffered complications, including problems with one of his eyes, since the postponement.\par \par \uc2 He said: "I think we would both like to get on now and complete the operation. But we must be patient and wait our turn. It has been a long, hard journey and we're nearly there."\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140508ea580002a\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 British patients put at risk by care workers with poor grasp of English\b0\par\par\uc2 By Sarah O\u8217\'20\'19Grady   \par \uc2 334 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 May 2014\par 03:16\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 FOREIGN care workers should sit compulsory tests to make sure they have an adequate command of English, the Government was told yesterday.\par \par \uc2 Poor language skills could lead to bad treatment and even abuse as elderly patients struggle to make themselves understood, said Dr Shereen Hussein, a scientific adviser to the Department of Health.\par \par \uc2 To have people who cannot speak, read or write even basic English in charge of medication and with a res\u173\'00\'ADponsibility to follow medical instructions is a recipe for disaster, she said.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  from countries outside of Europe such as Pakistan and India already have to prove they can speak English before they settle here, but those from the EU do not.\par \par \uc2 Dr Hussein, of King\u8217\'20\'19s College London\u8217\'20\'19s Social Care Workforce Research Unit, is now calling on agencies who recruit people as carers to make sure staff can speak English. She said: \u8220\'20\'1CWorkers are placed in the homes of vulnerable adults with complex needs and communication problems can result in bad treatment.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 There are currently 1.2 million care workers in England and 204,000 of them are foreign. From March 2015, care workers will be expected to hold a certificate showing they have been properly trained \u8211\'20\'13 but English ability is not included.\par \par \uc2 Alp Mehmet, of MigrationWatch, said: \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a no-brainer that people working here should be able to speak our language. It is just common sense.\u8221\'20\'1D Care Minister Norman Lamb said: \u8220\'20\'1CFor people to get the care they want they need to be able to communicate.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ukip last night said not just care staff but all EU migrants should take a language test.

Innate kindness, patience and empathy are important but these qualities cannot be taught.\par \par \uc2 Another is the ability to communicate with the people who are being looked after. Communication can include a touch or a smile but it must also mean speaking the same language.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 There is nothing more frustrating for the carer or the person in their care if neither can understand what the other is saying. It can lead to frustration, to anger and even to abuse. It is a particularly acute problem if the patient is suffering from dementia.\par \par \uc2 Many carers working here today are migrants, doing the essential and not-very-well-paid jobs that sadly many Britons have no wish to do. Many are splendid and the caring professions could not function without them.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 But it is right that the issue of poor language skills has been highlighted and that proficiency in English should be part of the new \u8220\'20\'1Ccare certificate\u8221\'20\'1D. This would be a guarantee for employers and patients that healthcare assistants and support workers have all the necessary skills.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 As Dr Shereen Hussein, adviser to the Department of Health, outlines, ability in English can be tested through a simple interview process.

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 In the run-up to the European elections the Financial Times is running a series on the continent's New Populists - Europe's Tea Parties. But this column feels these groups, the likes of France's Front National, the UK Independence party and Greece's Golden Dawn, have been hogging the limelight.\par \par \uc2 So to restore some balance the rest of this article will focus on the New Unpopulists: Europe's \uc2 Tupperware\uc2  parties. The Tea Parties feel angry and abandoned by the political class and want fresh policies. \uc2 Tupperware\uc2  parties offer more of the same but kept fresh by a presentational outer shell of plastic platitudes.\par \par \uc2 The uniting feature of the New Unpopulists is that many of them were once quite popular but are now not popular at all. Some angered voters with wildly unpopular policies such as rescuing their country's crisis-hit economy, nearly rescuing their country's crisis-hit economy, or being ready to consider some tough choices that might one day rescue their country's crisis-hit economy.\par \par \uc2 Since the key to being popular is staying out of power, and the key to losing popularity is winning power, the New Populists aim for a series of moral victories they can portray as stunning upsets but do not result in them actually having to govern. Their ideal people's revolt storms the gates of parliament but is then kept waiting in reception. By contrast the New Unpopulists (slogan: "Blue skies are just around the corner") are content with moral defeats that leave them in power.\par \par \uc2 Europe's New Populists (slogan: "Romanians are just around the corner") generally have one very charismatic leader who pulls the party forward; again, by contrast, the unpopulists tend to prefer one uncharismatic leader who holds them back. Sometimes, unpopulist parties court popularity by choosing populist leaders such as Nicolas Sarkozy, Tony Blair or Matteo Renzi. But this can be a double-edged sword because unpopulist parties do not like it when those leaders actually do things that might be popular.\par \par \uc2 In France, the leader of the New Unpopulists is Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Hollande, whose Socialists look set to suffer a hefty defeat in this month's poll. In an effort to boost his unpopulist party he has appointed a populist prime minister, Manuel Valls. But, although Mr Valls has shown some populist touches such as being beastly to \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , he has also adopted the unpopulist position of being one himself, which muddies the message.\par \par \uc2 The New Unpopulists have the New Populists worried. Europe's far right and hard left are now warning that unpopular moderate parties could mop up two-thirds of the votes in this month's elections, leaving unpopulists in control of the Strasbourg parliament even though the New Populists secured a larger minority of the votes than last time.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the Old Unpopulists, the New Unpopulists - who upon close inspection turn out to be the same as the Old Unpopulists - are rising to the challenge with populist rhetoric. This has led to warnings from the New Populists that, in spite of attempts to disguise it, many of the New Unpopulists do not really hate foreigners. New Populists have been sifting the public statements and tweets of the Liberal grouping in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  looking to catch them saying something nice about other nations. In Britain, Liberal Democrats were forced to disown a local councillor for once hiring a French polisher. Meanwhile Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, tried to shed his party's image by stressing that some of his best friends aren't foreigners. Others, including Britain's Conservatives, reject the populists' crude xenophobia but stand ready to be mean to \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  on a case-by-case basis.\par \par \uc2 The rise of the New Populists has left the New Unpopulists fighting to be the less unpopular. At present, the centre-right seems to have the edge, which may point to a new role for Jean-Claude Juncker, who after 18 years as Old Unpopulist premier of Luxembourg has emerged as the New Unpopulist choice for president of the European Commission - a role not to be confused with president of the European Council, which is currently held by the equally unpopulist Herman Van Rompuy.\par \par \uc2 It was Mr Juncker who once spelt out the core unpopulist philosophy when he noted during the economic crisis: "We all know what to do; we just don't know how to get re-elected after we've done it." Now it is more like: "We know what to do but would rather leave it till after we've been re-elected." Most voters are expected to abstain.\par \par \uc2 robert.shrimsley@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140508ea5800027\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Ukip, a song and dance act\par \par \uc2 Ukip has finally made the big league with a musical written about its campaign. Not, alas, by \uc2 Sir Tim Rice\uc2 , a former donor, but by Richard Ng, a student at Brasenose College, Oxford, David Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s alma mater. Ukip: The Musical will have its premiere next week with a view to taking it to the Edinburgh Fringe.\par \par \uc2 The plot, about a \u8220\'20\'1Cnormal British worker who finds herself at the centre of an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  conspiracy\u8221\'20\'1D, is witty, poking fun at stories that claim \u8220\'20\'1C50 per cent of gays are communists\u8221\'20\'1D based on a survey of two people and raising fears of foreigners stealing 3,000 years of British sleep every night.\par \par \uc2 The songs are very good too, with a rousing finale after Ukip triumph to the tune of Do You Hear the People Sing? from Les Mis. It ends: \u8220\'20\'1CThanks to us the EU\u8217\'20\'19s gone. Thanks to us Britain is great. Look how much you can achieve on a message of hate!\u8221\'20\'1D Wonder if Nige has tickets.\par \par \uc2 Lewinsky\u8217\'20\'19s lament\par \par \uc2 Beyonc\u233\'00\'E9, the American singer, has managed to annoy Monica Lewinsky, that blast from the 1990s, with a reference to the former White House intern\u8217\'20\'19s infamous affair on her new album. The song Partition has the line \u8220\'20\'1CHe popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse/ He Monica Lewinsky\u8217\'20\'19d all on my gown\u8221\'20\'1D. Thanks a lot, Lewinsky replies. \u8220\'20\'1CBut if we\u8217\'20\'19re verbing, I think you mean \u8216\'20\'18He Bill Clinton\u8217\'20\'19d all on my gown\u8217\'20\'19 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 You have to admire \uc2 Roger Federer\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Swiss efficiency. Four years ago the tennis player\u8217\'20\'19s wife gave birth to twin girls and on Tuesday they had twin boys. \uc2 Ladbrokes\uc2  offered odds of 10,000-1 yesterday against there being a future all-Federer mixed doubles final at Wimbledon. The bookies aren\u8217\'20\'19t stupid, though. They offer only 100-1 against one of them winning the singles title.\par \par \uc2 Cracking shot, sir\par \par \uc2 Steve Hedley, a wannabe leader of the RMT, attempted to impress the comrades by posting a photo of himself in a Soviet fur hat with hammer and sickle badge holding what he no doubt thought was an AK-47, gun of choice for all self-respecting Marxist revolutionaries. No one can fool a Times reader on military hardware, though. Rupert Edis writes to observe that it was actually a German MP44, used by the Waffen SS. \u8220\'20\'1CIs this the image he really wished to project?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 After I reported the National Trust\u8217\'20\'19s warning that any unattended children at a house in Devon will be given an espresso and promised a puppy, Colin Forbes emails to say that the Daneway Inn near Cirencester has a blunter sign: \u8220\'20\'1CAny unattended children will be sold.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 With armful intent\par \par \uc2 BBC staff were surprised to see a Hollywood star queuing outside Broadcasting House recently for a radio recording of missing episodes from Hancock\u8217\'20\'19s Half Hour. Who knew that Kiefer Sutherland was a fan of Galton and Simpson\u8217\'20\'19s curmudgeonly antihero?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou\u8217\'20\'19re not on the VIP list,\u8221\'20\'1D staff told Sutherland, but he\u8217\'20\'19d applied for public tickets. Here\u8217\'20\'19s hoping that the new series of 24, which is set in London, has a scene in which Jack Bauer, Sutherland\u8217\'20\'19s terrorist-hunter, growls Hancock\u8217\'20\'19s immortal line from The Blood Donor: \u8220\'20\'1CDammit Chloe, a pint?

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The home secretary, Theresa May, has won backing for her controversial plan to strip naturalised British terror suspects of their UK passports after it was revised following last-minute negotiations with the Liberal Democrats.\par \par \uc2 The details were revealed in a leaked letter to Lib Dem MPs from Home Office minister Norman Baker, who pleaded with them not to vote against the revised package despite concerns that it would leave people stateless. "If colleagues really feel uncomfortable, and I hope you now don't, then I would ask you to abstain," he told them.\par \par \uc2 In the letter leaked to the Spectator website, Baker told his colleagues that he shared the view that there was a point of principle at stake but argued that new safeguards represented "a major shift from the home secretary".\par \par \uc2 The two new safeguards will mean that the home secretary will not be able to take away British citizenship from somebody they "reasonably believe" will be unable to secure an alternative passport from another country.\par \par \uc2 The concessions were enough to secure May a 66-strong majority when the Commons voted to overturn a Lords amendment to the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  bill. Only one Lib Dem MP, Sarah Teather, and two Conservatives, Richard Shepherd and David Davis, voted against the government.

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Features Pages\par \b \uc2 G2: Jeremy Clarkson is not a maverick - he is the bullying face of the establishment\b0\par\par\uc2 Suzanne Moore   \par \uc2 960 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 What a relief that an overwhelmingly white institution - the BBC - has decided that Jeremy Clarkon isn't racist, and that he mustn't be again. Now at long last we can all go around insulting women, disabled people, gay people, greens, as is our birthright. That's a lesson learned. Political correctness gone mad. That old conker. Except conkers have been banned by lesbians. Or something. Clarkson once again flaunts his crusade - the poor silenced lamb - with columns in the the Sun and the Sunday Times, making his usual jokes about how he must now eat lentils and not goose Mary Beard in the lift. Laugh? I almost spat in the face of the pathetic BBC who won't let go of a cash cow, so will tolerate language that no state school in the land does.\par \par \uc2 The Clarkson row is about something much bigger than his right to offend, which is why we need our public institutions to get with the programme. The inane discussion about whether Clarkson is personally racist is a side-show. He works within an institution that will clearly permit racist crap as laddish banter. Never mind the N-word; "slope" was vile. Oh, he didn't know that it was nasty? Look, he's my age. I wager he has seen as many Vietnam war movies as I have. Or even that little-known film called Pulp Fiction, in which Christopher Walken gives a virtuoso performance as Captain Koons, with a deranged rant about hiding his watch from evil "yellow slopes". This is what the Americans called unarmed Vietnamese as they killed them. I am referring to a movie, to pop culture, because this is the place where things change, where language morphs long before policy reflects it. This is part of the context in which a Clarkson tells it like it is; as is the rise of Ukip, a party of people mostly without the charm or brains of a Top Gear presenter.\par \par \uc2 Yes I do mean that. Clarkson is not stupid. Nor is he a maverick or outlier. He is a central part of the establishment. He parties with Cameron. Just as Ukip is not a maverick party, but made up of disgruntled Tories; just as Boris Johnson is not a maverick but a born-to-rule chancer; just as bloggers such as Guido Fawkes pretend to be anti-politics mavericks but are hard-rightwingers - this section of the right deludes itself that it is somehow "outside" the establishment rather than its pumping heart.\par \par \uc2 Saying the unsayable is actually dully conformist. Pick on anyone different and mock them. Endeavour to take away not just their rights but the concept that they ever had rights in the first place. All this is done preeningly, while a white middle-aged man pretends he is downtrodden and now some kind of freedom fighter.\par \par \uc2 It works. But let's look at the targets for the combined venom of these "mavericks". Lesbians, gay men, \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , disabled people, vegetarians, people who are concerned about climate change, women generally, women who work in particular. Is it any wonder that a Conservative government should bring with it this culture that is recoiling from social gains made over the past 20 years? The refusal to embrace modernity is seen most clearly in the resistance to equal marriage. It is there in the refusal to accept that structural racism exists. It is emboldened enough now for some Ukip members to be vocal about turning back women's rights.\par \par \uc2 This part of the establishment seeks not only to put a brake on social progress, but to go backwards. This backlash has to be understood to be confronted. This is about race and a whole lot more. It is about a set of attitudes that never went away but are now sold as "what people really think". Sure, some people do really think this. They feel let down and confused by rapid social change. Others, though, can see how change has happened (how attitudes, for instance, to homosexuality have changed) and feel this to be positive. Signs of the new world are a beacon for some, a warning for others. This is not simply left versus right, but progressives versus conservatives. Labour voters can often be socially conservative, which is what Ukip is playing to.\par \par \uc2 What is asked of Clarkson and his posse is no more than we ask of primary-school pupils. Don't name-call. Respect difference. I don't pretend all sorts of stuff doesn't happen outside the classroom, but it is not a bad ideal. Even small children know which discourses are legitimised by the grownups.\par \par \uc2 Clarkson and the grownup schoolboys know also that every shocking remark is shrapnel. It scatters and wounds multiple targets. If you can say nasty stuff about gay people, then why not about black people? Once you voice the idea that women ask for rape and can't have careers, the next stage is to get rid of naggy old human rights because women don't count as human anyway.\par \par \uc2 We have not been conned by Europe, feminism, political correctness or even bloody wind farms. The biggest con of all is that this coalition of "mavericks" is not seen for what it is. The establishment: in bullying, red-faced self-pitying mode. This is the rich and powerful deriding the powerless while pretending to be heroic victims. It is a revolting, sweaty lie. Let them slap each other's back into oblivion. Decent blokes do not monetise their ability to pick on those weaker than them, never mind make entire careers out if it.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140507ea580007b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 'Women concerned about rape should take reasonable care,' says Roger Helmer after furore over comments in 2011 blog\par \par \uc2 Ukip's candidate in the Newark byelection, Roger Helmer, has attempted to clarify his controversial comments on rape, saying no blame should be attached to the victim but women should take reasonable care not to put themselves in danger of the crime \u8211\'20\'13 in the same way that people going on holiday should lock their front door.\par \par \uc2 The 70-year-old politician was cheered by members of the public as he launched Ukip's campaign in the Nottinghamshire seat, which was vacated when former Tory Patrick Mercer resigned due to a lobbying scandal.\par \par \uc2 The furore about some of Helmer's previous remarks on rape and homosexuality appeared to have had little effect on the electorate, as the MEP was approached in the town's marketplace by wellwishers and people wanting to have their photo taken with him.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to the Guardian, Helmer said some of his views, including a blogpost from 2011 suggesting women should bear some responsibility for date rape in some circumstances, have been "outrageously misrepresented".\par \par \uc2 Asked how he would appeal to women voters who might have been offended, he said: "Can I just make a clear statement about this? I take the view that every rapist should be apprehended and tried and convicted and go to jail. There is absolutely no question about that. I do not suggest for a moment that victims carry any blame for the offence.\par \par \uc2 "I'd like to give you an illustration that is less emotive. If you go on holiday and you get burgled, there is absolutely no question the guilt lies with the burglar. But if it so happens that you left your front door unlocked, then your insurer will probably advise you that was unwise.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone who is a potential victim of any crime would be well advised to take reasonable care. I am not at all saying a rape victim is responsible for being raped but I would advise people who might consider themselves at risk to be careful. It doesn't seem to me that's bad advice. It seems to be the advice that any parent would give to a daughter."\par \par \uc2 Asked if he thinks voters agree with some of his controversial comments from the past, he said: "I hope people would agree with the view that women concerned about rape should take reasonable care. If a girl goes and gets drunk in a clubbing area and incapable at two o'clock in the morning and lies on the pavement, it's not her fault, the guilt lies with the rapist.\par \par \uc2 "But the fact that she was there and drunk and incapable made the offence more likely. It seems to me if you say that quietly to somebody and they think about it, they say: 'It's obvious,' so why is it contentious'?"\par \par \uc2 Helmer said one of the things people like about Ukip is "authenticity" and that its politicians say what they think. But he stressed: "As a party, and I as an individual, absolutely condemn prejudice, discrimination, hostility and especially violence against minority groups."\par \par \uc2 Helmer said he regretted some of his past comments because of the "media storm and the misrepresentation" that made them "an albatross round your neck" during an election campaign.\par \par \uc2 He still has a personal \u8211\'20\'13 though not party \u8211\'20\'13 belief that there was a case for the death penalty. But he said he has updated his views on many issues and now accepts homosexuality.\par \par \uc2 "The world has changed; we're in the 21st century," he said. "Many of us are much more relaxed about things we would have been concerned about years ago. As views change, I guess I catch the zeitgeist. People do.\par \par \uc2 "Put it this way, our lead candidate in Scotland is David Coburn, who is openly gay. I've been up to work with him. I am very confident he will be down in Newark and I will welcome him and be extremely grateful for his assistance."\par \par \uc2 Helmer, who was selected on Tuesday, suggested he was unlikely to move to the constituency from his Leicestershire home in the first year as he probably would not have time to buy a new house but he would have an address and somewhere to stay in the town.\par \par \uc2 However, he would resign as an MEP immediately if he were to be elected to both roles. The politician said opposing wind turbines, fighting for local \uc2 NHS\uc2  services and the national issue of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  would be major topics on which he would base his campaign.\par \par \uc2 "I have simply never seen such a positive reaction on the streets, on the doorstep, in the marketplace. People are fed up with the legacy parties. They really want a change," he said.\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140507ea58000e9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

When I have been asked about my feelings towards those individuals who murdered my son, I feel angry at the fact these young men had taken away my son's life and his future, but I don't feel hate.\par \par \uc2 "As you know, my son Stephen was murdered just over 21 years ago and I have fought all these years to gain justice for his murder.\par \par \uc2 "It wasn't until 2012, after much campaigning and dedication, that we saw partial justice in the conviction of two of his murderers."\par \par \uc2 She told the audience gathered for the National Conference on Hate Crime in Scotland that it is important to work together to pursue the "dignity of difference".\par \par \uc2 "We want a society in which success and choice are not merely limited to a few but available to all," she said.\par \par \uc2 "We want a society in which not just opportunity but also the outcomes of education create success and are fairly balanced across all ethnic groups.\par \par \uc2 "Choice and equality must extend beyond the barriers of class, gender and race.

They say they are against Europeans taking our jobs and then, when they have a chance to offer some British people work delivering their leaflets because they can\u8217\'20\'19t find volunteers to do it, they employ European workers.'\par \par \uc2 The row comes after it\u160\'00\'A0emerged that one of the stars of a Ukip poster campaign, who appeared to be a British builder \u8216\'20\'18hit hard by unlimited cheap labour\u8217\'20\'19, was actually an Irish actor, Dave O\u8217\'20\'19Rourke.\par \par \uc2 Today Ukip launched an investigation into a tweet from a party account boasting about its 'indigenous, white candidate' in the Newark by-election, Roger Helmer, who today gave an interview stressing he was now more relaxed about gay people.\par \par \uc2 Ukip has urged to 18 per cent in the latest Survation poll for the Mirror, with the Tories just one point behind Labour.\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives have been torn between attacking Ukip and trying to woo its supporters.\par \par \uc2 But today in the Commons, Mr Cameron accused Ukip of having a negative outlook about the future.\par \par \uc2 Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, he said: 'Britain has benefited from being an economy that is open to investment and open to people coming who want to contribute and work hard here.\par \par \uc2 'So much of their view seems to be that we don't have a bright future in this country.\par \par \uc2 'I absolutely believe that we do, if we get our deficit down, we get our economy growing, we invest in apprenticeships, we show that we can be one of the success stories of the 21st Century. We're making progress and that is the way to challenge their world view.'\par \par \uc2 Ukip has made gains in the polls after stepping up its attacks on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and the EU.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday the party confirmed its controversial MEP Roger Helmer will fight the upcoming Newark by-election for the party - despite recent controversy over a series of remarks about homosexuality.\par \par \uc2 The party's local \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account - UKIP Newark - tweeted soon after: Newark: Our indiginous white candidate is ready to rock and roll #LetsDoThis.'\par \par \uc2 Party aides inititally suggested the account was not official, but later it posted another message stating: 'Several members have access to this account. Tweet deleted. Investigation begun.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Helmer sparked outrage in 2012 after likening gay marriage to incest.\par \par \uc2 The 70-year-old has also claimed people should be able to prefer being straight to being gay - like some people prefer Earl Grey to ordinary tea.\par \par \uc2 And in 2000 he said being gay is \u8216\'20\'18not worthy of valid equal respect\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 But in an interview with The Times today he said he had relaxed his views, but appeared to suggest gay people are more likely to have threesomes.\par \par \uc2 Mr Helmer said: 'I was raised in a very traditional home and I guess I grew up with those attitudes, but hell, we are now in the 21st century and my position is exactly the same as the party's position: that we are a broadly libertarian party and what two consenting adults, or indeed more than two consenting adults, choose to do together is none of my business, none of the party's business and as far as we're concerned, they're free to get on with it.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Helmer's selection comes after Ukip leader Nigel Farage ducked the chance to fight the Nottinghamshire seat.\par \par \uc2 The byelection was called after the disgraced former Tory MP Patrick Mercer resigned in the wake of a cash-for-questions scandal.\par \par \uc2 Mr Helmer was elected to the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  in 1999 as the Tory MEP for the East Midlands - and re-elected in 2004 and 2009 - before defecting to Ukip in March 2012.\par \par \uc2 His outspoken views have caused controversy throughout his career and last year even Mr Farage said he had gone 'too far' with his attack on gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 In 2012 Mr Helmer said: 'If two men have a right to marry, how can we deny the same right to two siblings? Are we to authorise incest?'\par \par \uc2 His made the bombshell remarks in a pamphlet entitled 'Straight Talking on Europe'.\par \par \uc2 The year before he asked: 'Why is it OK for a surgeon to perform a sex-change operation, but not OK for a psychiatrist to try to "turn" a consenting homosexual?'\par \par \uc2 Mr Helmer has also dismissed homophobia as a 'weasel word'. He said: 'The homosexual lobby is not content with decriminalisation. It wants to be accepted as a "valid alternative lifestyle".\par \par \uc2 'But it is not a valid lifestyle worthy of equal respect.\par \par \uc2 'At the risk of offending the politically correct, I will argue that homosexual behaviour is abnormal and undesirable.'\par \par \uc2 He previously questioned the existence of 'homophobia', saying some people found gay relationships 'distasteful if not viscerally repugnant'.\par \par \uc2 He defended the remarks, saying: 'Different people have different tastes. You may tell me you don't like Earl Grey tea. That may be a minority view but you are entitled not to like it if you don't like it.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip candidate added: 'I simply made the point that people were entitled to their personal preferences.\par \par \uc2 'It is morally acceptable to prefer heterosexuality over homosexuality, or vice versa.

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Ukip in new hypocrisy row after firm handing out fliers warning about impact \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  on British jobs admits to employing Latvians\par \par \uc2 Ukip has been accused of hypocrisy after claims that Eastern Europeans were paid to hand out fliers warning that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from the EU pose a threat to British jobs.\par \par \uc2 Latvians have been hired by a company in Croydon, Essex, which has been handing out fliers for Ukip ahead of the European elections on May 22.\par \par \uc2 It comes after the party used an Irish actor in a poster earlier this year about Britons missing out on jobs.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  yesterday criticised Ukip's negativity and accused Nigel Farage of acting like Britain does not have a "bright future".\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister suggested that Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s policies are only negative and that Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party does not want to talk about the \u8220\'20\'1Csuccess story\u8221\'20\'1D of Britain.\par \par \uc2 In what will be seen as one of Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s most direct attacks on Ukip, he attempted to portray the Eurosceptic party as downbeat and pessimistic.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether Ukip engages in the politics of fear over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , Mr Cameron said: \u8220\'20\'1CBritain has benefited from being an economy that is open to investment and open to people coming who want to contribute and work hard here.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Yesterday it emerged that Ukip fliers were being delivered by Eastern Europeans hired by Fast Leaflet, a company in Croydon.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Spalis, the company's director, told the Huffington Post that many of his employees are from Latvia and 'only yesterday' his company been working for Ukip.\par \par \uc2 He said: "I've got my phone book full of names and telephone numbers of people who want to make lots of money, and I call them when I need people. Sometimes I take English people, but not very often."\par \par \uc2 Gavin Barwell\uc2 , Conservative MP for Croydon central, said: "Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s hypocrisy knows no bounds. They say they are against Europeans taking our jobs and then, when they have a chance to offer some British people work delivering their leaflets because they can\u8217\'20\'19t find volunteers to do it, they employ European workers."\par \par \uc2 Speaking in the Commons yesterday, Mr Cameron said: \u8220\'20\'1CSo much of [Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s] view seems to be that we don\u8217\'20\'19t have a bright future in this country. I absolutely believe that we do.\par \par \uc2 "If we get our deficit down, we get our economy growing, we invest in apprenticeships, we show that we can be one of the success stories of the 21st Century. We\u8217\'20\'19re making progress and that is the way to challenge their world view.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Ukip declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140507ea57005h9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Could a vote for Nigel Farage put Labour into No 10?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Iain Martin   \par \uc2 1,765 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par 18:22\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 One year before the general election, a surge in popularity for Ukip could have the calamitous effect of handing power to Ed Miliband\par \par \uc2 With the Tories uncertain how to handle the Ukip surge, on the campaign trail last week \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  tried a little humour. On Friday he mocked the propensity of Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party to get into scrapes that would doom other parties: \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t need to discredit Ukip. They have done a good enough job of that over the last few weeks.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 If Mr Cameron hoped that his joke would suggest relaxed insouciance and boundless prime ministerial self-confidence, it is Ukip that is laughing all the way to the European elections.\par \par \uc2 Not only do the recent suggestions of racism and financial chicanery seem to have bounced off Ukip, the publicity seems only to have boosted the party\u8217\'20\'19s rebellious reputation. The renegades, riding a wave of popular discontent with the mainstream parties, have even charged into the lead in opinion polls ahead of the Euros later this month.\par \par \uc2 Then, last week, the former Tory MP Patrick Mercer presented Ukip leader Nigel Farage with another golden opportunity. Following a parliamentary inquiry into revelations that he had agreed to take cash for asking questions in the Commons, Mr Mercer announced that he would stand down and trigger an awkward by-election for the Conservatives.\par \par \uc2 In Newark, the Tories are defending a majority of more than 16,000 votes, which theoretically should make the seat safe. However, in the current febrile atmosphere, with voters looking for ways to kick the established parties and with Mr Farage on the rampage, anything is possible.\par \par \uc2 At least the Tories will not have to face Mr Farage himself as a candidate on June 5. Fearing the consequences if he gambled and failed to win Ukip its first Commons seat, he announced that the party would choose a candidate with a local connection instead. That way Mr Farage still gets his fun without risking personal defeat. After the Euros on May 22, he can dedicate himself to campaigning for his party\u8217\'20\'19s Newark candidate and mining the anti-Tory publicity like mad. Mr Farage suspected that if he stood himself and lost, it would be reported as the bursting of the bubble.\par \par \uc2 But once Newark is over, what impact will the Ukip surge have on the general election taking place a year this week?\par \par \uc2 The dawning realisation is that when the European elections and the by-election are out of the way, the Ukip advance threatens a large number of Conservative seats at the general election. Although it remains unlikely that Ukip will win many \u8211\'20\'13 or even any \u8211\'20\'13 Westminster seats next year, it looks set to do tremendous damage to the Tories merely by taking sufficient numbers of votes in individual seats and letting Labour through. This could easily give Ed Miliband a majority, or at least make Labour the largest party in a hung parliament.\par \par \uc2 Tory MPs in marginal seats, with small majorities, are looking with nervousness at the rise of Ukip. It has been received wisdom that Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party will slip back when voters concentrate on the general election and the choice between \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and Ed Miliband. But what if Ukip has reached such a level of support that even if it does subside somewhat, it will settle eventually at a level high enough in 2015 to gift the election to Labour?\par \par \uc2 This way, almost by accident, thanks to Tory electoral failure and the rise of Ukip, Britain could end up getting a very Left-wing government led by the unpopular Mr Miliband.\par \par \uc2 One Tory MP said: \u8220\'20\'1CIronically, just when people are saying that there is no difference between the parties, there is actually quite a big difference this time. Miliband has a pretty extreme agenda.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Miliband is certainly less friendly to business than his predecessors \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  and Tony Blair were when they were fighting for power in the mid-1990s. The Tories point out that Labour under Mr Miliband is already committed to reinstating the 50p tax band and freezing energy prices. The party is also open to the possibility of further wealth taxes. And last week, Mr Miliband unveiled plans aimed at dealing with alleged market failure, pledging to place new restrictions on the private housing market for renting.\par \par \uc2 Despite there being little evidence that rents are soaring, as Labour claims, the party will create limits to prevent what it deems \u8220\'20\'1Cexcessive increases\u8221\'20\'1D and create the right to longer tenancies.\par \par \uc2 The restrictions could persuade some landlords of a smaller number of properties to sell up. Reducing the supply of properties for rent or concentrating control in the hands of fewer landlords will tend to increase prices.\par \par \uc2 Tory headquarters accused Labour of adopting measures like those favoured by the Left-wing Marxist Venezuelan government. Even if that was an extreme characterisation, Mr Miliband seems incapable of seeing an area of private activity without intervening with a fiddly piece of statist micro-management. It was a glimpse of the approach the Tories say Mr Miliband will adopt if he becomes Prime Minister.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf he gets in, you can kiss goodbye to the recovery. People need to understand he\u8217\'20\'19ll tax and regulate it out of existence,\u8221\'20\'1D says a Tory aide.\par \par \uc2 The prospect of defeat and the likely socialist predilections of a Labour government are increasingly preoccupying Tory ministers and MPs. And as is often the case ahead of a close-fought general election, attention centres on the most vulnerable seats as MPs start to ask if they will have a job after the electoral storm.\par \par \uc2 In the top 25 Tory-held seats most at risk, there are plenty in which even a small increase in the Ukip vote could hand Labour victory.\par \par \uc2 Even before Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party began to increase its support, the challenge facing the Tories at the next election is enormous. The unreformed boundaries means Labour starts with an advantage, and considerable numbers of those who voted Liberal Democrat in 2010 have since returned to the Labour fold.\par \par \uc2 Now the Conservatives have to worry about Ukip as well. Bedford, which the Tories narrowly took from Labour in 2010, illustrates the dilemma. Richard Fuller won with a majority of 1,353 and Ukip came fourth with just 1,136 votes (2.5 per cent of the vote). If Labour take votes from the Lib Dems and Ukip merely doubles its 2010 vote, it will be all but impossible for the Tories to hold on.\par \par \uc2 Enfield North in London is another such seat. Nick de Bois has a majority over Labour of 1,692 and Ukip came fifth behind the British National Party last time. Even a relatively small boost for Ukip could help dislodge the Tories and turn the seat Labour again.\par \par \uc2 Nationally, Mr Farage is performing in polls at levels that suggest the party could more than double its share of the vote in target seats. Even in the 2010 election, Ukip managed to get 3.1 per cent of the vote, despite Mr Farage not being leader and the party attracting little attention. It is now consistently polling above 12 per cent in opinion polls.\par \par \uc2 Says a Tory MP: \u8220\'20\'1CUkip is not going to get 3 per cent of the vote next time. In the end it will be more like 7 per cent or 8 per cent. We are stuffed if that happens.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Prof John Curtice, one of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s leading psephologists, called it \u8220\'20\'1Calmost inconceivable\u8221\'20\'1D that Ukip could sink back to 3.1 per cent of the national vote.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CGiven how high Ukip support has been and for how long, it is difficult to see how the genie can go all the way back in the bottle.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Part of the difficulty for the Tories may be that some of the new Ukip voters they need to woo back are not convinced that they or their children are benefiting personally from the economic recovery, he adds.\par \par \uc2 So far, the Tories have struggled in their attempts to convince such voters that Mr Cameron understands their concerns. Mr Farage \u8211\'20\'13 with his populist position on restricting \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 is ideally positioned to win the support of those who feel left behind.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s about personality, too. They don\u8217\'20\'19t see any difference between Cameron and Miliband,\u8221\'20\'1D says a Tory rebel.\par \par \uc2 Another Tory MP was more sanguine. \u8220\'20\'1CThere isn\u8217\'20\'19t much we can do about this Ukip thing for the European elections. It has to blow itself out and then we see where we get to after Newark. After that, it is a choice between us and Ed Miliband.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A veteran Labour MP agreed that Ukip will slide: \u8220\'20\'1CThey\u8217\'20\'19ll easily get over 30 per cent of the vote in the Euro elections and then they\u8217\'20\'19ll be back at 5 per cent this time next year. I think we\u8217\'20\'19re looking at a small outright Tory majority.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Tories must pray he is right. On Friday, the Prime Minister travelled to North Staffordshire ostensibly to launch the Tories\u8217\'20\'19 local election campaign. He highlighted the economic recovery, although the main target of his remarks was Ukip and the voters who are defecting. He repeated his pledge of a renegotiation of the terms of membership of the EU and then an in-out referendum if he wins the general election.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTo those people who say you won\u8217\'20\'19t deliver on that renegotiation or on that referendum, I say: judge me by my record as prime minister. Others talk about acting in the national interest or in standing up to Europe, I do it, time and again. People said I would never veto a European treaty. In 2011, that\u8217\'20\'19s exactly what I did. People said my attempts to cut the European budget would fail. I secured that cut.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI have a track record of delivery. Believe me, whatever it takes, I will deliver this in-out referendum. Labour won\u8217\'20\'19t. Ukip can\u8217\'20\'19t. I will.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Unsurprisingly, Ukip rejects this analysis. The party is being carried along by a populist surge of discontent and its leading figures are enjoying the discomfort of the established parties. They think it can sweep them all the way to a position where the UK gets out of the EU.\par \par \uc2 Unless Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s message cuts through to Ukip supporters, and the Tories can secure their allegiance, electoral victory may well belong to the most Left-wing Labour leader in more than 30\u160\'00\'A0years.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140504ea54000ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Society Pages\par \b \uc2 Society: Second thoughts: Our general election planner aims to help marginalised groups play a full part in 2015, says Su Sayer\b0\par\par\uc2 Su Sayer   \par \uc2 473 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 37\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Exactly one year from today, the country will go to the polls to record its verdict on the coalition's performance and decide on the UK's next government. While this may seem a long way off to most people every single day will be needed by charities, advocacy groups and pro-democratic organisations if they are to reach the more disenfranchised groups, such as disabled people, recent \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  or people with low literacy. At a time when overall turnout is dropping, this work is particularly important.\par \par \uc2 That's why United Response is today launching its new election planner. This is a guide of 10 simple chronological steps designed to help anyone who works to encourage "hard to reach" groups to vote. It is based on our own experience of running voting awareness campaigns, including our successful Every Vote Counts guides. These guides helped double the number of people with learning disabilities voting in the 2010 election - though there is still a long way to go before they vote in equal numbers to non-disabled citizens.\par \par \uc2 The reasons low numbers of people with learning disabilities vote include the mistaken belief that they are not legally entitled to vote, as well as the complexity of the voting system. Voters from different ethnic backgrounds may feel that they are not represented by any of the main political parties. While the election planner was designed with people with learning disabilities in mind, its principles and ideas can be applied to work with other groups. For example, one of the planner's 10 key stages is "do the groundwork", which means ensuring that people are legally entitled to vote and are registered.\par \par \uc2 Another of the 10 key stages is to "engage with the candidates". Parliamentary candidates, particularly those in marginal seats, are often keen to engage with different constituencies. At the last election, some of our local groups organised hustings where candidates addressed voters with learning disabilities directly. These proved very powerful in both engaging with new voters and educating the candidates.\par \par \uc2 Of course, all of these things take time to organise, and many charities and advocacy groups are overstretched. That's why we want to fire the starting pistol today, and begin the race for the next election. Take a look at our planner and sign up to receive updates in the next year. We'll be sharing best practice on behalf of other organisations. Only if the next year is used wisely will marginalised groups get their chance to participate and make the next election the most inclusive one in our history.\par \par \uc2 Su Sayer is chief executive of United Response.

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The home secretary, Theresa May, is to ask the Commons today to back her plan to deprive terror suspects of British citizenship, even if it leaves them stateless.\par \par \uc2 The home secretary will ask MPs to overturn a House of Lords amendment to her \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  bill, which would seriously delay her plans by insisting that a joint committee of peers and MPs scrutinise the proposal before it can become law.\par \par \uc2 May will, however, announce that she is prepared to concede a second Lords defeat on her \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  bill and will put in place plans for specialist independent advocates for trafficked children. It is believed that the legislation for the child guardians will be included in the modern slavery bill instead of the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  bill, which will reach the statute book shortly.\par \par \uc2 The home secretary intends to press ahead with her plan to strip terror suspects of British citizenship, including British fighters returning from Syria who are suspected of having fought alongside jihadists, despite strong criticism.\par \par \uc2 A former director of public prosecutions, a former supreme court judge and 23 Liberal Democrats were among the 242 peers who supported Lord Pannick's successful Lords amendment that would delay its implementation. The move was added to the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  bill in January without any of the pre-legislative scrutiny that the remainder was subject to.\par \par \uc2 At the time of the Lords defeat, Pannick said: "There are regrettably all too many dictators around the world willing to use the creation of statelessness as a weapon. We should do nothing to suggest that it is acceptable."\par \par \uc2 The director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, said: "Removing the right to have rights is a new low. Washing our hands of potential terrorists is dangerously short-sighted and statelessness is a tool of despots not democrats."\par \par \uc2 Her criticism was echoed by the human rights organisation Reprieve, whose legal director, Kat Craig, said the French rightwing Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, was calling on the French government to implement May's plan.\par \par \uc2 Craig said: "When Le Pen and the French far right are the strongest supporters of a policy, alarm bells should be ringing for the government. This shows that not only are Theresa May's plans for the arbitrary exile of Britons dangerously extreme, they are also setting a terrible example around the world."\par \par \uc2 May has argued that the 1961 UN convention on statelessness included the ability to deprive a naturalised person of their citizenship if they conducted themselves "in a manner seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of Her Britannic Majesty".\par \par \uc2 On the issue of guardians for child victims of trafficking, a Home Office spokesman said that trials of specialist child advocates across 23 local authority areas that were announced in January would go ahead this summer.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti said rendering terror suspects stateless was 'a tool of despots not democrats'\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140507ea570002j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Special report: British National party: How Griffin set out a vision of 'final victory over international capitalism and Zionism': 1990s race-hate conviction papers unmask ideology: CPS reveals leader's fear of white race's extinction\b0\par\par\uc2 Ian Cobain   \par \uc2 1,569 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 An insight into the political convictions and electoral strategy of Nick Griffin at the point at which he took control of the British National party (BNP) has been disclosed with the release of a series of documents, including police interviews, concerning his prosecution on race hate charges in the late 1990s.\par \par \uc2 The papers, from the \uc2 Crown Prosecution Service\uc2 , illustrate how Griffin believed the Holocaust did not happen, was convinced that multi-culturalism was the result of a plot by international capitalism and Zionism and held the wish to win political power so as to "peacefully and humanely as possible" recreate Britain as an overwhelmingly white nation.\par \par \uc2 Griffin, who in this month's elections is fighting to retain the European parliament seat he won in 2009, also talks about how the British mass media was "greatly controlled" by what he calls "organised Jewry" and how many of the films made in Hollywood, including Steven Spielberg's, are "anti-white" propaganda.\par \par \uc2 The documents, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, also show that Griffin believed it was possible for him and like-minded individuals to take power in Britain by developing a political party with broad appeal and the capacity to mount well run election campaigns.\par \par \uc2 The papers include transcripts of police interviews with Griffin before he was charged under the Public Order Act with publishing a magazine likely to stir up racial hatred. In 1998 he was tried and convicted and received a nine-month suspended prison sentence. The following year he came to the public's attention for the first time when he was elected leader of the BNP.\par \par \uc2 He immediately began to attempt to transform the BNP's image from that of a thuggish neo-Nazi movement to a party that embraced populist rightwing policies, such as withdrawal from the EU and restrictions on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . The party's latest campaign highlights the danger it claims Britain's seal population faces because of Brussels' fisheries policy.\par \par \uc2 Griffin was elected in 2009 as a member of the European parliament for north-west England after the BNP polled 132,000 votes, 8% of the total, on a turnout of 32%. At the next election he is expected to face greater pressure from the UK Independence party (Ukip), and some observers are predicting a slump in the BNP's vote.\par \par \uc2 The question of whether Griffin ever genuinely shed his antisemitic views is difficult to answer. Shortly before he became the BNP's leader he said he hoped to learn from past mistakes such as letting his "youthful enthusiasm for perfect ideas to run far beyond what's politically possible". In 2009, during an appearance on the BBC's Question Time, he struggled to explain his views on the Holocaust. David Dimbleby asked whether he had denied it, to which he replied: "I do not have a conviction for Holocaust denial."\par \par \uc2 Asked last month if he still believed the Holocaust did not happen, his press officer, Simon Darby, said: "It's old hat, he won't talk about that. It's irrelevant. Are you Jewish yourself? It's a non-story."\par \par \uc2 Darby said Griffin would not answer questions on his beliefs because "you have never given him a fair crack of the whip - you will only distort what he said". Griffin did not respond to emailed questions.\par \par \uc2 The papers were obtained under FoI from the CPS. The CPS spent more than two years trying to prevent their release, arguing at one point that the information was Griffin's sensitive personal data. The documents were released after the Information Tribunal ruled that disclosure was in the "substantial public interest".\par \par \uc2 The papers include a statement from a police officer who overheard Griffin take a phone call while police searched his home near Welshpool. The officer said: "I . . . heard him say to this unknown caller 'they're very civilised, more civilised than the Met, no Jews or Pakis.'"\par \par \uc2 While being interviewed by two detectives at Welshpool police station later that day, Griffin said the purpose of everything he did could be summed up in one sentence: "We must secure the existence of our race and a future for white children." This is a slogan known as the Fourteen Words, which is popular with white supremacist groups in the US.\par \par \uc2 He added: "Everything I do is related to building a nationalist movement through which peaceful persuasion and through the ballot box can place us in a position whereby those 14 words can be carried out."\par \par \uc2 Griffin said there were some British nationalists who believed they should resort to violence. "There are some people who are saying, 'the IRA has got a long way in Ulster . . . by killing people, so that is what we should do.'" He believed, however, that the British far-right should study the example set by the Front National in France, which was beginning to make significant electoral inroads. "They're coming towards political power through the ballot box. So I'm saying it is possible."\par \par \uc2 Griffin also told the police that he believed that "by the end of the next century the white race will be headed inevitably for extinction"; that he did not wish to see large numbers of people "from any ethnic group other than British and European stock" residing in the UK; and that while he had "no antipathy to Jews, as Jews", he believed they had too much control of the British media.\par \par \uc2 "It's not a belief . . . that organised Jewry has a massively disproportionate hold on the mass media; it's a fact," he said. "It is my belief that what the mass media is doing in terms of propaganda in this country is overwhelmingly harmful."\par \par \uc2 He also had a problem with Hollywood, which he said had produced "about 550 grotesquely anti-white films" over the previous 30 or 40 years. He was particularly upset by the director Steven Spielberg, whom he accused of making films that were "fundamentally anti-white propaganda and lying propaganda at that".\par \par \uc2 The detectives questioned Griffin about a passage he had written in a BNP magazine called Rune which referred to a "final victory over those who seek to destroy us so that they can rule unchallenged forever over a mass of mongrel slaves". Asked to whom he was referring, Griffin replied: "International capitalism and international Zionism."\par \par \uc2 He added: "If a movement dedicated to preserving the white peoples of the west in their own countries does not come to power then within a very short space of time historically, the white race will cease to exist."\par \par \uc2 A detective constable noted that Griffin had written about "winning", and asked: "What would winning mean to you?" Griffin replied: "Taking political power so as to be able to institute changes, to undo the population shift which has taken place since 1948 with the first \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Act, to peacefully and as humanely as possible reverse that and to return Britain to being a homogeneous white nation."\par \par \uc2 The officers then moved on to the Holocaust. Griffin told them: "If you end up with a full-scale war then huge numbers of innocent people are killed. But the allegation that there was a systematic and deliberate policy whereby six million Jews were gassed to death is for a variety of forensic and common sense reasons, utter nonsense."\par \par \uc2 Asked towards the end of the interview to reiterate his political motives, he replied: "Fourteen words."\par \par \uc2 No press or independent observers were present when Griffin appeared at Harrow crown court. One prosecution lawyer recalls that Griffin sacked his defence team, then defended himself on the basis that the contents of Rune were justified. The jury found him guilty.\par \par \uc2 On becoming leader of the BNP Griffin gave a speech in the US to American and European far-right activists warning them against going too far with their "revisionist" claims about the Holocaust.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, BNP activists were warned against displays of the "three Hs" - hobbyism, hard talk and Hitler - and were urged to characterise themselves as defenders of free speech against a politically correct liberal establishment.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, however, Griffin appears to have returned to the theme that emerged during his police interviews. In a speech at the European parliament in March, he said he believed "an unholy alliance of leftists, capitalists and Zionist supremacists have schemed to promote \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and miscegenation".\par \par \uc2 Their purpose, he added - in a speech that could be one of his last to the parliament - was to "breed us out of existence".\par \par \uc2 Political life:\par \par \uc2 1972 Joins National Front at the age of 14 and remains a member until 1989.\par \par \uc2 1995 Joins the British National party.\par \par \uc2 1998 Receives nine-month suspended sentence under Public Order Act for publishing magazine likely to stir up racial hatred.\par \par \uc2 1999 Replaces John Tyndall as leader of the BNP.\par \par \uc2 2005 BNP contests 119 seats at general election but wins none. Increases votes from 47,219 in 2001 to 192,850.\par \par \uc2 2006 Griffin and Mark Collett cleared of inciting racial hatred in speeches.\par \par \uc2 2009 Griffin and Andrew Brons elected to European parliament for BNP.\par \par \uc2 Luc Torres\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Nick Griffin campaigning in Dagenham, east London, during the general election in 2010 Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140507ea570002c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Leader Pages\par \b \uc2 Leading Article: Ethnic minority voters: Identity politics\b0\par\par\uc2 Editorial   \par \uc2 724 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 32\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 As usual, some of the figures are open to debate. The implications for the political parties are not. The centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange grabbed headlines this week by saying, in a new report, that ethnic minorities will make up a third of Britain by 2050. In fact, this was how some newspapers chose to headline the story. The report itself, A Portrait of Modern Britain, was more cautious. It rehearses differing estimates that black and minority ethnic communities will represent "between 20-30% of the UK's population" by 2051. This is rather different. There is a big gap between 20% and 30% - and 30% is both a maximum estimate and not the same thing as a third. Since the current figure for BME communities is already 14%, the increase over the next 35 years could actually be relatively modest if the figure turns out to be closer to the 20% that one expert cited in the report has estimated.\par \par \uc2 But the political implications of Britain's changing demography remain challenging, irrespective of the precise nature of the figures that give rise to them. In Britain, as in most other developed economies in the western world, changing demographics are already a reality. They are also already shaping the agendas, assumptions and methods of the old politics. That change will intensify, as the second and third generations of migrants reach voting age and as differential birthrates recast the ethnic map. Crucially, as the report stresses, Britain's political parties are unprepared for the lasting importance of such changes.\par \par \uc2 Ethnic minorities in Britain share roughly similar levels of partisanship - identification with a political party - to the white population. In many other respects, however, the political and electoral profile of BME voters is very different from that of whites. BME citizens are less often registered to vote than whites, a divergence that may increase when individual voter registration is introduced. But the biggest difference is in the degree to which all BME groups identify with and overwhelmingly vote for Labour. In the 2010 election, in which Labour lost and did badly, 68% of all BME voters nevertheless voted Labour, compared with 31% of white voters. On the other hand, only 16% of BME voters voted Conservative, compared with 37% of whites.\par \par \uc2 Combine the increasing size and proportion of the BME electorate with that striking difference in political identification, and it soon becomes clear that these figures pose a historic challenge for both Labour and the Tories - as well as for other political parties. The challenge is, of course, the reverse one for the two main parties. For Labour the challenge is to retain its grip on BME voters. For the Conservatives it is to increase its appeal. But since only around two-thirds of the electorate now identify with either of the two main parties, the possibility of a majority government of either stripe may hang on the outcome.\par \par \uc2 For Labour the problem is complacency. But the challenge facing the Tories is much more acute. Any strategist who looks at the figures - as Lord Ashcroft has also done - will see that the Tories need to appeal more consistently to BME voters in order to win enough seats to form a government. So the first thing any strategist's memo to \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  would say in the light of the Policy Exchange report is to beware the impact on these vital BME voters of any sudden lurch towards Ukip and its predominantly white electorate in the aftermath of the European elections later this month.\par \par \uc2 That is not the same as saying, for example, that the Tories should do a U-turn on an issue such as \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . That is unlikely to be what BME voters want anyway. But it does mean that the Tory party needs to avoid lazy stereotypes and to reach out to the different ethnic groups on the issues that concern them. The party also needs to be much more self-critical and humble than parts of it are often tempted to be about a range of the party's stances on issues from education to policing. A party of white people speaking only to white people is no longer an option for any party that seeks to speak for the new Britain.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140507ea570001c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Matthew d'Ancona: On \uc2 immigration\uc2 , Ukip is out of step in modern Britain\b0\par\par\uc2 1,033 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par 15:53\par \uc2 London Evening Standard Online\par \uc2 NSONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited.   \par \par \uc2 A new study reveals that attitudes to, and among, ethnic minorities in the UK are changing for the better\par \par \uc2 With each passing day, the rise of Ukip reminds me ever more of the funniest book in the English language, Wodehouse\u8217\'20\'19s The Code of the Woosters. You may recall that the villain of this Jeeves and Wooster masterpiece is Roderick Spode, who leads a fictional fascist group called the \u8220\'20\'1CBlack Shorts\u8221\'20\'1D: a figure both sinister and absurd.\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party is not, of course, fascist, and Farage himself is no \u8220\'20\'1Camateur dictator\u8221\'20\'1D. But he and his colleagues, with their dismal rhetoric and thundering warnings that parts of Britain are becoming \u8220\'20\'1Cunrecognisable\u8221\'20\'1D, are showing, shall we say, distinctly Spodean tendencies.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday Roger Helmer, who considers homosexual behaviour \u8220\'20\'1Cabnormal and undesirable\u8221\'20\'1D, was selected as Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s contender for the Newark by-election. Let us add his nasty beliefs to the pile: Ukip candidates for office have already declared that \u8220\'20\'1CIslam is evil\u8221\'20\'1D, that Lenny Henry should \u8220\'20\'1Cgo and live in a black country\u8221\'20\'1D and that Ed Miliband was \u8220\'20\'1Cnot British\u8221\'20\'1D. In all this, Farage postures as New Spode, Spode-Lite, the sensible reactionary who disowns all such extremity. But he is the prime offender in the sense that he encourages, stokes and depends upon public anxiety about \u8220\'20\'1Cmass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 How refreshing, then, to read A Portrait of Modern Britain, a well-timed report by the think-tank Policy Exchange. The research, by Rishi Sunak and Saratha Rajeswaran, is both hearteningly upbeat and impeccably nuanced. Quarrying data from the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2 , the \uc2 Understanding Society\uc2  study and other academic sources, Policy Exchange has delivered an empirical study of contemporary Britain that is quite at odds with the phobic rantings of Ukip.\par \par \uc2 What do Farage and co make, for instance, of the fact that 90 per cent of white and minority residents \u8220\'20\'1Cfeel that their local area is a place where people from different backgrounds get on well together\u8221\'20\'1D? Or the powerful sense of loyalty to Britain felt by the overwhelming majority of citizens from ethnic minorities? To take one example: 71 per cent of Bangladeshi Britons identify themselves as solely British.\par \par \uc2 The report\u8217\'20\'19s most illuminating premise is that black and ethnic minority (BME) citizens should not be regarded as a single entity but as a series of distinct groups: Indian, Pakistani, Black African, Black Caribbean, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Sikh, and others. This approach means that the portrait is more vividly pixellated: 24 per cent of Pakistani men are taxi drivers; 75 per cent of Indian pupils achieve five A*-C grades (including English and Maths); south Asians are six times more likely to have diabetes than the general population, and so on.\par \par \uc2 Related stories\par \par \uc2 What does unite BME citizens is that, for the most part, they do not trust the Tories. Only 16 per cent of minority voters backed the Conservative Party in 2010, while 68 per cent supported Labour. All that can be said in defence of this lamentable performance is that it was better than the 11 per cent scored by Michael Howard in 2005.\par \par \uc2 In the early years of his leadership, David Cameron made much of this deficit and the need to craft a form of Toryism that was welcoming to BME voters. But the Crash distracted him and Ukip spooked him: in office he has devoted more time to talking tough on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  than to stretching a hand out to minority communities. As I have written before, there is absolutely no point in the Prime Minister chasing Ukip rightwards. Better to speak from the heart and denounce the party for what it is.\par \par \uc2 It is no exaggeration to say that the future of the Conservative Party depends upon this moment of confrontation \u8212\'20\'14 for demographic as well as moral reasons. The Policy Exchange study recruits Professor Philip Rees from the \uc2 University of Leeds\uc2  to model population growth on the basis of a complex database\u160\'00\'A0 and concludes that by 2051 up to 30 per cent of the UK population will come from an ethnic minority.\par \par \uc2 This is a striking prediction. Even more striking, however, has been the relaxed response. Yesterday\u8217\'20\'19s Sun, for instance, hailed \u8220\'20\'1CMELTING POT UK\u8221\'20\'1D, with the subheading \u8220\'20\'1CMPs warned not to ignore minority vote\u8221\'20\'1D. In its editorial, the Daily Telegraph declared the report \u8220\'20\'1Ca reminder of what a unifying concept Britain is\u8221\'20\'1D. Already, according to Policy Exchange, one in eight multi-person households includes people from more than one ethnic group. Almost half a century after Enoch Powell foresaw \u8220\'20\'1Cthe River Tiber foaming with much blood\u8221\'20\'1D, it is flowing peacefully.\par \par \uc2 All the polls suggest that Ukip will do very well in the European elections a fortnight tomorrow. Farage has momentum, the aura of novelty (remember Cleggmania?) and the mask of the Purple Pimpernel who has got under the skin of the \u8220\'20\'1CEstablishment\u8221\'20\'1D. But when he claims, as he did in his spring conference speech, that \u8220\'20\'1Cthis is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren\u8221\'20\'1D, he does not speak for the nation.\par \par \uc2 The complexities of a multi-ethnic society are considerable. But that is just another way of saying that globalisation, digital technology, population mobility and cross-border perils such as fundamentalist terrorism and climate change are redrawing the political and social landscape at unprecedented speed. The good news is that, for all the difficulties implicit in this upheaval, Britain is for the most part handling change with dignity and compassion.\par \par \uc2 As for Ukip, I refer you to Bertie Wooster\u8217\'20\'19s definitive denunciation: \u8220\'20\'1CThe trouble with you, Spode, is that just because you have succeeded in inducing a handful of half-wits to disfigure the London scene by going about in black shorts, you think you\u8217\'20\'19re someone. You hear them shouting \u8216\'20\'18Heil, Spode!\u8217\'20\'19 and you imagine it is the Voice of the People. That is where you make your bloomer. What the Voice of the People is saying is: \u8216\'20\'18Look at that frightful ass Spode swanking about in footer bags! Did you ever in your puff see such a perfect perisher?\u8217\'20\'19\u8221\'20\'1D Timeless and unimprovable.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  @MatthewdAncona\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140507ea57000hz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The left needs a progressive Euroscepticism to counter the EU's ills\b0\par\par\uc2 Costas Lapavitsas   \par \uc2 theguardian.com\par \uc2 840 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par \uc2 Guardian.co.uk\par \uc2 GRULTD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Guardian News & Media Limited. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Costas Lapavitsas: A single European state is neither feasible nor desirable. The left should stress a future of cooperation and equality among its peoples\par \par \uc2 Frustration is currently sweeping Europe and for good reason: persistent unemployment, inequality, weak growth and a pervasive sense of powerlessness, to name a few. Unfortunately, the main political beneficiary is likely to be the Eurosceptic right, and even the extreme right. The left is failing to capitalise on the wave of popular frustration, mostly because it has no progressive Eurosceptic agenda to offer.\par \par \uc2 That is not to say that the left has no radical solutions for the ills afflicting Europe. It rejects the fiscal austerity that is devastating both economic activity and the welfare state; it advocates policies to reduce unemployment, particularly among the young; it favours redistributing income and wealth to confront inequality; it proposes controls over the financial system, one of the main culprits of the current malaise; it backs an investment drive to boost productive capacity and to rebalance the European economy.\par \par \uc2 The trouble is that the left refuses to acknowledge what is increasingly obvious to working people across Europe: these radical policies are impossible within the institutions of the EU. The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 ensured that the EU is run by privileged bureaucrats setting policy in the interests of big business, including deregulating markets and protecting finance. The European Monetary Union and the common currency launched in 1999 have created a rigid framework of permanent austerity, as well as Brussels- and Frankfurt-based controls over national economic policy. The eurozone crisis, far from changing things for the better, has actually hardened the conservative mechanisms at the heart of the EU.\par \par \uc2 The common currency has also made the EU more hierarchical, with a small core and several peripheries. At the top of the hierarchy sits Germany, currently enjoying unprecedented power across the continent, both within and without the eurozone. Strikingly, German workers have not benefited from this extraordinary development, since their own incomes have remained frozen, or risen very slowly, thus allowing German big business to dominate markets. The greatest loser is France, outcompeted by Germany within the eurozone, with poor growth prospects, large deficits, and its welfare system under strain. The future position of Britain in the new alignment of economic and political power in Europe is far from clear.\par \par \uc2 As the EU has hardened, its decision-making has become more undemocratic and even anti-democratic. In dealing with the eurozone crisis, for instance, the EU imposed unelected governments in both Italy and Greece, while forcibly denying the Greek people the right to hold a referendum on whether to accept their "rescue". The sense of powerlessness and loss of democratic rights among voters is well-justified.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy has been a shambles. On the one hand, the free movement of labour within the EU, without basic institutions to support workers in receiving countries, was never going to be a smooth affair in a continent comprising so many different languages and cultures. On the other, the "fortress Europe" policy of keeping out the unwanted masses of Africa and Asia has turned southern countries into a regular battleground, with \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  held in camps in desperate conditions.\par \par \uc2 This potent mix of economic failure and big business favouritism now threatens to boost the extreme right as nationalist and racist ghosts have reappeared in Europe. The left should seek to counter this prospect, but not by calling for strengthened European integration in the hope of creating a "better" EU. The institutional mechanisms of the EU are too far gone to be reformed. They have to be dismantled and replaced. The left should, rather, voice the frustration of working people by sending a clear anti-capitalist message that combines radical policies with progressive Euroscepticism. Two steps are vital in this regard.\par \par \uc2 The first is to accept that the eurozone has failed irretrievably. Maintaining the common currency through political force and against all sense is actually throttling the economic life of Europe. Individual countries ought to be offered a cooperative exit option. The eurozone as a whole ought to be replaced by a system of managed exchange rates and controlled capital flows, thus avoiding a return to damaging competitive devaluations among nations.\par \par \uc2 The second is to realise that a single European state, whether federal or unitary, is neither feasible nor desirable. The fundamental reason is that there is no single European "demos". Indeed, the eurozone crisis has shown that the mechanisms of the nation state can offer some protection against heavy encroachment by big business using EU mechanisms. The left ought to stress that the future of Europe is one of democratic cooperation among its peoples on the basis of equality.\par \par \uc2 The coming Euro elections are likely to deliver a hefty jolt to European politics. If the left heeds the message and develops a progressive Euroscepticism, things might begin to improve in Europe.\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140507ea57000b6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

I absolutely believe that we do.\par \par \uc2 "If we get our deficit down, we get our economy growing, we invest in apprenticeships, we show that we can be one of the success stories of the 21st Century. We\u8217\'20\'19re making progress and that is the way to challenge their world view.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Downing Street aides said that Ukip has an \u8220\'20\'1Capproach\u8221\'20\'1D that \u8220\'20\'1Ceverything is going very badly wrong\u8221\'20\'1D, particularly when it comes to the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Prime Minister's view is we can be very confident about Britain's future in the world and how the economy is improving,\u8221\'20\'1D an aide said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn terms of the response on Ukip, it's a reflection of sometimes their approach would be everything is going very badly wrong, remaining in the EU is going to be a disaster for Britain, we can't prosper or benefit.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Prime Minister's view very strongly is if you get the right reforms Britain can go on and build on the recovery we have seen already. The PM is very confident about Britain's future.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron has stepped up his attacks on Ukip in recent weeks. He has repeatedly said that a vote for Ukip in next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election could let Labour into power.\par \par \uc2 It comes after an analysis by YouGov showed that 42 per cent of those who voted Conservative in 2010 plan to back Ukip in the European elections this month.\par \par \uc2 Of 9,000 people questioned by the polling group, almost 2,000 said they would vote for the anti-European party if a general election were held now.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140507ea57003uy\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Regulars\par \b \uc2 Tweets of the Day\b0\par\par\uc2 By STAFF REPORTER   \par \uc2 176 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par 13:45\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd.

Seriously, I can't praise him highly enough."\par \par \uc2 Mr Crosby is known as a master of "dog-whistle politics", defined as the ability "to make potential supporters sit up and take notice while avoiding offending those to whom the message would not appeal".\par \par \uc2 In 2012, he was appointed by the Conservatives to lead the general election campaign on a \u163\'00\'A3200,000 salary.\par \par \uc2 He has brought much-needed discipline to the Conservative HQ and inspires fierce loyalty from his staff.\par \par \uc2 The Labour Party has attempted to attack him over his lobbying links but has so far failed to score any major victories.\par \par \uc2 His appointment has created a growing sense of optimism in the Tory Party. Mr Crosby\u8217\'20\'19s appointment currently looks to be one of \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s most shrewd decisions in recent years.\par \par \uc2 ________________\par \par \uc2 CV\par \par \uc2 Born: 1956, Kadina, Yorke peninsula, South Australia\par \par \uc2 Family: Crosby was the youngest of three children born to a cereal farmer.

He masterminded the four national election victories of John Howard, the former Australian Prime Minister. In 2002, he set up a consulting firm with Mark Textor, an Australian pollster. The company has since overseen hundreds of campaigns all over the world. In 2005, Crosby managed former Conservative leader \uc2 Michael Howard\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s unsuccessful general election campaign. He then oversaw Boris Johnson\u8217\'20\'19s two mayoral victories over Ken Livingston in 2008 and 2012.

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Afghan \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  rescued while trying to cross the Channel on a makeshift raft\par \par \uc2 A young Afghan man has been rescued by French coastguards after risking his life trying to reach Britain on a makeshift raft fashioned from six planks and a bedsheet sail.\par \par \uc2 Asif Hussainkhil, 33, was picked up two miles off Sangatte near Calais, after he was spotted from a ferry as he tried to make the 21-mile Channel crossing.\par \par \uc2 Rescuers said he was lucky not to have capsized and been killed, and had \u8220\'20\'1Czero per cent chance of making it to Britain\u8221\'20\'1D on the flimsy craft.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hussainkhil, from Kabul, had spent three weeks building the vessel behind sand dunes, constructing a mast from two crutches spliced together. He had not included a rudder on the raft.\par \par \uc2 He had no compass or food when he was saved and was dressed in a thin windcheater and rainproof trousers.\par \par \uc2 The perilous crossing attempt was made amid reports of increasing desperation among migrants trying to get illegally from France to Britain.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hussainkhil said he had been in Calais for a month and a half, but left Afghanistan in 2000 when the Taliban were in power and he feared for his life. To reach Calais, he went through Iran, Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Italy, and Switzerland. \u8220\'20\'1CEngland is my last stop,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CI was sitting in the tent, thinking how can I get to England. Ever since I was a child, I have liked England. It\u8217\'20\'19s a strong, powerful country. I want to join my uncle and cousins there. It was so hard here, so I thought I\u8217\'20\'19ll make a boat and try and get there myself. I have no money, so I just used stuff around me at the camp.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The boat was made of six pieces of wood, with three buoys underneath and blue life jacket material to sit on.\par \par \uc2 He added: \u8220\'20\'1CThe plan was to get over the Britain, but the wind wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t let me. I was never scared of drowning. I can swim. The boat was made of stuff that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t sink.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This was his third attempt at crossing the Channel, he said. The first two times he swam wearing makeshift flippers built out of wood.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI swam for about three hours but got caught. The second time, I only swam for an hour and they caught me,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par \uc2 Christian Salom\u233\'00\'E9, who runs the Auberge des Migrants association, which offers food and assistance to migrants, said Mr Hussainkhil had built the boat \u8220\'20\'1Cbefore everyone\u8217\'20\'19s eyes\u8221\'20\'1D in a makeshift camp in front of the port.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHe was really desperate to get to Britain after having failed to get across hidden in lorries and being picked up by the police so many times,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople told him not to try, that it was impossible, but he reacted like a child who wanted to absolutely have a go. His mind was made up. It was almost as if it were a game. He is very young and childish.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Bernard Barron, the head of the coast rescue service in Calais, said the would-be sailor had been \u8220\'20\'1Cpretty disappointed at being rescued until we explained to him the perils awaiting him\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The raft was quickly swept into a ferry lane after he set off from Bleriot beach and he had only been on the water 30 minutes when he was spotted from the P&O ferry Spirit of Britain, which radioed coastguards to pick him up.\par \par \uc2 Mr Barron said if Mr Hussainkhil had not been rescued, the raft would have drifted into rougher seas. He said: \u8220\'20\'1CHe was no sailor. He had no rudder, no compass, nothing at all. The greatest danger for him was to capsize, in which case his raft would have disintegrated.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe chances of reaching the British coast were zero.\u8221\'20\'1D Water temperatures of around 63F (17C) meant he would have lasted a maximum of 45 minutes if he had fallen in, it was estimated. \u8220\'20\'1CAfter that, he would have drowned. The water is so cold at the moment that he wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t have lasted long,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr Barron.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hussainkhil was undaunted by his failed attempt, however. \u8220\'20\'1CThe boat will get better and better each time and God willing I will make it across,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140506ea56003jw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw138\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2070\pichgoal600

Romanians in the Home Counties, Polish and Latvians in Lincolnshire, Polish communities in Cumbria and Italians in Surrey were identified as creating very localised problems by researchers from \uc2 Northumbria University\uc2 . However, in terms of total crime in those areas, the impact of migrants is minimal and does not warrant scaremongering headlines, the researchers believe. 'The findings suggest that there is no national issue,' said \uc2 Derek Johnson\uc2 , senior lecturer in geography and crime science.\par \par \uc2 Document METRO00020140507ea570001n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw138\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2070\pichgoal600

The think-tank called on \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and Nick Clegg to publish a set of 'rules of the game' for the last year of the coalition government.\par \par \uc2 It warned there was a risk of 'unfairness' to the Lib Dems in drawing up policies with the aid of civil servants, because the Tories run more ministries.\par \par \uc2 Document METRO00020140507ea5700007\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

It is outrageous that we come so far behind when measuring the prospects of our women and children. Angry commenters online like to blame this on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . But our problems are universal; it's not a case of one community or another bringing overall rates down.\par \par \uc2 As a mother-of-two here are the four things I believe have to happen to make Britain a better place to be a mother:\par \par \uc2 </br>The UK simply does not have this. Countries awarded top rankings in the World Mothers Index \u8211\'20\'13 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany \u8211\'20\'13 all offer high-quality childcare to all families. And the offer is taken up.\par \par \uc2 In Britain, nursery provision starts at age three, when children are offered 15 hours a week at an incredible range of (sometimes incredibly bad) facilities. Standards in early years development must improve, and the way to do that is through well-thought-out programmes emphasising exploration and learning through play, not ridiculous pre-school programmes aimed at stuffing young minds into structured learning before they are ready.\par \par \uc2 The first five years of life, and especially the first two, are crucial in brain development. We are missing a major trick in Britain. In Finland, which ranked first in the World Mothers Index, families have access to free universal daycare for children aged eight months to five years. This has been in place since 1990. Early childhood education is not mandatory in Finland, but it is taken up by almost everyone.\par \par \uc2 </br>I thoroughly enjoyed {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9197481/the-descent-of-man/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Isabel Hardman’s piece}}}\uc2  in this week\u8217\'20\'19s Spectator. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10723770/Gwyneth-Paltrow-and-Chris-Martin-split-The-pitfalls-of-marrying-a-British-man.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 British men}}}\uc2  are falling behind, and it\u8217\'20\'19s interesting to note how. Read it, if you haven\u8217\'20\'19t. But even if male cleaners in Swansea were unfairly paid less than their female counterparts, as Hardman points out: \u8220\'20\'1CIn modern Britain, girls are beating the boys at every stage of life \u8211\'20\'13 right up until they leave the workplace to have children.\u8221\'20\'1D And then women fall far, and irreversibly, behind. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10812102/We-have-undersold-our-policies-on-women-David-Cameron-says.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 David Cameron may be proud}}}\uc2  of new figures suggesting that the gender pay gap has fallen since 2010. But in terms of pay and status at work, Britain has lingered for far too long in the 1950s. The gender pay gap stands at 15 per cent, with the disparity even wider in part-time jobs \u8211\'20\'13 and, of course, many mothers work part-time.\par \par \uc2 </br>We\u8217\'20\'19re just average in Britain when it comes to female participation in government. In 2010, 143 women were elected as MPs, making up 22 per cent of the 650 total. Globally, women account for about 20 per cent of parliamentary seats, up from 15 per cent about a decade ago. Nearly a quarter of a century after the exit of Margaret Thatcher, who many see as one of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s greatest modern leaders, why is that still the case?\par \par \uc2 </br>As many women die in childbirth in Britain today as did 20 years ago \u8211\'20\'13 and we\u8217\'20\'19re 23rd on the global league table, according to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2810%2960518-1/fulltext"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 a 2010 study in the medical journal Lancet}}}\uc2  . This means that rates of maternal mortality in the UK trail behind countries including Albania, Poland and Slovakia, as well as wealthier European countries. Encouragingly, a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2010.02847.x/pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 more recent study}}}\uc2 found that overall rates of mortality have decreased in Britain, and that for the first time there has been a reduction in the inequalities gap, with a significant reduction in mortality rates among those living in the poorest areas of the nation.\par \par \uc2 But still, there is more to do.\par \par \uc2 </br>If we don't change the prospects of women in the country, we will continue to lag far behind our northern European neighbours in terms of the prospects for women.\par \par \uc2 My daughter is two. In 20 years, I hope that she lives in a country that offers her as many choices as it offers its men.\par \par \uc2 I would like her to grow up in a country that is dedicated to having more women in government. Do we need quotas? No. But we need more than 20 per cent of our parliamentarians to be women.\par \par \uc2 Must all children go to a state-run nursery? No. But every study I have seen shows that high-quality early years support for families helps all children.\par \par \uc2 If we don't prioritise women's lives in Britain, we will continue to slip further and further down the global league tables.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140507ea570013f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw59\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal885\pichgoal600

The 54-year-old Domestic Goddess looked happy and relaxed as she arrived in New Zealand to promote chocolates.\par \par \uc2 Last month she was allegedly prevented from flying from London to Los Angeles where she has previously filmed cooking talent show The Taste.\par \par \uc2 She was initially granted a "special direction" visa to work in New Zealand but days later officials there admitted it was not needed.\par \par \uc2 It would now appear there are no problems if she wishes to travel to the US in the coming months.\par \par \uc2 The food journalist arrived at Auckland airport on Saturday before heading to Wellington train station yesterday to start filming a TV advert for Whittaker's chocolate.\par \par \uc2 She joked to fellow passengers: "So this is about as far away from England as you can get, isn't it?" A fellow traveller said: "She looked great, especially after such a long flight, and was pretty chatty and upbeat.\par \par \uc2 "She was really unassuming and went through the airport like any other passenger."\par \par \uc2 Nigella has been the face of the chocolate company since 2012.\par \par \uc2 The brand's spokesman said of her visit: "We hope people will respect the fact that we didn't abandon our relationship with her just because of something she did in her past, especially given the tough time she has had recently."\par \par \uc2 Last month, it was alleged that she was prevented from flying from London to Los Angeles where she had filmed The Taste.\par \par \uc2 US authorities refused to discuss the reasons for her not boarding the plane.\par \par \uc2 But it was speculated that the ban was due to her admission in court last year, during the trial of two assistants, that she had used cocaine and cannabis on occasions but was not a habitual user. Initially, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  authorities in New Zealand said that, as she was not allowed to enter the US, she would require special permission to work in New Zealand. But this was overturned because it was not "100 per cent" confirmed that Nigella was excluded from travelling to the US.\par \par \uc2 However, her future at The Taste is uncertain. American TV network ABC is still undecided on whether it will commission a third season.\par \par \uc2 The second season came to an end in February with 3.2 million viewers. Nigella's marriage breakdown and subsequent divorce from art gallery owner Charles Saatchi made headline news last year.\par \par \uc2 She later described the break-up as like having "a layer of skin removed".\par \par \uc2 Multi-millionaire Saatchi, 70, made a series of declarations about their 10-year marriage including the allegation - denied by Nigella - that she was "off her head" on drugs during their time together.\par \par \uc2 In an increasingly vicious court case, where they both gave evidence, Nigella accused him of "intimate terrorism" behind the closed doors of the home they shared in west London.\par \par \uc2 She has since hinted she has stories to tell about Saatchi who was pictured clutching her by the throat outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair last year.In December, she told the trial of her former personal assistants Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo that she had used cocaine seven times and had smoked cannabis.\par \par \uc2 The sisters were acquitted of fraudulent spending on credit cards given to them by the chef and her ex-husband.\par \par \uc2 'She looked great after the long flight and was chatty and upbeat'\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140507ea5700042\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 General election 2015: Look who's not voting Tory\b0\par\par\uc2 By Daniel Hannan   \par \uc2 1,314 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par 09:53\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Ethnic minorities are backing Labour in droves. But one country has bucked the Western trend for \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to support Centre-Left parties\par \par \uc2 The gravest long-term threat to the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Conservative Party}}}\uc2  is not the uneven constituency sizes, nor the split on the Centre-Right, nor yet the party\u8217\'20\'19s weakness in Scotland and parts of northern England. Dwarfing these challenges is the Tories\u8217\'20\'19 failure to win any meaningful measure of support from the fastest-growing section of the population, namely people from ethnic minorities.\par \par \uc2 Britain is undergoing unprecedented demographic change. In 1950, white people were close to 100 per cent of the population; in 2050, they will be 65 per cent. And not being white is the single greatest predictor of not voting Conservative.\par \par \uc2 Look at how people from different backgrounds voted at the last {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 election}}}\uc2  . Labour enjoyed colossal leads among every ethnic minority community. Even Indians, who are significantly less anti-Tory than other non-white groups, were four times as likely to vote for \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  as for \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A new study by the think tank Policy Exchange reveals the gravity of my party\u8217\'20\'19s predicament. It explodes the notion that there is a simple policy solution, such as changes in stop-and-search rules or \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  amnesties.\par \par \uc2 Different ethnic minorities are, as you would expect, heterogeneous. There are huge differences in levels of educational attainment, home ownership, private sector employment and virtually every other economic indicator. Bangladeshis and Jamaicans, Sikhs and Nigerians seem to have only one major political trait in common: they don\u8217\'20\'19t like voting Tory.\par \par \uc2 People of Pakistani origin are more likely to own their homes than white people, but this doesn\u8217\'20\'19t make them any likelier to vote for the homeowners\u8217\'20\'19 party. East African Asians are more likely to be business owners than white people, but this doesn\u8217\'20\'19t make them any likelier to vote for the entrepreneurs\u8217\'20\'19 party. People from black Caribbean backgrounds are more likely to attend church than white people (57 per cent as against 10 per cent), but this doesn\u8217\'20\'19t make them any likelier to vote for the party that, at least sometimes, does God.\par \par \uc2 For as long as I can remember, Conservative politicians have had only one message for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \b immigrant\b0  and ethnic minority voters}}}\uc2  : namely, \u8220\'20\'1Cyour values are our values\u8221\'20\'1D. By any measure, that appeal is failing. One reason is that it isn\u8217\'20\'19t always true. Plenty of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  arrive with fully developed political opinions, often retaining links to Left-of-Centre parties in their countries of origin.\par \par \uc2 While you can certainly argue that crossing half the world to make a new life implies a decent dose of initiative, not all \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is carried out in this fashion. Having a points-based system, where each successful applicant has had to beat others to citizenship, might attract enterprising people and, indeed, make them feel patriotic from the beginning. But much of our post-war \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was a statist project: government officials went to Commonwealth countries, recruited workers en bloc, paid their passage and put them to work in the public sector. It would be odd if that process had not produced a disproportionate number of Labour voters.\par \par \uc2 The phenomenon is not unique to the United Kingdom. In every Western country \u8211\'20\'13 with one important exception \u8211\'20\'13 \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  and ethnic minority voters are likelier than the general population to vote for Left-of-Centre parties. The exception is Canada where, at the last general election, newcomers were likelier to vote Conservative than native-born Canadians.\par \par \uc2 That result was largely the achievement of one man, Jason Kenney, now the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister and a strong contender to be \uc2 Stephen Harper\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s eventual successor as party leader. He grasped early on that first impressions matter. When people arrive in a new country, they are often badly off, and likely to be living in areas represented by the Left-of-Centre party. Their first political contact will probably be with their local councillor who, in between explaining how schools, taxes and housing policy work, will drop in some politics: \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t know how much you know about our party system here but, basically, we\u8217\'20\'19re the nice ones. The other lot didn\u8217\'20\'19t want you here in the first place.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The vital thing, Kenney realised, was for Conservatives to define themselves in the eyes of new arrivals rather than being defined by their opponents. That meant being where settlers were, being there early, and being there often.\par \par \uc2 Endlessly repeating, like some shamanistic incantation, that you \u8220\'20\'1Cshare the values\u8221\'20\'1D of this or that community doesn\u8217\'20\'19t work when people begin with the assumption that your values involve greed, selfishness or racism. Nor does turning up to a religious festival once a year serve to counter what the other side says about you. Outside Canada, Right-of-Centre parties have failed to understand the magnitude of the problem.\par \par \uc2 US conservatism had its greatest triumph in 1984, with the landslide re-election of Ronald Reagan. If that election were repeated today, with the Republicans taking the same shares of the vote among black, white and Hispanic voters in their present proportions, Walter Mondale would take the White House. Reagan used to say that Latinos were Republicans who didn\u8217\'20\'19t know it yet. His hope was that, as \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  moved up the social scale, their voting habits would shift accordingly. It isn\u8217\'20\'19t happening. And it isn\u8217\'20\'19t happening because, unlike Kenney\u8217\'20\'19s Conservatives, the Republicans haven\u8217\'20\'19t invested anything like enough effort in, say, running Spanish-speaking advice centres. At the last presidential election, nine out of every 10 advertisements on Spanish-language media were for the Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Britain\u8217\'20\'19s Tories have an analogous problem. Most Conservative associations have a sprinkling of black and Asian members, and almost all MPs make a point of visiting their local mosques and temples, but this doesn\u8217\'20\'19t begin to address the scale of the challenge. When \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are automatically visited by Conservatives on arrival; when Asian broadcast news networks hear more from the Tories than from Labour; when every association copies Andrew Rosindell\u8217\'20\'19s Romford, and runs events aimed specifically at Commonwealth \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , then, perhaps, the balance will begin to tilt.\par \par \uc2 How to get to that stage? Open primaries would help. In the 1980s, conscious of their electoral weakness among ethnic minorities, and desperate for the support of anyone with a black or brown face, the party sometimes promoted people who were even more eccentric than the average politician. Not any more. To pluck an example at random, the leader of the Conservative MEPs is Syed Kamall, the son of a bus driver from Guyana, a practising Muslim and a tax-cutting Eurosceptic who has fought his way to the leadership without the slightest help from the party hierarchy. There will be many more Syeds \u8211\'20\'13 that is, natural free marketeers \u8211\'20\'13 who have not joined the Tories for the most basic reason of all: no one has asked.\par \par \uc2 Let me end on a more hopeful note. At present, the Eurosceptic argument is being made disproportionately, and disastrously, in terms of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . If one side talks trade and investment while the other talks Romanians and Bulgarians, the first side will win. Which is why, as the referendum gets closer, I suspect that the rhetoric will switch from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , which has limited appeal to non-white Britons, to our global role. And that \u8211\'20\'13 I say this with certainty, having been making speeches about it for 20 years \u8211\'20\'13 is a message that elicits a warm response from people with family links in Commonwealth countries. An anti-EU campaign in which people from ethnic minorities were disproportionately active would have a benign impact on race relations. It might also, incidentally, give the Conservatives the opening they need.\par \par \uc2 Daniel Hannan is Conservative MEP for South East England\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140507ea57000un\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

The longlist was chosen from more than 180 plays from around the world. Scottish playwrights win the most nominations, including plays by David Harrower, David Leddy Rob Drummond and AJ Taudevin.\par \par \uc2 Also among those listed are Cannibals, below, by Rory Mullarkey; Grounded by George Brant, produced by the Gate Theatre, London; Quiz Show by Rob Drummond, produced by Traverse Theatre Company; Desolate Heaven by Ailis Ni Riain, produced by Theatre 503; Perfect Match by Gary Owen, produced by Paines Plough and \u210\'00\'D2ran M\u243\'00\'F3r, Glasgow, and Fleabag by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, produced by DryWrite Theatre Company. An award ceremony will take place at the Traverse on August 11, hosted by Joyce McMillan, the arts writer and theatre critic. Neil Murray, executive producer at The National Theatre of Scotland, said: "It is a very exciting longlist of plays, all of which have had a major impact on audiences. I look forward to selecting a winner."\par \par \uc2 Judging panelist Nicola McCartney, a playwright and lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, said: "The James Tait Black Awards are renowned for showcasing the very best of literature and we are delighted to celebrate the work of playwrights for a second year. The longlist is incredibly diverse and each play is of a remarkably high standard - it will be no mean feat to choose a shortlist."\par \par \uc2 The prize is judged by postgraduates and academics from the university. The shortlist will be announced in July. Last year the prize was awarded to Tim Price for his acclaimed play The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning" about the American soldier convicted of espionage for leaking military secrets.\par \par \uc2 The James Tait Black Memorial Prizes were founded in 1919. They are Britain's oldest literary awards. Past winners include D H Lawrence, Graham Greene, Aldous Huxley and Ian McEwan.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140507ea57000d1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Ukip's candidate to win its first Westminster seat acknowledged yesterday that his opponents would mine a record of statements about homosexuality, but insisted that his personal views had become "more relaxed".\par \par \uc2 The odds on Ukip winning the Newark by-election lengthened after it announced that it had chosen Roger Helmer to fight the critical contest on June 5. Party sources described the East Midlands MEP, who defected from the Tories two years ago, as a veteran campaigner who would give Ukip a fighting chance of taking the constituency, which was left vacant by the resignation of the disgraced Tory MP Patrick Mercer.\par \par \uc2 Activists opted for a man with strong local links but a past sure to be targeted by the Conservatives. Mr Helmer was rebuked by Mr Farage for suggesting that laws to allow gay marriage could lead to the legalisation of incest. He has previously stated that some found homosexuality "viscerally repugnant".\par \par \uc2 Speaking to The Times, he insisted that his views had changed. "I was raised in a very traditional home and I guess I grew up with those attitudes, but hell we are now in the 21st century and my position is exactly the same as the party's position: that we are a broadly libertarian party and what two consenting adults, or indeed more than two consenting adults, choose to do together is none of my business, none of the party's business and as far as we're concerned, they're free to get on with it."\par \par \uc2 Mr Helmer said that Ukip was right to fight against gay marriage. Asked if he would accept an invitation by friends to a same-sex wedding, however, he said: "I dare say I would."\par \par \uc2 He declines to say when his views changed or why or to discuss how he would react if a close family member came out as gay. "Twenty years ago I didn't like classical music, now I'm nuts about it," he said.\par \par \uc2 "I am not the anti-gay MEP; I am the MEP who is concerned about the major issues that affect this country today, who made a couple of remarks many years ago, which have been scraped off the bottom of the barrel and they are not the issue on which we are interested. The people of Newark are interested in issues that affect them today \u8212\'20\'14 they're interested in \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and energy prices and so on."\par \par \uc2 He said it would be an "amazing experience" to be Ukip's first MP and that he stood a good chance of overcoming the Tories' 16,000 majority. "We are going to be motivated, hyped up as a party, and I am very, very confident that we will have very large numbers of Ukip activists ... They think we've got a pretty good chance of winning and I think they're right."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage will seek to counter charges that Ukip today is racist by posing alongside black and ethnic minority candidates. Mr Helmer repeated his admission that not enough was done to weed out those with unsavoury views but maintained that the party was careful not to admit former BNP activists. "We are an insurgent party, we are a rather colourful party, we tend to attract colourful characters and a swash-buckling style. But we are extremely clear and extremely careful."\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140507ea570009f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Highstone, the company owned by the Ukip donor Paul Sykes, has \u163\'00\'A3253 million sitting on its books.\par \par \uc2 The \u163\'00\'A31.5\u8201\'20\'09million that Ukip spent on its European election poster campaign can hardly be said to have been money well spent. An \u8220\'20\'1C\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D who was photographed begging in the street turned out to be from Dublin, and a woman who was portrayed as an ordinary \u8220\'20\'1Cvoter\u8221\'20\'1D was unmasked as an aide to Nigel Farage, the party\u8217\'20\'19s leader.\par \par \uc2 Still, it looks as if there is a lot more fun and games to come as Paul Sykes, the party\u8217\'20\'19s principal donor and one of the wealthiest men in the country with a fortune that was once put at \u163\'00\'A3650\u8201\'20\'09million, has just seen his fortunes rocket.\par \par \uc2 The latest accounts for Highstone Group \u8211\'20\'13 his key company \u8211\'20\'13 show that it had \u163\'00\'A3253\u8201\'20\'09million sitting on its books as at March 31 2013 \u8211\'20\'13 a big increase on the \u163\'00\'A3197\u8201\'20\'09million it held in 2012. The 70-year-old Yorkshire-born businessman and property developer has promised to do \u8220\'20\'1Cwhatever it takes\u8221\'20\'1D to help Ukip in the European elections.\par \par \uc2 Last month, it was disclosed that Sykes, pictured, owned a luxurious apartment complex in Leeds city centre which employed Polish, Lithuanian and Portuguese workers. Sykes said he had been unaware that foreigners were working at the property and denied they had been employed because they were cheaper than British workers.\par \par \uc2 Sykes said Ukip wanted \u8220\'20\'1Ccontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D, rather than a complete halt to all labour movement across the EU. He warned that in Yorkshire \u8220\'20\'1Cthese people are just pouring in for reasons only they know and this unlimited \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is going to end in catastrophe\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mandrake/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Read more from Mandrake here}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/ThatTimWalker"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Follow Tim Walker on Twitter}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140507ea570018i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Italian police fear a new "Monster of Florence" is on the loose after a prostitute was found crucified on the outskirts of the city. A cyclist spotted her body taped by the wrists to a road barrier, with her head slumped back.\par \par \uc2 She was naked but for gym shoes and socks. Her clothes and handbag were found half a mile down the road.\par \par \uc2 The victim, killed on Sunday night, was identified as Andrea Cristina Zamfir, 26, a Romanian \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  and drug user. Preliminary evidence suggested that she died a slow and agonising death from internal bleeding after being assaulted with a metal rod. Bruising around her wrists indicated that she struggled to escape.\par \par \uc2 Police believe the killer may have struck before. Comparisons were being drawn with the infamous "Monster of Florence" who killed 16 people, preying on courting couples in lovers' lanes around Florence from 1968 to 1985 in a case that was never solved.\par \par \uc2 Pasquale Checcacci, a neighbour in his 80s who was summoned to the scene by the cyclist, was quoted as saying that the body "looked like it was crucified".\par \par \uc2 Ms Zamfir might have been saved if neighbours had intervened. Patrizia Ruggiero, 40, who lives in the last building on Via del Cimitero \u8212\'20\'14 Cemetery Road \u8212\'20\'14 said she had heard screams but was too scared to do anything. "At 11.30pm I heard moans. My puppy wasn't barking, but I was afraid because I was by myself. My boyfriend wasn't there, so I barricaded myself in my house," she told La Nazione newspaper.\par \par \uc2 The case has been assigned to the prosecutor Paolo Canessa, who worked on the "Monster of Florence" case. Ms Zamfir was at least the fifth woman to have been attacked in a similar way in the desolate area beneath a motorway flyover at the end of Via del Cimitero in Ugnano.\par \par \uc2 Another prostitute was taped naked to the same road barrier last year and assaulted in a similar manner, but was rescued when a resident heard her screams. She identified the suspect as a short, chubby, balding man in his 50s with a white car, who spoke Italian.\par \par \uc2 Also in the area in January, a young \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  fled an attacker and sought help from neighbours. Refusing to go to hospital, she asked for clothes and ran away. Another prostitute complained of a similar assault in the area in 2006.\par \par \uc2 A further attack took place last month when another prostitute was found tied to a pole nearby. She said her customer did not want to pay her.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140507ea5700053\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 From supermarket checkouts to cruise ships, interaction is the vital ingredient of life - particularly for elderly people\par \par \uc2 "You Just can't differentiate now between a robot and the very best of humans" \u8212\'20\'14 Isaac Asimov, I, Robot Nearly a third of workers fear losing their jobs to robots and computers, according to a poll published this week, which also found that 38 per cent believe the rise of machines threatens the human race.\par \par \uc2 Luddites they may be but in some ways they are right. For centuries the replacement of humans by technology has been seen as progress. At the start of the 19th century, 40 per cent of Britons worked in agriculture; now it is only 2 per cent. Instead of becoming a shepherd, my great-great-grandfather became a human calculator, working at the Greenwich Observatory with hundreds of other boys sorting astronomical data. By the next generation the aspirational working classes were beginning to move into service industries. Now even these jobs are becoming superfluous: we don't need as many bookkeepers, bank managers, travel agents, estate agents, librarians or police officers. We can shop for everything from milk to mansions at the click of a mouse and bank online. Even the police force is increasingly made up of computer analysts. \uc2 Google\uc2  has created driverless cars.\par \par \uc2 Only yesterday Cobal Light Systems announced that they have a machine that can scan the contents of bottles at airports. Soon we can do away with the security workers insisting we throw out our toiletries at Heathrow and Gatwick. When everyone has iris recognition at passport control we won't need as many \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  officials.\par \par \uc2 According to \uc2 Erik Brynjolfsson\uc2 , the co-author of The Second Machine Age and a professor at MIT, "It's one of the dirty secrets of economics \u8212\'20\'14 technological progress does grow the economy and create wealth but there is no economic law that says everyone will benefit."\par \par \uc2 There is an uneasy sense that we are going too far and that the withdrawal of human beings won't always be seen as an advance. Social interaction is important, even vital, in many industries and prevents our society becoming a lonely place.\par \par \uc2 Take supermarket checkouts. One of the few reasons for visiting a shop when it is easier to order online is the personalised service or the outing itself. Supermarkets increasingly expect us to use self-service tills but 84 per cent of shoppers still prefer staff to help them.\par \par \uc2 People crave contact. More than 40 per cent of elderly people \u8212\'20\'14 equivalent to four million pensioners \u8212\'20\'14 say that their TV or pet is their main source of company, according to a survey for Age UK. They may interact with their grandchildren on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , their children may phone at the weekend, but they can no longer have a quick natter with the butcher or baker.\par \par \uc2 They probably see a different doctor each time they have an illness and the hairdresser may provide their only regular encounter with another individual. Loneliness in old age is twice as bad for your health as obesity, scientists have warned.\par \par \uc2 One cruise ship operator explained to me: "I think the reason we are now so popular is that the elderly go on cruises not to travel, but to recreate a community. They like the chance to have a natter with the beautician, talk to the waitresses and build up a few relationships."\par \par \uc2 It sounds old-fashioned but companies that recognise this need for human interaction are starting to reap the benefit.\par \par \uc2 The big four supermarkets are struggling against discount stores but Waitrose has bucked the trend by being people-friendly. My parents shop there for the free coffee and because my father, who has memory problems, has been given a personalised shopper to help him round the aisles. Waitrose has signed up to become a dementia-friendly company and as a result is a haven for the elderly.\par \par \uc2 Lloyds and Nationwide are working on how to tackle forgotten pin numbers, and establish a "dementia-friendly protocol" for elderly customers \u8212\'20\'14 a set of principles that it is hoped all banks, building societies and insurance companies could follow.\par \par \uc2 Pret A Manger\uc2  is another leader in this field. The sandwich chain only employs "people who are friendly and lively". Pret staff aren't required to have GCSE maths and English often isn't their first language, but they do need to "treat customers as if they are guests in their own home". The American sociologist Arlie Hochschild calls this "emotional labour", and it has proved successful for Pret.\par \par \uc2 Human contact is the new luxury. "Our retailers are suffering not just because of price but because, too often, their workers don't seem to care," says Octavius Black, CEO of Mind Gym.\par \par \uc2 The same applies in healthcare and education. New technology can now diagnose some ailments using artificial intelligence techniques but reassuring nurses will always be important for a patient's recovery. Schools increasingly use whiteboards and online lessons but teachers will still be in demand to inspire and encourage.\par \par \uc2 Children should be taught empathy as well as IT in the classroom. People skills and good manners should be considered as important as maths or creativity because they will lead to jobs where they can show they are indispensable. As John F Kennedy said when the first robots came off the production lines: "Man is still the most extraordinary computer of all."\par \par \uc2 We don't need bank managers, estate agents or librarians\par \par \uc2 Reassuring nurses and inspiring teachers will always be in demand\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140507ea5700030\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 If Thomas Piketty thinks that today's capitalism has failed, he needs to explain what he is going to replace it with\par \par \uc2 In 1973 Joseph-D\u233\'00\'E9sir\u233\'00\'E9 Mobutu, had an idea. As part of his drive to be seen as the intellectual leader of Africa, a role for which he was spectacularly unsuited, he would embark on a vast economic experiment. Zaireanisation.\par \par \uc2 What had once been the Congo Free State was pursuing what Mobutu termed a policy of "authenticity", and Zaireanisation would be its economic counterpart. It involved nationalising foreign-owned assets \u8212\'20\'14 farms, plantations, commercial enterprises, the entire industrial sector.\par \par \uc2 Mobutu was a bit hazy on detail and his favourite subjects at school had always been demagoguery and rhetoric rather then economics. So the rules governing who got the assets and who managed the industries were vague to the point of non-existence.\par \par \uc2 The result was disaster. Zaire became a kleptocracy with, as Michela Wrong records in her brilliant history of the president's regime, Mobutu as the king thief. A new social class \u8212\'20\'14 the Big Vegetables \u8212\'20\'14 was born, handing out assets to themselves and their relatives. Prices rose, businesses shut, jobs disappeared, growth came to an end and imports of Mercedes-Benz cars hit an African record.\par \par \uc2 By the time that even Mobutu realised his error, it was too late. He called for foreign investors to come back to Zaire, but who would want to do that? Let me explain why I am bringing this up. Over the past month the French economist Thomas Piketty has been on a world tour supporting his new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the title a deliberate echo of Marx. He has been advancing the idea that capitalism will produce an increasingly unequal society. And his reception has been rapturous.\par \par \uc2 The enthusiasm for his book has mainly come from the left. Not, however, exclusively. There is general agreement that he has produced interesting data that, at the very least, poses a troubling question: if returns on capital grow faster than the economy, as Piketty suggests has happened at most points in capitalism's history, might we be heading towards a grossly unequal society based on inherited wealth? The Frenchman says that we have only enjoyed a brief holiday from this tendency because of progressive policy and because two world wars destroyed great fortunes. We are now heading back to the past.\par \par \uc2 His data and his writing have won him positive reviews. However, even the commentators most convinced by this account of the future finish with what they see as a small admission, one the author makes too. Piketty's solution to the problem he predicts \u8212\'20\'14 a global wealth tax and 80 per cent top income tax rate \u8212\'20\'14 is not very "realistic". Which I think means, "is one of Baldrick's cunning plans".\par \par \uc2 Yet this admission is not, not remotely, a small one. It is not just an afterthought in a critique of capitalism that the author can't think of a better idea. It is not a side point that in the 150 years or so since Marx's Capital, every single attempt at an alternative to capitalism has been a growth-destroying, libertycrushing, dictator-producing, starvation-creating, murderous disaster.\par \par \uc2 Stupid though it was, Mobutu's Zaireanisation wouldn't win the international socialist stupidity competition. I am pretty sure Mao's Great Leap Forward, in which peasants melted down their cooking pots to make steel and then died of hunger, would edge him. And the Kims in North Korea would be justifiably miffed if their effort didn't at least net them a "highly commended".\par \par \uc2 When I was an undergraduate debating for hours in Florries, the LSE student union coffee shop, I used to think that one day I would grow up and work out how the great utopian schemes of my left-wing fellow students would actually work. During the Occupy demonstration outside St Paul's in 2012 I finally realised that I was doomed to die not knowing.\par \par \uc2 The proposals that Piketty makes may not be on the epic scale of Mobutu, but they are not obviously more practical. Or desirable. I have a friend who always makes the point that all politics is autobiography, so perhaps I might explain my argument using a little family history.\par \par \uc2 I come from exactly the sort of family that Piketty writes about. The sort whose inherited fortune was destroyed by the war. My grandfather was a wealthy man. He and his brother had built a major industrial iron business, employed many people and owned factories and workshops. Stalin took it all, sent him to Starobelsk labour camp and my father and grandmother to the borders of Siberia. By the time the family arrived in London they were on national assistance.\par \par \uc2 I hope I can be excused for not seeing this as an entirely good thing. In other words, the destruction of inheritance by the war might conceivably play a benign role in a book on inequality (the social evil that Piketty entirely aims at), but it would certainly play a malign one in a book on liberty.\par \par \uc2 In any case, as it happens there was no increase in equality. My grandfather's property wasn't enjoyed by the people. The Soviets and the Nazis tried running the factory before closing it down; the wealth was destroyed not redistributed.\par \par \uc2 And the family home? It became a holiday apartment for communist leaders in Ukraine. The bitter truth of most schemes for redistributing large chunks of wealth is that, rather than being spread, it is held by the state and enhances the power, wealth and status of the Big Vegetables.\par \par \uc2 Piketty, I am sure, doesn't see his policy as one of confiscation. Yet my grandfather's property had to be removed at the point of a gun. His imprisonment was a necessary part of the deal. He wouldn't have carried on doing business in Ukraine if he knew it would be taken from him. Who is going to build a fortune that they will not be permitted to enjoy and that will not be allowed to pass to their children? There is one more relevant piece of family history. My father did not inherit the factory and its responsibilities. He came here penniless. But he did inherit from both his parents a belief in the power of knowledge and he had an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 's work ethic. He rebuilt in this country.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Piketty's work has many assumptions and a good deal of heroic extrapolation. It is a hypothesis. Against this is the certainty that in a free enterprise system, education for all and hard work promises prosperity and liberty under law.\par \par \uc2 A more modest claim than the great dreams of the anti-capitalists, but less likely to yield to the tyranny of the Big Vegetables.\par \par \uc2 daniel.finkelstein@thetimes.co.uk\par \par \uc2 Redistribution of wealth usually enhances the power of Big Vegetables\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140507ea570000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

The seat is currently held by employment minister and ex-TV presenter Esther McVey, who must keep hold of the Tories' thin northern foothold and build on it for her party to stand any chance of an overall majority.\par \par \uc2 If the Lib Dems cannot hang on to St Austell and Newquay in Cornwall, they face certain wipeout nationwide.\par \par \uc2 The party's rookie MP there, Stephen Gilbert \u8212\'20\'14 who won notoriety with his successful campaign to scrap the Pasty Tax in 2012 \u8212\'20\'14 is trying to protect a delicate majority of 1,312.\par \par \uc2 But if he succeeds, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  can kiss goodbye to a second term in No10.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Chesterfield in Derbyshire will show us whether Labour will be able to crush the Lib Dems in the north.\par \par \uc2 Labour's Toby Perkins took the legendary Tony Benn's old seat off the Lib Dems in 2010 by just 549 votes.\par \par \uc2 But Labour needs at least a dozen of their seats to be sure of taking power and must do much better here next time.\par \par \uc2 And in Southampton Itchen, Labour must again hold on to one of the smallest majorities in the country \u8212\'20\'14 just 192 \u8212\'20\'14 to oust the Tories from Downing Street.\par \par \uc2 So we will keep coming back to Wirral West, St Austell and Newquay, Chesterfield and Southampton Itchen to ask the big questions, such as ... Have the Tories done enough to rescue the economy, or should we all be better off by now? Is Ed Miliband's planned radical overhaul of capitalism what the country needs or does that scare the hell out of people? Will voters forgive Nick Clegg's Lib Dems for breaking so many promises? And, perhaps most importantly of all, will Ukip fade away like they did before the last two General Elections? Here, EMILY FAIRBAIRN, HARRIET HERNANDO and TOM GOODENOUGH visit our four constituencies to hear from four typical examples of voters \u8212\'20\'14 firsttimers, mothers, business owners and pensioners, who in each region are pictured in that order.\par \par \uc2 t.newtondunn@the-sun.co.uk FIRST-TIME VOTER Rebecca Harrison, 18, who studies health and social care at college, lives in Chesterfield.\par \par \uc2 She said: "My main concern is money. I am a care leaver, which means I've grown up in care and now live on my own. As I am studying at college I can claim income support of \u163\'00\'A357 a week.\par \par \uc2 "It's hard to survive on that. I do get rent and council tax paid but I have to pay for food and bills. I'd like more help for young people like me to succeed.\par \par \uc2 "I will vote Labour. Labour seems to care more about those who have less."\par \par \uc2 MOTHER Rebecca Goodwill, 20, who works parttime in a shop, has lived in Chesterfield all her life. She has an 18-month-old daughter and a partner.\par \par \uc2 She said: "I worry about what kind of world I've brought my daughter into. I'm worried about an ageing population where the younger ones seem to come second, with all the cash going to the elderly.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not sure there will be pensions by the time I retire, never mind by the time my daughter does.\par \par \uc2 "I was not old enough to vote in the last election and I won't vote at the next one. Every MP does the opposite of what they promise, so what is the point of voting?" BUSINESS OWNER Keith Todd, 59, who owns No 10 The Tea Room in Chesterfield, said: "My main political concern is too many taxes for small businesses. I don't like how big firms get away with paying very little while small businesses get the brunt of the whole lot.\par \par \uc2 "There is also a lot of red tape for small businesses. When you try to get something going you're hit by obstacles. I voted Tory in the last General Election because I was sick of Labour.\par \par \uc2 "Next time I'd vote for the Coalition because I think it's good for Britain. Having two parties at different ends of the spectrum dilutes their controversial ideas.\par \par \uc2 "But without that I will go Liberal."\par \par \uc2 PENSIONER Kenneth Collingwood, 71, who lives in Chesterfield, said: "My main political concern is definitely Europe.\par \par \uc2 "I want out. We are moving towards a political Europe where we are unable to make our own rules and regulations.\par \par \uc2 "I'd like us to be able to manage our own borders where we are able to say who is allowed to come into our country.\par \par \uc2 "At the moment Chesterfield is middling.\par \par \uc2 I've been around the city today and was appalled at the amount of rubbish.\par \par \uc2 "I voted for the local Labour candidate last election and will probably vote for them next time.\par \par \uc2 "Ukip is a force to be reckoned with, and if they had a candidate here they would get my vote."\par \par \uc2 IN the 1980s this Derbyshire town had Tony Benn as its MP, then the Lib Dems seized it in 2001 before Labour's Toby Perkins, above, won it back in 2010. Voters here mainly work in service industries and the jobless rate is five per cent.\par \par \uc2 FIRST-TIME VOTER Kimberley Brown, 22, a care assistant from Newquay, said: "My biggest concern is employment. I've been unemployed and so has my dad.\par \par \uc2 "It leads to depression and it needs to stop. I know what it's like, first-hand.\par \par \uc2 "I think taxes should be reduced for people who earn under \u163\'00\'A315,000 like me.\par \par \uc2 "Apart from that I am quite apathetic as I just can't relate to people in power.\par \par \uc2 "Transport is our biggest issue here. It is really hard to get out or into Cornwall and I don't think it is being addressed.\par \par \uc2 "As I'm 22 I have never voted before but if I had to vote tomorrow I would vote Conservative. I like \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and I think he has done quite a good job."\par \par \uc2 MOTHER Rebecca Lightfoot, 32, is a construction firm administrator and mum of three children under 12, from Penryn. Her husband Darren, 33, is a digger driver at a quarry.\par \par \uc2 She said: "I think the amount families are helped with childcare needs to be looked at. Both my husband and I work but sometimes it just feels like you are working to pay for childcare.\par \par \uc2 "In Cornwall we are forgotten about. My parents have been trying to sort out some planning permission and it was a nightmare. In the end the MP had to help out but I think it is easier to do things like that in other parts of the country.\par \par \uc2 "At the last election I voted Conservative but if I had to vote tomorrow I'd go Liberal Dem - they seem to think about families."\par \par \uc2 BUSINESS OWNER Ben Skinner, 29, a self-employed surfboard maker, from Perranporth, said: "I am mostly concerned about unemployment. There is a lot around here but I think steps are being taken to improve this. We have an MP who wants to stick up for our area. Obviously we in Cornwall have recently got our recognition as a minority, which is going in the right direction.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't vote in the last election as I was abroad at the time. If the next one was tomorrow I'd vote for the Green Party but I am undecided. I think the Green Party fights for a lot of things I believe in."\par \par \uc2 PENSIONER William Rooney, 72, a retired postman, from Newquay, said: "My main concern is employment. I don't think when people do find a job they are being paid enough and these zero-hour contracts are bad.\par \par \uc2 "I think down here in the south-west we are just forgotten. A lot more needs to be done to make funding for us here fairer.\par \par \uc2 "If there was an election tomorrow I would vote Labour. Ukip are really a branch of the British National Party. No good will come out of it at all."\par \par \uc2 IN the 2010 General Election, Lib Dem Stephen Gilbert, above, just beat his Tory rival in this newly formed Cornish seat.\par \par \uc2 Mebyon Kernow, the Cornish independence party, won its highest share of the vote in any seat here but still FIRST-TIME VOTER Lucinda Mercer, 19, from West Kirby is a student. She said: "I'm going to university to do a medical course so I will be exempt from tuition fees, which are shockingly high and very unfair.\par \par \uc2 "I want to see the cost of going to uni come down so everybody who wants to go can do so. We are told to try hard and excel but if you don't have the money then that becomes a barrier to progressing higher.\par \par \uc2 "I'd also like the \uc2 NHS\uc2  to give more money to students on medical courses so they don't have to also work two jobs.\par \par \uc2 "The Wirral is a perfect example of the divide between rich and poor - the west is prosperous but the east is struggling.\par \par \uc2 "I am going to vote based on the best policies for everyone."\par \par \uc2 MOTHER Mum-of-two Jennifer Pearson, 48, is from West Kirby.\par \par \uc2 She said: "I am worried about the economy, lack of jobs, unemployment and zero-hours contracts. They don't affect me but it concerns me. They are wrong.\par \par \uc2 "I would like to see more employment.\par \par \uc2 Tuition fees worry me. There is too much debt being put on young people.\par \par \uc2 "I lean more to Labour. I don't think it is fair to say Ukip is racist - that is harsh.\par \par \uc2 "It has some valid points. We don't have a lot of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  here but you can see it might be a problem for others."\par \par \uc2 BUSINESS OWNER Steve Mercer, 53, from West Kirby, is director of embroidered garment firm Custom Clothing.\par \par \uc2 He said: "As a small business owner, what I'd like from the next government is some assurance over rates.\par \par \uc2 "There is big fear among local businesses that they are going to fail and be squeezed out. I would like more incentives for small businesses, shops and restaurants.\par \par \uc2 "There is a rapid turnover of property usage by shops due to failed projects, maybe as a result of business costs. I am undecided on who to vote for. The last seven years have been about survival so I've been unable to analyse policies."\par \par \uc2 PENSIONER Frank Noble, 73, is from West Kirby. He said: "For me the biggest issue is the cost of living. I haven't got that many political concerns, really. I suppose car parking is one thing that could be improved.\par \par \uc2 "I voted for the Lib Dem candidate last time round. I will be voting Labour this time because of the way their candidate, Margaret Greenwood, has stood against coal gasification (igniting coal reserves to produce gas) in the Dee Estuary.\par \par \uc2 "Ukip is a oneman band."\par \par \uc2 THIS affluent constituency is traditionally a safe Tory area, but fell to Labour in 1997. It was reclaimed by the Conservatives in 2010 with a 2,436 majority.\par \par \uc2 The MP is former TV host Esther McVey, above, who is Minister for Employment.\par \par \uc2 FIRST-TIME VOTER Teaching assistant Alex Cunningham, 22, lives in Bitterne. She said: "My biggest concern is the lack of jobs in the town.\par \par \uc2 "It's nowhere near as easy to find work as people make out.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of my friends are looking for work and it gets you down.\par \par \uc2 "More should be spent on the town centre to lure shoppers and new businesses to create jobs. There's nothing round here, so it's even harder to find jobs.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know much about politics, so if the election was tomorrow, I'd struggle.\par \par \uc2 "If they reached out to younger voters, I'm sure more of us would get involved."\par \par \uc2 MOTHER Louise Dunleavy, 22, lives in Woolston with daughter Lexie Mae, two.\par \par \uc2 She said: "I'm disappointed with the lack of council housing available. There's this idea that it's so easy for young mums to get council houses.\par \par \uc2 "But actually I haven't had any help at all and I've been trying for two years.\par \par \uc2 "I've been left with no choice but to rent privately, which is OK for now but if they start bringing in more changes to housing benefit I don't know what I'll do.\par \par \uc2 "I've never voted. I don't know anything about politics. I'm focused on my girl."\par \par \uc2 BUSINESS OWNER Married father-of-two Phil Ainslie, 49, owns sweet shop The Candy Store in Woolston, where he lives.\par \par \uc2 He said: "Big businesses are seeing improvements as the economy picks up but it will be a while yet for smaller businesses. I thought things would be booming, but it's difficult, especially with The Co-op supermarket down the road. "There needs to be more done to encourage support for local businesses. I always voted Conservative until 2008, when I started to feel disillusioned. I haven't voted since.\par \par \uc2 "No parties deliver on their promises.\par \par \uc2 That's why a lot of people are intrigued by Ukip. I'm not racist but perhaps we need to be more strict on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 PENSIONER Retired cook Mary Farino, 62, lives in Bitterne with her husband Giulio, 72.\par \par \uc2 She said: "I'm worried about the lack of primary school places for children in the area. My grandson struggled to find a place and my foster daughter's son was allocated schools miles from his home.\par \par \uc2 "I fear the Itchen constituency is failing compared to neighbouring Eastleigh, where they spend loads on places for kids to enjoy. All we get is betting shops.\par \par \uc2 "I voted Tory last year and will do the same next election.Ukip are all over the media but I've yet to see a policy from them on UK infrastructure."\par \par \uc2 THIS constituency covers the east of the south coast port city. Itchen is seen as Labour territory, though the Tories held it in the 1980s. It has returned Labour members for the past five terms.\par \par \uc2 MP John Denham, above, is not standing next year.\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140507ea57000he\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

"I was afraid to stay here all night.\par \par \uc2 "I slept for no longer than an hour, so I am pretty tired today."\par \par \uc2 As Adam heard the smash outside his first thought was "not my car".\par \par \uc2 "I was afraid when I moved into this area about my car and my nightmare came true yesterday," he said.\par \par \uc2 Despite being wary of future attacks, the family own the house, so moving is not an option at this stage.\par \par \uc2 "We have no choice but to sleep here tonight," Adam added.\par \par \uc2 "Police promised they would keep an eye on my house and the street, they will do it for a couple of days. I don't know what happens in the future."\par \par \uc2 While he remains baffled as to why they were targeted, Adam said the attackers knew what they were doing.\par \par \uc2 "It happened because I'm not local, maybe racial discrimination. They smashed the Polish car and Polish house.\par \par \uc2 "I'm a quiet person who hasn't caused any problems. I don't know if it was personal or random."\par \par \uc2 Residents were disgusted at the attack. A 32-year-old woman said: "They are a family who both go to work, they own the house and this is how they are repaid?" A 40-year-old neighbour helped the family by phoning the police.\par \par \uc2 A Polish neighbour (38) said she didn't feel safe in her own home.\par \par \uc2 "We have done nothing wrong to the local people. I can't understand why something like this happened because we are from a different country," she said.\par \par \uc2 The attack follows a spate of hate crimes in the east of the city and comes days after graffiti saying 'locals only' was daubed on three properties on Roslyn Street.\par \par \uc2 Jim Nicholson MEP called the attacks an "absolute disgrace" and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness blamed the UVF.\par \par \uc2 10 ways this \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  community has enriched our lives 1 Polish Cultural Week has been held at the Waterfront Hall for the past eight years.\par \par \uc2 Kasia Garbal, of the Polish Educational and Cultural Association, said the festival aimed to break down barriers and fight prejudice through arts and culture.\par \par \uc2 2 Many new food shops are open in Belfast, such as the Karolina (right), specialising in Polish foods and delicacies.\par \par \uc2 They serve not only the Polish community. Many local people go in as well to buy bread and produce they can't buy elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 It also creates jobs and boosts the economy through taxes and rates.\par \par \uc2 3 During the Second World War, Polish soldiers fought bravely against the Nazis and 145 made the ultimate sacrifice in the Battle of Britain to defend the UK from German invasion. A number of Polish air crew died in Northern Ireland and are buried here.\par \par \uc2 One Spitfire with a local link, the City of Derry, was flown by 315 Squadron, a Free Polish squadron in the RAF.\par \par \uc2 4 The contribution of Polish workers in many local industries - \u8212\'20\'14 such as factories and food-processing businesses - \u8212\'20\'14 has helped keep companies in Northern Ireland secure.\par \par \uc2 They have filled labour shortages - \u8212\'20\'14 something particularly evident in Moy Park. Polish workers also fill important skill gaps in areas such as IT, and as doctors and nurses.\par \par \uc2 The Polish community is also integrating into Northern 5 Ireland's political life. Anna Ochal-Molanda, who is originally from Poland, become the first member of her Eastern European community to stand for election.\par \par \uc2 6 Belfast's first Polish restaurant, Cracow City, opened on the Cregagh Road in 2008.\par \par \uc2 The restaurant was revamped in 2010 under new ownership and is now called The Belvedere.\par \par \uc2 7 Polish Saturday School in Belfast educates children about the Polish language, culture and traditions. There are 10 schools across Northern Ireland at present.\par \par \uc2 8 Polish priests and ministers help plug the gap in churches and some preach in parishes throughout Northern Ireland.\par \par \uc2 9 With more than 30,000 Polish people living in Northern Ireland, the beleaguered housing market has undoubtedly benefited from their presence.\par \par \uc2 10The cultural diversity of schools and universities here has increased thanks to the large numbers of Polish children here. One Polish pupil came first in Irish in Northern Ireland in both verbal and written GCSE examinations.\par \par \uc2 Document WBEL000020140507ea5700091\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

An "\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 " who was photographed begging in the street turned out to be from Dublin, and a woman who was portrayed as an ordinary "voter" was unmasked as an aide to Nigel Farage, the party's leader.\par \par \uc2 Still, it looks as if there is a lot more fun and games to come as Paul Sykes, the party's principal donor and one of the wealthiest men in the country with a fortune that was once put at \u163\'00\'A3650million, has just seen his fortunes rocket.\par \par \uc2 The latest accounts for High\u8211\'20\'13stone Group \u8211\'20\'13 his key company \u8211\'20\'13 show that it had \u163\'00\'A3253million sitting on its books as at March 31 2013 \u8211\'20\'13 a big increase on the \u163\'00\'A3197million it held in 2012.\par \par \uc2 The 70\u8211\'20\'13year\u8211\'20\'13old Yorkshire\u8211\'20\'13born businessman and property developer has promised to do "whatever it takes" to help Ukip in the European elections.\par \par \uc2 Last month, it was disclosed that Sykes, pictured, owned a luxurious apartment complex in Leeds city centre which employed Polish, Lithuanian and Portuguese workers. Sykes said he had been unaware that foreigners were working at the property and denied they had been employed because they were cheaper than British workers.\par \par \uc2 Sykes said Ukip wanted "controlled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ", rather than a complete halt to all labour movement across the EU. He warned that in Yorkshire "these people are just pouring in for reasons only they know and this unlimited \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is going to end in catastrophe".\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140507ea57000an\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 A CONVICTED Palestinian drug dealer is finally being thrown out of Britain after using the Human Rights Act to remain in the country for an eight\u8211\'20\'13year crime spree.\par \par \uc2 Mahmoud Jaber, 31, had been peddling heroin and crack cocaine to fund a lavish lifestyle, serving three jail terms and racking up a string of convictions during his stay in Britain, a judge was told.\par \par \uc2 Despite being informed he would be deported as long ago as 2006, Jaber \u8211\'20\'13 whose father lives in the UK \u8211\'20\'13 used article eight of the Human Rights Act to appeal successfully against his removal, arguing he had the right to family life.\par \par \uc2 Since his appeal, Jaber has been convicted of a series of drug trafficking offences, complaining that he was "emotionally scarred into taking drugs" because he was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank.\par \par \uc2 After a number of legal battles and appeals, an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  judge ruled that Jaber, of Accrington, Lancs, had an "appalling history" and ordered that he be returned to his home country. It is thought that Jaber's case will have cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds. The saga began when Jaber moved to Accrington to join his father in February 1992. He was granted indefinite leave to remain in 1998 and attempted to get British citizenship, but in 2003 was convicted of a series of offences including resisting police and possessing Class A drugs.\par \par \uc2 The following year he was jailed for four years for dealing crack cocaine and heroin. In April 2006 Jaber was told he would be deported but in May the following year he lodged an appeal under article eight and won the right to stay.\par \par \uc2 In 2008 he was repeatedly brought back into court on drugs charges. Then in October, 2010, at Burnley Crown Court, Jaber was convicted of intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine and manufacturing crack and was jailed for six years. In 2011, he was warned he faced deportation but in 2012 he again appealed. Last year he was convicted of money laundering and jailed for an extra 21 months.\par \par \uc2 His deportation appeal was heard in Bradford, West Yorks, in October. The panel concluded that his offending was "too serious to outweigh his claims to remain".\par \par \uc2 Jaber finally appealed to the Upper \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Tribunal in Manchester.\par \par \uc2 Rejecting his appeal, Judge Richard Chalkley said: "Given the appellant's appalling history \u8230\'20\'26 the appeal fails."\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140507ea570006r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 PM: We have undersold our work for women\b0\par\par\uc2 Christopher Hope   \par \uc2 535 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph\par \uc2 DT\par \uc2 1; National\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 DAVID CAMERON\uc2  has told his MPs they need to be more boastful of the work done by the Government to promote women's policies.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister's call came as new figures showed the gender pay gap had fallen since 2010.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron said last night that the Government was guilty of "underselling" its policies which are aimed at women.\par \par \uc2 Nicky Morgan, the women's minister, said that Government figures showed the gender pay gap had fallen and been "almost eliminated for full time workers under 40".\par \par \uc2 Other achievements included legislating for the Married Couple's Allowance, as well as an increase in the number of female Tory MPs. She said that 30 per cent of the party's candidates at the 2015 general election were women. She also told the MPs that the number of women on FTSE100 boards had increased from 12.5 per cent to 20.7 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron has asked Conservative grassroots supporters to back the Government's economic policies.\par \par \uc2 In an email to the Tory party's 134,000 supporters last night, the Prime Minister said he was "asking you to back the plan that is turning our country around".\par \par \uc2 In the 260\u8211\'20\'13word message, Mr Cameron wrote: "The Conservatives are the ones with the long\u8211\'20\'13term economic plan that is working.\par \par \uc2 "If we want to continue this Great British revival, and keep on turning our country around, we've got to keep working through this plan. That's why today, I'm asking you to back the plan that is turning our country around."\par \par \uc2 The message was timed to be sent out one year from next May's general election. Mr Cameron said: "For each of those 365 days, the Conservatives have one clear message: we are the team that is turning Britain around."\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron said the Government had a "serious, long\u8211\'20\'13term economic plan" to cut the deficit, reduce income tax, cut \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and cap welfare.\par \par \uc2 He said that the Conservatives would demonstrate that this "plan is working for families across our country". He said: "From the ashes of the Great Recession we are building a Great British revival. But make no mistake: all this is at stake a year from now. Labour's only plans are for more spending, more borrowing, more debt."\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband has said he has "more intellectual self\u8211\'20\'13confidence" than \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 . The Labour leader suggested that he has a better and clearer understanding of Britain's needs than the Prime Minister. In an interview with the London Evening Standard, Mr Miliband, who like Mr Cameron, attended Oxford and took a degree in politics, philosophy and economics, said: "I'm not the guy who says, 'Oh I just want to be prime minister because it is a place to reach'. I actually have strong beliefs about how to change the country. This is an incredibly powerful weapon.\par \par \uc2 "I look at \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  across the Dispatch Box and I think to myself, I'm the one with the intellectual self\u8211\'20\'13confi\u8211\'20\'13dence because I actually know what I believe and I don't need Lynton Crosby to tell me."\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140507ea5700060\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH Established 1855\par \par \uc2 The Care Bill returns to Parliament today, for what are expected to be its final stages in the Lords before becoming law. Since the consequences of an ageing population represent one of the greatest social challenges of the era, it is hard to think of a more important piece of legislation to have come before MPs and peers in recent years.\par \par \uc2 The Bill is the most ambitious attempt yet to put in place a comprehensive system for residential and home care in England. It will introduce a cap on costs from 2016, reducing \u8211\'20\'13 but not removing \u8211\'20\'13 the need for the elderly to sell their homes to cover bills. Everyone will have a legal entitlement to a personal care budget, which they can receive as a direct payment to spend as they wish. In addition, carers will have the right to support from their local council.\par \par \uc2 These reforms should remove uncertainty, allow people to plan for their old age and, crucially, enable the financial services industry to start fashioning insurance and saving products to cover people's bills. But while these initiatives are welcome, no one should be under any illusion that they represent a panacea. A debate continues to rage over who should take the greatest responsibility for dealing with the impact of ageing \u8211\'20\'13 the state or families.\par \par \uc2 There is always the danger that the enactment of legislation is regarded as a guarantee of state intervention. But the plain fact is that the rising costs of care will make it impossible for the taxpayer to bear the burden of looking after a rapidly rising number of elderly people, many of whom will be suffering from dementia. As we report today, figures from \uc2 Public Health England\uc2  show that some 50,000 people are quitting work every year to look after a relative afflicted with dementia, and this is likely to become more commonplace despite the care reforms.\par \par \uc2 It is, of course, laudable that family members should choose to care for their relatives \u8211\'20\'13 following the admirable pattern seen in many \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  communities, as the Lib Dem MP \uc2 Simon Hughes\uc2  recently pointed out. Furthermore, as Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, has written in this newspaper, it is possible to live with dementia and to adapt to its presence if it is diagnosed early. Today, the \uc2 Alzheimer's Society\uc2  will formally launch the latest stage of its Dementia Friends programme, which helps people learn about dementia and encourages individual empathy and compassion.\par \par \uc2 Inevitably, dealing with what Mr Hunt called the "quiet crisis" of ageing will involve a cultural upheaval, one best addressed by the state working to support families rather than supplant them.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140507ea5700056\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

The 23\u8211\'20\'13year\u8211\'20\'13old was picked up by a lifeboat a mile off the French coast in his Robinson Crusoe\u8211\'20\'13style craft made out of a table leg and wooden planks, with a bed sheet for a sail. For comfort and buoyancy, he added a float wrapped in a tarpaulin on which he sat, just inches above the sea, whose temperature is a bone\u8211\'20\'13chilling 10C at this time of the year. Such apparent foolhardiness has led many to denounce his idiocy and sympathise with his desperation. Yet he is also worthy of praise for having the nerve to set out in such a ramshackle boat. Our \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  laws do not offer access to the country for gumption and courage. If they did, this young man would be at the head of the queue.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140507ea5700054\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 THE 'Great British Revival' is at stake in the general election a year today, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  warned last night.\par \par \uc2 With a poll showing Ukip doing the Tories serious damage, the Prime Minister urged supporters to stick with the Government's economic plans.\par \par \uc2 Otherwise, he said, the Labour Party would take charge and spend and borrow more.\par \par \uc2 Tory strategists accept that many of their supporters will back Ukip as a protest in next month's European poll - and must be brought back into the fold before the general election.\par \par \uc2 An analysis by YouGov showed that 42 per cent of those who voted Conservative in 2010 plan to back Ukip in the European elections this month.\par \par \uc2 Of 9,000 people questioned by the polling group, almost 2,000 said they would vote for the anti-European party if a general election were held now. Tory defectors outnumbered by three to two the Labour and Lib Dem defectors together.\par \par \uc2 YouGov's Peter Kellner said: 'Farage should not claim that his party is winning votes from Labour on anything like the scale that it is taking them from the Conservatives.'\par \par \uc2 Former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, now a leading pollster, says Mr Cameron remains his party's 'biggest electoral asset' but time is running out to persuade voters that he and his colleagues are on their side.\par \par \uc2 He argues that Ukip is 'an ideal conduit for the blowing of mid-term raspberries' but those who want their vote to count in 2015 will have to choose between the main parties.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron, who addressed MPs and peers with his chief election strategist Lynton Crosby last night, said: 'The general election is one year away. For each of those 365 days, the Conservatives have one clear message: we are the team that is turning Britain around.\par \par \uc2 'We have set out a serious, long-term economic plan: reducing the deficit, cutting income taxes, backing business, capping welfare, reducing \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , delivering the best schools and skills - and that plan is working for families across our country.'\par \par \uc2 He said the deficit had been cut by over a third, the economy was one of the fastest growing in the developed world and 1.5million more people were in work.'\par \par \uc2 He added: '\b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is down. Welfare has been capped. And something I'm very proud of: today 250,000 fewer children are being taught in failing schools. All this means more peace of mind for families, more young people with the chance to get on in life, and more financial security.\par \par \uc2 'From the ashes of the Great Recession we are building a Great British Revival. All this is at stake a year from now. Labour's only plans are for more spending, more borrowing, more debt - more of the same that got us into the mess.'\par \par \uc2 Comment - Page 14\par \par \uc2 Sarah Vine - Page 15\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140506ea570001y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A YEAR from today, the country will go to the polls in a General Election about which the only thing that can be confidently predicted is the date, fixed by law for the first time in our history.\par \par \uc2 That apart, this paper finds it hard to recall a time when there were so many confusing factors to obscure the likely outcome of the contest.\par \par \uc2 If the normal rules of politics applied, the Tories would by now be clear favourites for a second term in office.\par \par \uc2 After all, the Chancellor's strategy has been vindicated - as the \uc2 OECD\uc2  confirmed yesterday, when it upgraded its growth forecasts yet again, predicting that Britain will be the developed world's fastest growing economy in 2014.\par \par \uc2 True, the fast-inflating housing bubble poses a threat to the recovery. But with 100,000 jobs a month being created, the economy has performed far more robustly than most dared hope four years ago.\par \par \uc2 Despite all this, however, the Tories remain stuck below 35 per cent in the polls - trailing the party that caused much of the trouble in the first place.\par \par \uc2 Not that Labour's modest lead gives Ed Miliband much to celebrate. Indeed, on the crucial questions of leadership and economic stewardship, he remains consistently (and, as most would agree, deservedly) behind the Tories.\par \par \uc2 Can he maintain Labour's overall lead until polling day? Or, as the moment of truth approaches, will voters recoil from trusting his party again?\par \par \uc2 As for the Lib Dems, it seems safe to predict that they will suffer a hammering at the polls, after trading their principles for office. The only questions are how many votes they will lose - and to whom.\par \par \uc2 Which brings us to the two greatest imponderables of the 12 months ahead. One is the Scottish referendum - and if that goes the nationalists' way (God forbid!), the landscape will change so dramatically that all bets will be off.\par \par \uc2 The other is the Ukip phenomenon. Without doubt, Nigel Farage's raggle-taggle crew will perform strongly in this month's council elections, while they are favourites to top the poll for the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  on the same day.\par \par \uc2 But can they maintain their momentum until May 2015? Or will their support melt away, as it did after the Euro-elections of 2004 and 2009?\par \par \uc2 What is clear is that \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  cannot rely on good economic news alone to bring electoral success, as in the past.\par \par \uc2 Over the coming year, he must persuade voters his party is not merely economically reliable but actually capable of delivering a better life for them and their families.\par \par \uc2 Similarly he should trumpet Tory successes - from Iain Duncan Smith's groundwork for welfare reform to Michael Gove's progress on school standards.\par \par \uc2 He must also focus mercilessly on the dangers of Mr Miliband's plan to drag Britain back into a 1970s nightmare of price controls, nationalisation, class warfare and industrial strife.\par \par \uc2 But the Prime Minister needs to convince Conservatives who have defected to Ukip that he is on their side - ramming home the messages that he is truly determined to control \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and that only the Tories will deliver a euro-referendum.\par \par \uc2 There remains a substantial small-c conservative majority in Britain, believing in patriotism, self-reliance, hard work and the family. Mr Cameron has 365 days to unite it behind him.\par \par \uc2 An insult to justice\par \par \uc2 NOBODY should criticise the police for taking allegations of historic sex abuse seriously. But it was indefensible to keep Freddie Starr on bail for 18 months before the case against him was dropped.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, yesterday's photographs of him graphically illustrate the heavy toll on his health inflicted by his wait for a decision.\par \par \uc2 This was punishment without trial - and an insult to justice.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140506ea570000k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 DOOMED BY THIS POISONED CHALICE\b0\par\par\uc2 BY STEPHEN GLOVER   \par \uc2 1,095 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Christopher Patten\uc2  looks back on his long and often distinguished career as a public servant, it is unlikely that he will remember his three-year stint as Chairman of the BBC Trust with much fondness.\par \par \uc2 Nor is it probable that he will be particularly upset that major heart surgery has led him to stand down from his job with immediate effect a year earlier than he had intended.\par \par \uc2 To be fair to him, he was passed a chalice when he accepted the post that was more dripping with poison than he or most reasonable observers could have possibly guessed.\par \par \uc2 The outgoing director-general, \uc2 Mark Thompson\uc2 , had fostered a culture in which sometimes mediocre \uc2 BBC\uc2  employees received enormous pay-offs. Bureaucracy had mushroomed wildly, and so had the pay of senior executives and 'stars'.\par \par \uc2 The hope was that with his vast political experience at the highest level - after leaving Westminster politics in 1992 he had been the last Governor of Hong Kong, as well as a European Commissioner - Lord Patten would be able to knock heads together, and take charge of a bloated and self-satisfied organisation.\par \par \uc2 In the event he must be judged to have failed. He was never able to grasp the Corporation's deep-seated difficulties with the acuity he had shown in previous roles, and he showed a surprising lack of sure-footedness in coping with unforeseen problems, of which the Jimmy Savile scandal was undoubtedly the greatest.\par \par \uc2 For a time, though, things went smoothly enough. Lord Patten was evidently more than happy to see the back of \uc2 Mark Thompson\uc2 , and engineered the appointment of \uc2 George Entwistle\uc2 , an apparently competent \uc2 BBC\uc2  insider, as his replacement. He was partly attracted to Mr Entwistle because he believed he could control him.\par \par \uc2 The high point of Lord Patten's reign was the \uc2 BBC\uc2 's outstanding coverage of the Olympics in the summer of 2012. Though the Chairman of the BBC Trust could hardly claim personal credit, he could legitimately bask in the Corporation's triumph.\par \par \uc2 But the plot began to unravel in the autumn of 2012 after an ITV programme alleged that Jimmy Savile, whose long career had been nurtured by the \uc2 BBC\uc2 , had been a serial sexual abuser on a scarcely credible scale, with some of his assaults taking place on \uc2 BBC\uc2  premises.\par \par \uc2 Allegations surfaced that, almost a year earlier, in December 2011, \uc2 Mark Thompson\uc2  had been told about the stories concerning Savile a few weeks before the \uc2 BBC\uc2  aired a saccharine Christmas tribute to the monster. A BBC2 Newsnight exposure of him had also been suspiciously canned.\par \par \uc2 As criticism of the Corporation mounted, and some of its executives traded blows, Lord Patten might have seemed the ideal person to stamp his authority on the scandal. In fact he was notably slow off the blocks, though eventually a report by \uc2 Nick Pollard\uc2 , a former Sky TV executive, was commissioned.\par \par \uc2 Things went from bad to worse in November 2012. Mr Entwistle was forced to resign as director-general of the BBC after only 54 days in the job when it emerged that Newsnight had falsely implicated the former Tory Party Treasurer Lord McAlpine in a North Wales child abuse scandal.\par \par \uc2 The best that could be said about this affair is that Mr Entwistle was skewered in a coruscating interview by the \uc2 BBC\uc2 's own John Humphrys on the Today programme. One of the Corporation's best journalists betrayed a keener sense of its failures than any of its executives.\par \par \uc2 Having backed a horse that had ridden through the first fence, Lord Patten did not endear himself to the growing band of critics by taking it upon himself to crown as his successor Lord Hall, a former \uc2 BBC\uc2  employee who over a decade earlier had not been considered director-general material.\par \par \uc2 The question remains why someone considered such a safe pair of hands should have proved less than adept. I suspect that the answer is that, with the \uc2 BBC\uc2  in the state that it was, it needed a full-time chairman to help sort it out.\par \par \uc2 But Lord Patten had other irons in the fire. He is Chancellor of Oxford University, and has been a paid adviser or non-executive director to a clutch of companies, including BP. All inevitably made demands on him, leaving him less time for the \uc2 BBC\uc2  than was desirable, especially when it was in crisis.\par \par \uc2 Lord Patten didn't succeed in ending the culture of huge pay-offs and excessive executive pay as quickly as he should have done. It was not until last September that he admitted, at a hearing of the Public Accounts Committee, that pay-offs to senior executives had been 'eye watering', adding that he had failed to protect the interests of the licence-fee payer by clamping down on the issue earlier.\par \par \uc2 Needless to say, he always acquitted himself with great aplomb on these occasions, brushing aside MPs' concerns with marvellous insouciance. Accusations that he has not always been as transparent as he might have been were revived last December when he refused to release documents to MPs about the \uc2 BBC\uc2 's madly extravagant and aborted Digital Media Initiative, which cost the licence payer \u163\'00\'A3100 million. He said that publishing them would inhibit 'free and frank exchanges between \uc2 BBC\uc2  staff.'\par \par \uc2 Such lordly condescension may have gone down well when Lord Patten was the Governor General of Hong Kong or a European Commissioner. It may possibly impress the dons of \uc2 Oxford University\uc2 . But it has not suited, or helped, the \uc2 BBC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 What progress Lord Patten was making in producing the \uc2 BBC\uc2 's case for its next Charter Review in 2016 - when its future role in our national life will be examined - is not clear. But the Corporation needs a more vigorous defence than Lord Patten seemed likely to give.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 BBC\uc2  has to convince ordinary licence payers that it has not grown too big, that its bureaucracy is still not too large, and that its executives and stars are not overpaid. It has to confront charges of bias, especially in its reporting of Europe and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In fact, a thorough going review of the future of the \uc2 BBC\uc2  is required. Lord Patten was not the man for that task, any more than he has been the right person to steer it through its recent tribulations.\par \par \uc2 A fresher and more self-critical broom is needed than \uc2 Christopher Patten\uc2  could ever supply. That said, his announcement does signal the end of a remarkable career in public life.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140506ea570000h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

He had been due to serve until next spring and oversee the start of the Corporation\u8217\'20\'19s tricky charter renewal negotiations.\par \par \uc2 But Lord Patten, who previously had heart surgery seven years ago, said he had been ordered to rest for six weeks and would be left unable to work at the \u8216\'20\'18same full pace\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 He added: \u8216\'20\'18It would not be fair to my family to continue as before; and equally it would not be fair to the BBC and those it serves not to be able to give that commitment which the role demands.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Finding a successor as chairman of the BBC Trust will be the first major challenge for the new Culture Secretary, Sajid Javid.\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid, who took up his post only last month, will oversee the selection process before an appointment is approved by the Prime Minister and given royal assent.\par \par \uc2 Among possible candidates are\u160\'00\'A0 presenter David Dimbleby, who applied for the job in 2004, and former \uc2 Sony\uc2  boss \uc2 Sir Howard Stringer\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 BBC ROLE WAS JUST THE LATEST IN A CAREER IN THE FIRING LINE\par \par \uc2 Chairing the BBC Trust was just the latest in a string of high profile - and often controversial - roles Lord Patten has held.\par \par \uc2 Born in 1944, he studied history at Balliol College before joining the Republican campaign machine in New York and later the Conservative Research Department, which he later ran from 1974 and 1979.\par \par \uc2 He was elected MP for Bath in 1979 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming Minister for Overseas Development in 1986.\par \par \uc2 Margaret Thatcher then handed him the poisoned chalice of becoming Environment Secretary - in charge of the deeply-unpopular Poll Tax.\par \par \uc2 Under John Major he became Tory party chairman in charge of the 1992 election campaign, but lost his own seat to Lib Dem Don Foster.\par \par \uc2 In July 1992 Patten was handed the role of the 28th and last Governor of Hong Kong, to oversee the handover to China.\par \par \uc2 He famously wept during his speech at the handover ceremony.\par \par \uc2 By 1999 he was a European Commissioner, where he remained until 2004.\par \par \uc2 He became BBC Trust chairman in 2011 after Labour-backed Sir Michael Lyons did not have his term renewed.\par \par \uc2 However, the Coalition is said to be keen on appointing a woman to the role for the first time, with former Pearson boss Marjorie Scardino being heavily tipped last night.\par \par \uc2 Lord Patten\u8217\'20\'19s tenure saw the BBC hit by a series of scandals, starting with the revelations that former BBC DJ Jimmy Savile had been a serial paedophile. Then in 2012, his choice as new director-general, George Entwistle, was forced out after only 54 days amid another Newsnight row.\par \par \uc2 And last year he was quizzed by the public accounts committee over the BBC Trust\u8217\'20\'19s role in the \u163\'00\'A3369million pay-offs handed to departing BBC staff, including \u163\'00\'A360million to senior managers.\par \par \uc2 Last night, Tory MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the culture, media and sport committee, said Lord Patten had had a \u8216\'20\'18torrid\u8217\'20\'19 time.\u160\'00\'A0 \u8216\'20\'18I am genuinely sad that Lord Patten has had to stand down in these circumstances,\u8217\'20\'19 he said. \u8216\'20\'18He has had to oversee a relentless succession of disasters at the BBC, mostly not of his own making.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18The problem is, many potential candidates won\u8217\'20\'19t want to touch this job with a barge pole. The BBC\u8217\'20\'19s governance structure is fundamentally flawed and the job is in many ways impossible.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 BBC director-general Tony Hall said: \u8216\'20\'18I have enjoyed working with Chris over the last year, he is staunch believer in the BBC and he has brought his vast experience to the role of chairman of the BBC Trust.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18He has steered the BBC through some of its most difficult days. In undertaking this role he brought\u160\'00\'A0 unrivalled experience, wisdom, and an overwhelming desire to ensure that the BBC remains the best public service broadcaster in the world.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid wished Lord Patten a\u160\'00\'A0 \u8216\'20\'18successful and speedy recovery\u8217\'20\'19,\u160\'00\'A0 adding that he had \u8216\'20\'18embraced the challenges that have confronted the BBC, putting in place improvements to governance and building a stronger executive team helping the BBC to move forward with confidence\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Labour culture\u160\'00\'A0 spokesman Harriet Harman said: \u8216\'20\'18Lord Patten... helped the BBC to turn a corner under new leadership with Tony Hall.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18He proved himself a firm friend of the BBC and its values.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Lord Patten\u8217\'20\'19s successor will have two years to launch a defence of the licence fee as the Government reviews the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s charter.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, critics have called for the charge to be scrapped and replaced with a subscription model, while others have suggested the BBC Trust should be scrapped.\par \par \uc2 STEPHEN GLOVER: DOOMED BY THIS POISONED CHALICE\par \par \uc2 When Christopher Patten looks back on his long and often distinguished career as a public servant, it is unlikely that he will remember his three-year stint as Chairman of the BBC Trust with much fondness.\par \par \uc2 Nor is it probable that he will be particularly upset that major heart surgery has led him to stand down from his job with immediate effect a year earlier than he had intended.\par \par \uc2 To be fair to him, he was passed a chalice when he accepted the post that was more dripping with poison than he or most reasonable observers could have possibly guessed.\par \par \uc2 The outgoing director-general, Mark Thompson, had fostered a culture in which sometimes mediocre BBC employees received enormous pay-offs. Bureaucracy had mushroomed wildly, and so had the pay of senior executives and \u8216\'20\'18stars\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 The hope was that with his vast political experience at the highest level \u8211\'20\'13 after leaving Westminster politics in 1992 he had been the last Governor of Hong Kong, as well as a European Commissioner \u8211\'20\'13 Lord Patten would be able to knock heads together, and take charge of a bloated and self-satisfied organisation.\par \par \uc2 In the event he must be judged to have failed. He was never able to grasp the Corporation\u8217\'20\'19s deep-seated difficulties with the acuity he had shown in previous roles, and he showed a surprising lack of sure-footedness in coping with unforeseen problems, of which the Jimmy Savile scandal was undoubtedly the greatest.\par \par \uc2 'The BBC has to convince ordinary licence payers that it has not grown too big and that its executives and stars are not overpaid'\par \par \uc2 For a time, though, things went smoothly enough. Lord Patten was evidently more than happy to see the back of Mark Thompson, and engineered the appointment of George Entwistle, an apparently competent BBC insider, as his replacement.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 He was partly attracted to Mr Entwistle because he believed he could control him.\par \par \uc2 The high point of Lord Patten\u8217\'20\'19s reign was the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s outstanding coverage of the Olympics in the summer of\u160\'00\'A0 2012.\par \par \uc2 Though the Chairman of the BBC Trust could hardly claim personal credit, he could legitimately bask in the Corporation\u8217\'20\'19s triumph.\par \par \uc2 But the plot began to unravel in the autumn of 2012 after an ITV programme alleged that Jimmy Savile, whose long career had been nurtured by the BBC, had been a serial sexual abuser on a scarcely credible scale, with some of his assaults taking place on BBC premises.\par \par \uc2 Allegations surfaced that, almost a year earlier, in December 2011, Mark Thompson had been told about the stories concerning Savile a few weeks before the BBC aired a saccharine Christmas tribute to the monster. A BBC2 Newsnight exposure of him had also been suspiciously canned.\par \par \uc2 As criticism of the Corporation mounted, and some of its executives traded blows, Lord Patten might have seemed the ideal person to stamp his authority on the scandal.\par \par \uc2 In fact he was notably slow off the blocks, though eventually a report by Nick Pollard, a former Sky TV executive, was commissioned.\par \par \uc2 Things went from bad to worse in November 2012. Mr Entwistle was forced to resign as director-general of the BBC after only 54 days in the job when it emerged that Newsnight had falsely implicated the former Tory Party Treasurer Lord McAlpine in a North Wales child abuse scandal.\par \par \uc2 The best that could be said about this affair is that Mr Entwistle was skewered in a coruscating interview by the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s own John Humphrys on the Today programme. One of the Corporation\u8217\'20\'19s best journalists betrayed a keener sense of its failures than any of its executives.\par \par \uc2 Having backed a horse that had ridden through the first fence, Lord Patten did not endear himself to the growing band of critics by taking it upon himself to crown as Entwistle\u8217\'20\'19s successor Lord Hall, a former BBC employee who over a decade earlier had not been considered director-general material.\par \par \uc2 The question remains why someone considered such a safe pair of hands should have proved less than adept. I suspect that the answer is that, with the BBC in the state that it was, it needed a full-time chairman to help sort it out.\par \par \uc2 But Lord Patten had other irons in the fire. He is Chancellor of Oxford University, and has been a paid adviser or non-executive director to a clutch of companies, including BP.\par \par \uc2 All inevitably made demands on him, leaving him less time for the BBC than was desirable, especially when it was in crisis.\par \par \uc2 Lord Patten didn\u8217\'20\'19t succeed in ending the culture of huge pay-offs and excessive executive pay as quickly as he should have done.\par \par \uc2 It was not until last September that he admitted, at a hearing of the Public Accounts Committee, that pay-offs to senior executives had been \u8216\'20\'18eye watering\u8217\'20\'19, adding that he had failed to protect the interests of the licence-fee payer by clamping down on the issue earlier.\par \par \uc2 Needless to say, he always acquitted himself with great aplomb on these occasions, brushing aside MPs\u8217\'20\'19 concerns with marvellous insouciance.\par \par \uc2 Accusations that he has not always been as transparent as he might have been were revived last December when he refused to release documents to MPs about the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s madly extravagant and aborted Digital Media Initiative, which cost the licence payer \u163\'00\'A3100 million.\par \par \uc2 He said that publishing them would inhibit \u8216\'20\'18free and frank exchanges between BBC staff\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Such lordly condescension may have gone down well when Lord Patten was the Governor General of Hong Kong or a European Commissioner.\par \par \uc2 It may possibly impress the dons of \uc2 Oxford University\uc2 . But it has not suited, or helped, the BBC.\par \par \uc2 What progress Lord Patten was making in producing the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s case for its next Charter Review in 2016 \u8211\'20\'13 when its future role in our national life will be examined \u8211\'20\'13 is not clear. But the Corporation needs a more vigorous defence than Lord Patten seemed likely to give.\par \par \uc2 The BBC has to convince ordinary licence payers that it has not grown too big, that its bureaucracy is still not too large, and that its executives and stars are not overpaid.\par \par \uc2 It has to confront charges of bias, especially in its reporting of Europe and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In fact, a thorough going review of the future of the BBC is required.\par \par \uc2 Lord Patten was not the man for that task, any more than he has been the right person to steer it through its recent tribulations.\par \par \uc2 A fresher and more self-critical broom is needed than Christopher Patten could ever supply. That said, his announcement does signal the end of a remarkable career in public life.\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140506ea56006my\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 The moment French coast guard rescued Afghan who was trying to sail to England on a raft made from six planks of wood and a bedsheet\b0\par\par\uc2 PETER ALLEN and ARTHUR MARTIN   \par \uc2 915 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par 01:25\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

Port patrol cars were on the quay alongside them within a few minutes.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Three of the men were plucked out of the water relatively easily, but one went missing and got into difficulty into deep water.\par \par \uc2 The body of an Eritrean who also tried to swim across the harbour drowned in exactly the same spot last October.\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of migrants from outside the EU are living in a camp yards from the perimeter fence of Calais port.\par \par \uc2 Charities say there are more than 650 in the town, the greatest number since the closure of the Red Cross camp at Sangatte in 2002 \u8211\'20\'13 and they are taking advantage of gaps in security and a minimal police presence.\par \par \uc2 On March 9 an Albanian man was killed on a motorway outside the town. Three days later, Ethiopian Mesfin Germa was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port.\par \par \uc2 The body of a 25-year-old Ethiopian man, Senay Berthay, was found in Calais\u8217\'20\'19s\u160\'00\'A0 Batellerie dock on March 14 and the next day a fellow Ethiopian in his 20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a\u160\'00\'A0 vehicle transporter.\par \par \uc2 It is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction.\par \par \uc2 The migrants play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police as they try their luck at getting to Britain.\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140506ea56005ei\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Hope for a future where racial tensions are rare\b0\par\par\uc2 Simon Kelner KELNER'S VIEW   \par \uc2 560 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par \uc2 i\par \uc2 IIND\par \uc2 1ST\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd.  All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 News\par \par \uc2 It is richly ironic that a rightwing think-tank should author a report which creates such a positive impression about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , ethnic integration and this polyglot nation. Positivity may be in the eye of the beholder, and I accept there are some people who will be alarmed by the findings of this Policy Exchange document, notably the headline conclusion that, by midway through this century, non-white people could make up a third of the British population.\par \par \uc2 But the picture presented in the report - a comprehensive study of Britain's black and ethnic minority groups - is one, I believe, which offers hope for a future where racial and ethnic tensions become increasingly rare. For example, there is the welcome trend towards inte-gration between minority groups themselves - illustrated by the fact that one in eight multi-person households includes representatives of more than one ethnicity - and plenty of evidence that people from ethnic backgrounds are more likely to associate themselves with Britain, or what they perceive to be British values, than the white population. Even The Daily Telegraph found the report cheering. "It is a reminder what a unifying concept Britain is," it said in a leading article. "Britain is a nation that so many of its newest citizens are proud to call their own."\par \par \uc2 I'm not in the habit of quoting other organs, but this is highly indicative of a changing attitude from those who would traditionally see hazard in the report's findings, and would bemoan the loss of British identity as a result of these seismic demographic changes. By 2050, Britain will have a young, educated, and, in the main, motivated workforce - for instance, the average British Bangladeshi is 22 years old, compared with an average age of 39 for a white Briton - and, in a highly competitive global market, this is more likely to give the UK an edge than a knowledge of morris dancing.\par \par \uc2 English - rather than British - identity is seen as the province of white people. Of those polled, 64 per cent of white people described their sole nationality as English, and only 14 per cent felt their nationality was British. These are significant figures, and a new English nationalism has been fed largely by a disenfranchised white working class who, understandably, feel insecure about the changes they see around them. English nationalism is a force that could yet undermine social harmony, and would explain why some of us feel uncomfortable about the increasing preponderance of the flag of St George (something we're going to see rather a lot of throughout the month of June).\par \par \uc2 I have always, however, found the idea of a homogenous English, or indeed British, identity rather moot. And on the day when statistics show that parts of the UK are poorer than rural Poland, and meanwhile London is the richest city in Europe with an average spending power per capita of \u163\'00\'A371,000, the belief that we are one nation, unified by a love of cricket, warm beer and Morecambe and Wise is outdated in the extreme. The social and economic inequality in Britain is such that we are a massively divided nation. We should be thankful that at least our ethnic minorities have a more holistic view of our country.\par \par \uc2 Document IIND000020140507ea570003x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Features | THE BIG READ More studies than ever are finding that circumcision is a life saver - but still its detractors believe that it's tantamount to child abuse. JEREMY LAURANCE tries to settle the argument\par \par \uc2 It is the world's most commonly performed surgical procedure - but more than any other it now divides global medical opinion.\par \par \uc2 Male circumcision - the removal of the foreskin, normally performed soon after birth or at puberty - has become the subject of a bitter dispute between medical authorities on either side of the Atlantic.\par \par \uc2 At issue is a small sheath of double folded skin and muscle, rich in blood vessels and nerve endings, whose function remains unclear. Claims have been made that its removal leaves the head, or "glans", of the penis exposed, reducing sensation and sexual pleasure, but no consensus on this, or on much else, exists. The \uc2 World Health Organisation\uc2  says of the foreskin, there is "debate about its role".\par \par \uc2 Supporters of circumcision say its removal brings significant medical advantages that outweigh any risks. Last month alone two studies appeared extolling its health benefits, with one specialist claiming that it provides protection (against urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases) on a par with childhood vaccination and that to fail to offer it to the parents of newborn boys should be regarded as unethical.\par \par \uc2 Yet last October, the \uc2 Council of Europe\uc2  passed a resolution condemning the practice as a "violation of the physical integrity of children" and calling for a public debate with the aim of banning the practice "before a child is old enough to be consulted". Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland joined forces to call for a ban, following the lead a year earlier from a German regional court in Cologne, which ruled that the practice amounted to bodily harm and banned it for infants and young boys below the age of consent.\par \par \uc2 That provoked an angry reaction from Jewish and Muslim leaders, among whose communities ritual circumcision has been performed for centuries, which was reignited by the \uc2 Council of Europe\uc2  resolution. They blamed the attacks on left-wing secularists and right wingers fearful of the influence of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from Muslim countries.\par \par \uc2 In March, leaders of the \uc2 Council of Europe\uc2  tried to calm the debate with a letter advising parliamentarians against further attempts to target ritual circumcision on the grounds that "the protection of children is provided by existing international instruments".\par \par \uc2 The issue is so sensitive that looking at the evidence, weighing it up and deciding what is best for children, as doctors are supposed to do, is virtually impossible.\par \par \uc2 Recognising this, most medical organisations have for decades stayed aloof from the issue, noting merely that surgery is rarely medically necessary, except in the tiny minority of cases where the foreskin will not retract. They have preferred to leave it to parents and the public to decide whether the procedure is ethical when carried out for religious or other non-medical reasons. However, in 2008, an editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine, the world's premier medical journal, put an end to that cosy consensus by noting the accumulating evidence that removal of the foreskin could protect against a number of sexually transmitted diseases.\par \par \uc2 Circumcision reduces by 35 per cent the risk of infection with human papilloma virus, a cause of genital warts in both sexes and the principal cause of cervical cancer in women. It also provides protection against the herpes virus, reducing the infection risk by 25 per cent. It is thought likely to protect against syphilis, too, but the sample size in the NEJM report was too small to be significant.\par \par \uc2 By far the most dramatic effect, however, is its protective effect against infection with HIV, with a 50-60 per cent reduction in risk among circumcised men. Adult male circumcision is now widely seen as among the world's best defences against the spread of Aids, and is being used across sub-Saharan Africa in huge campaigns backed by millions of dollars.\par \par \uc2 Although HIV is a smaller problem in Western countries (and there is no evidence that circumcision is protective for gay men), human papilloma virus and herpes virus cause a heavy burden of disease and, in the case of cervical cancer, thousands of deaths (and millions in the developing world).\par \par \uc2 The NEJM concluded that the new evidence was strong enough to serve as a "call to action" for professional societies to re-examine their policies on circumcision. The American Academy of Paediatrics was the first to respond by establishing a taskforce and in 2012 it published an updated position statement.\par \par \uc2 Having previously advised against the routine circumcision of boys, the Academy now said parents should be educated about the benefits and risks and it should be up to them to decide. It urged insurance companies to pay for the procedure, adding: "The benefits of newborn male circumcision justify access to this procedure for those families who choose it."\par \par \uc2 This was in stark contrast to the Royal Dutch Medical Association, which, two years earlier, had concluded that the benefits claimed for circumcision were unproven, the risks underestimated and the procedure was "medically unnecessary" and violated the human rights of underage boys on whom it was imposed. It advocated a "strong policy of deterrence".\par \par \uc2 That view was subsequently adopted by the Scandinavian countries and Iceland following advice from their children's ombudsmen. The anti-circumcision lobby finally triumphed in October when the parliamentary assembly of the \uc2 Council of Europe\uc2  passed the resolution condemning male circumcision as a "violation of the physical integrity of children" by a margin of 78 votes to 13.\par \par \uc2 The resolution also called for a public debate with the aim of "reaching a consensus on the rights of children" and adopting "specific legal provisions to ensure that certain operations will not be carried out before a child is old enough to be consulted".\par \par \uc2 Following the vote, the children's ombudsmen from Scandinavia and Iceland issued an unprecedented joint resolution calling for a ban. Thus, the US and mainland Europe are now deeply divided over male circumcision. The differing views reflect the differing prevalence of the practice on either side of the Atlantic. Around 80 per cent of men in the US are circumcised, with higher rates in whites and lower rates in Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 In the UK, the rate is 16 per cent according to a national survey in 2000, with lower rates in France (14 per cent) Germany (11 per cent) and Spain (less than 2 per cent). Circumcision is near universal in Muslim countries. Worldwide, about 30 per cent of men are circumcised according to the \uc2 World Health Organisation\uc2 . Rates are falling in all Western countries. In the US, it is estimated that infant male circumcision has declined to 55 per cent (from 79 per cent in the 1970s). In 2012, researchers predicted that if the rate fell to one in 10 - in line with Europe - it could add more than $4bn in health costs from avoidable sexually transmitted infections.\par \par \uc2 In the UK, about a third of men were circumcised in the 1930s, with higher rates among families of higher social class. The rate dropped sharply after an influential paper appeared in the BMJ in 1949 which attacked the routine performance of circumcision on the grounds that the foreskin was naturally fused to the glans at birth and hence inability to retract it was no grounds for removal until age five and that the procedure had a small but significant fatality rate.\par \par \uc2 Today, medical organisations in the UK continue to stand aloof from the growing rift between Europe and America over the issue. The \uc2 British Medical Association\uc2  says the consent of both parents should be obtained for a circumcision carried out for religious or cultural (ie, non-therapeutic) reasons and supports the right of doctors to conscientiously object to being involved in a non-therapeutic procedure.\par \par \uc2 The UK Royal College of Paediatrics has declined to follow its US counterpart by setting up a taskforce to review the evidence. It argues that HIV is relatively uncommon in the UK and there is little heterosexual transmission within the country. There is a national campaign to vaccinate girls against cervical cancer, which is expected to significantly reduce the incidence of the disease, and the incidence of herpes is substantially lower than in the US. On public health grounds, it would therefore be difficult to justify the costs of carrying out 300,000 neonatal circumcisions a year - the annual number of male births - when the money could be more effectively used in other ways.\par \par \uc2 For individuals, however, the judgement is more difficult. British parents with connections in sub-Saharan Africa might consider circumcision for their baby sons worthwhile if it seemed likely that when they grew up they might spend time there as sexually mature adults. The operation is simpler and less traumatic when performed in infancy - but at that age, of course, the child himself has no say.\par \par \uc2 A decade ago, as evidence for the preventive effect of circumcision was starting to emerge, some specialists predicted that it would lead to a sudden leap in demand across the world. A minor op that offered protection against three diseases that killed millions worldwide would surely be hard to resist, they said.\par \par \uc2 It hasn't happened. There has been a surge of interest in circumcision among parents in South Africa, the country with the highest number of Aids cases in the world, and in other parts of Africa devastated by the disease.\par \par \uc2 But enthusiasm has not spread. Arguments over human rights have increasingly come to trump arguments over health - at least in Europe. What is noteworthy is how, on the basis of the same evidence, medical authorities in different countries have reached fundamentally different views. The vast majority of circumcisions are carried out not for health reasons but for religious reasons, to incorporate a child into a community or because some parents want their sons to be like their fathers. That, it seems, is unlikely to change.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140507ea570002k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News | Sketch\par \par \uc2 As we emerged blinking from the darkness of the \uc2 Ministry of Sound\uc2 , it was hard not to believe that we had been dreaming.\par \par \uc2 In so far as there is a Liberal Democrat nightclub, this is it, made available for their local elections launch by Lord Palumbo, the party donor ennobled last year. Whether the dance floor is at its thrilling best at 11am is more doubtful. Trance music is a club speciality and a trance is what everyone seemed to be in. Some young activists had stood around sipping juice before the event like reluctant participants in a singles' party, and then applauded politely when Clegg's short speech was over. There were no questions; no ecstasy (in either sense) and no Vince Cable.\par \par \uc2 An amiable man called Austin Rathe had earlier said his job as "head of members and supporters" was a "good place to be at the moment". But hang on Austin, you cannot be serious! With the polls showing the party at 9 per cent and possibly losing all its \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  seats, isn't it a perfectly dreadful place to be? Ah, no. While people may not be voting for the party they are joining it. At the rate of 1,000 per month! Then Austin rather spoilt things by reading out reasons given by the new recruits. "It looked like you needed the help". And, "I've joined everyone else so now it's your turn". And, "The wife".\par \par \uc2 This showed, of course, that the Lib Dems are grown-up enough not to pretend everything is hunky-dory. Nick Clegg said that the Lib Dems were the one party which didn't take its supporters "for granted". Which isn't hard since there are so few of them.\par \par \uc2 Beside castigating Labour and Tory councils for their wastefulness, he pointed to the party's steadfast adherence to "unfashionable causes" like the environment and overseas aid. The party supported "all of these", he proclaimed. (Except that there were only two.)\par \par \uc2 The warm-up had been a naffly amateurish version of Play Your Cards Right, the 1980s game show which wasn't even that riveting when compered by Bruce Forsyth. Austin said it was the press office's idea and that it was a bit of mystery to him why they were doing it. Nevertheless he valiantly persuaded the contestants to guess the scale of various council money-wasting atrocities outlined on giant playing cards. While \u163\'00\'A326,000 may seem a lot for Labour Slough to spend on "a spy plane with heat-sensitive cameras to find illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 ", maybe that's just the ticket for seeing off Ukip. And the "motivational magician" on which the Tory Cotswold council spent \u163\'00\'A319,000, is exactly what the Lib Dems now need.\par \par \uc2 The MP Duncan Hames was present with his infant son, Andrew, in a baby sling. Many decades hence, will Andrew Hames be able to dine out on his presence at one of the first events marking The (second) Strange Death of Liberal England?\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140507ea570000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw160\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2400\pichgoal600

"I did a week's residency at the college [Queen's University], and I thought, 'What a wonderful place'.\par \par \uc2 "When I came back, the Troubles were just beginning \u8212\'20\'14 the first civil rights marches \u8212\'20\'14 and it was a bit bewildering because I didn't really know the political situation in Northern Ireland at all. But I was just struck by the huge friendliness of the people. There's a lot of brio, a lot of spirit, in the town.\par \par \uc2 "It was incredible to me to think that there could be so much bad feeling between the communities. That's probably not entirely gone in some respects, but it's so much better than it was. It's wonderful to see the city resurrected and thriving musically."\par \par \uc2 And Ralph says there was never any fear or trepidation about visiting a place that at the time was mostly renowned for sectarian violence: "Perhaps naively, I thought music transcended anything like that. When you sit down to listen to music, you don't ask your neighbour what 'card' they're carrying. You become an audience.\par \par \uc2 "And music has a healing power, anyway. I'm not talking about the 'singing nun' here \u8212\'20\'14 I'm talking about any music. It's something that touches the spirit, the mind, the soul of people, and it draws attention to the things that unite rather than divide."\par \par \uc2 Throughout the 1970s and '80s, Ralph continued to include Belfast on his tours, despite the worsening conflict. "I used to do it every year at one time," the crooner recalls. "Things have changed, the city has changed, and now, you've got a surfeit of talent queuing up to play there. You're spoilt for choice.\par \par \uc2 "Once upon a time, I was the only person who seemed to come over, so I had it my way!" Despite the bombs and the bullets, Ralph was a tireless promoter of Northern Ireland to his fellow musicians, often urging them to visit the province for live shows. "I'm not claiming heroic status here, but I tried to persuade everyone I knew that this was a great place to play, that the people were wonderful and that they'd have a great time," Ralph says.\par \par \uc2 "But if you've got a band of four people, it only needs one of them to not want to go, and I encountered that on many occasions. For some people, the fear was very, very real. All they saw was the terrible news reports." Ralph's love affair with Northern Ireland extends even further, as he encouraged his own daughter, Leah \u8212\'20\'14 one of his four children with Nanna, his wife of almost 50 years \u8212\'20\'14 to study there. "She was offered places at a university in Scotland and at Queen's. I said, 'I know where I would go,' and she said, 'But there's a lot of trouble ...' And I said, 'Leah, that's what everybody says, but it's not like that. Belfast is a vibrant and exciting place'.\par \par \uc2 "So, she went, and she had a wonderful time. She even got a great Belfast accent! The late Jim Aiken \u8212\'20\'14 who brought the Rolling Stones to Ireland and various other things \u8212\'20\'14 was a personal friend of mine, and I said to Leah, 'If you get any problems, you just go see Jim and he'll look after you!'." Surprisingly, neither his daughter or his sons \u8212\'20\'14 Sam (47), Tom (37) and Billy (36) \u8212\'20\'14 have followed their father into performing for a living. "Music is extremely important to them," Ralph says, "but they''ve probably seen the other side of what it can be like \u8212\'20\'14 the doubts, and the grief you give yourself. None of them have gone into it professionally, although I''m delighted to say that at least three of them play an instrument, and the one that doesn''t \u8212\'20\'14 my son Tom \u8212\'20\'14 is actually looking after my business and will be with me in Ireland. He''s tour-managing me and is taking care of our little company as well."\par \par \uc2 Ralph's Celtic connections go deeper still. A veteran of more than 50 album releases, his back catalogue is brimming with songs inspired by the Emerald Isle and its people, from the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  anthem From Clare to Here to Mr Connaughton, based upon a neighbourhood Irishman who helped spark a love of music in the young Ralph May, as he was then known.\par \par \uc2 "There was a massive wave of Irish \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to England after the war \u8212\'20\'14 from both north and south \u8212\'20\'14 and Mr Connaughton was a young man who lived upstairs from my family," Ralph explains. "I grew up without a dad, so people like Mr Connaughton, who gave us kids a little bit of time, were important.\par \par \uc2 "I always associated the Irish accent with warmth and kindness, possibly because of him, originally, and when I was in hospital after my accident \u8212\'20\'14 I had a bad motor accident and I was away for 16 weeks \u8212\'20\'14 I was looked after by an Irish nurse, and when I came out, my mother and my brother told me I had an Irish accent.\par \par \uc2 "Then if we cut to my teenage years, when I was in the Army, I was in with boys from the north and the south. In the Republic, you could join at 14-and-a-half, and in the north, you had to be 15. I was 15 when I joined up, and I met Irish lads from all over the place. So, it goes back a long way."\par \par \uc2 But it was in the folk clubs where Ralph's bond with Ireland was solidified. He was drawn to the traditional songs that were a fixture of the music scene in the late 1950s and '60s. "The bravado and the craic and the good humour and the fierce sense of enjoyment was very intoxicating, with or without alcohol," he reminisces.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not a gloomy person, but I think quite deeply at times, and there's a lovely counterpoint to all that to be in company where people love to be together and have a bit of music and tell a few yarns and take a few chances. It's who I would like to be more like, in many ways."\par \par \uc2 Ralph's own songs have likewise affected many people over the years, perhaps none more so than Streets of London. Written for his 1969 second album Spiral Staircase, the heartfelt tune with its poetic lyric about loneliness \u8212\'20\'14 not homelessness, as is often thought \u8212\'20\'14 was rerecorded as a single for the 1974 Christmas market, reaching number two in the UK and becoming a global hit.\par \par \uc2 Today, it remains a folk club staple and has been covered by hundreds of artists, ranging from Cliff Richard to punk outfit the Anti-Nowhere League. "We get another cover version nearly every week or month," Ralph marvels. "I just got a Serbo-Croat translation through the other day.\par \par \uc2 "I haven't the foggiest idea how or why it's happened, and if I thought it was my best song, I would have peaked extremely early, because I began writing it in about 1965.\par \par \uc2 Given that it has brought financial rewards but tended to overshadow the rest of his material, Ralph regards the success of the song as a double-edged sword. "I am enormously grateful to it in one sense, but slightly resentful in another that I can never move past it effectively in the overground," he considers. "But as I was never aiming for commercial success, I'm very grateful for this accidental blip in my graph."\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Streets of London has taken on a life of its own, reaching audiences far beyond the folk circuit. The song \u8212\'20\'14 and McTell \u8212\'20\'14 have been parodied numerous times over the years, notably a French and Saunders sketch in which Ralph appears alongside a host of rock luminaries, who are giving evidence against McTell in court, where he is accused of writing a useless guitar instruction book.\par \par \uc2 The cult sketch show Big Train also broadcast a skit in which actor Kevin Eldon portrays McTell as a singer whose audience \u8212\'20\'14 including future Hollywood star Simon Pegg \u8212\'20\'14 boo loudly when he tries to play anything other than Streets of London.\par \par \uc2 Ralph takes the mickey-taking in his stride, though, even if he's not exactly sure what's so funny. "With Big Train, I personally didn't think it was a great gag," he admits. "I just thought, 'Why are they all laughing?' It caught me off-guard, because, of course, my audience knows the other three or four hundred songs.\par \par \uc2 "With French and Saunders, Dawn [French] always comes to my gigs when I'm playing locally, so I think she must have put me up for it. But my manager at the time didn't tell me I was the guy in the dock. I thought I was going to go along with all the other musicians \u8212\'20\'14 Dave Gilmour, and Mark Knopfler, and Lemmy, and everyone.\par \par \uc2 "When I saw that I was the fall guy, I said, 'What the eff is this?' I nearly clocked my manager. For weeks afterwards, people would walk up to me and go, 'Guilty!' " Still, a bit of ribbing from the nation's comedians is a small price to pay for having written a song that seems destined to stand the test of time, long after Ralph himself is gone.\par \par \uc2 "It's beginning to dawn on me that it's going to last," he reflects. "It's an extraordinary thing. I spent at least half or three-quarters of my career denying it was that. But even if I think it's just another song, the world takes a slightly different view."\par \par \uc2 Ralph McTell plays the MAC in Belfast tomorrow.

Nevertheless he quipped that the song also meant "I don''t ever have to work again if I don''t want to." e Wonderwall (1995) by Oasis: of the breakthrough hit that helped launch their career, lead singer of the Mancunian Britpop icons Liam Gallagher (second from top) reportedly told MTV in 2008 that "I can''t f****** stand that f****** song! Every time I have to sing it I want to gag." e Stairway To Heaven (1971) by Led Zeppelin: the atmospheric classic has become a standard for any aspiring teen guitar player, but the band's lead singer Robert Plant told a newspaper in 1988: "I'"I'd break out in hives if I had to sing that song in every show." e I WIll Survive (1978) by Gloria Gaynor: although the American disco singer (below) enjoyed a raft of hits in the Seventies and Eighties, it was this defiant tribute to newfound singledom that will be her lasting legacy it seems e Born in the USA (1984) by Bruce Springsteen: written as a strident critique of America's treatment of its Vietnam War veterans, many took The Boss's bombastic delivery a little too literally in the midst of the economic optimism of Reagan's America.\par \par \uc2 In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, Springsteen (left) would only play the song live in a pared-down acoustic format, but has more recently returned it to its fist-pumping glory while touring\par \par \uc2 'My daughter went to Queen's and had a really wonderful time'\par \par \uc2 Document WBEL000020140507ea570003v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw160\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2400\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Britain has one of the most liberal takeover regimes in the world. Foreign businesses face few obstacles if they wish to invest in UK companies or buy them outright. Beyond the preservation of competition, decisions on deals are firmly reserved for shareholders.\par \par \uc2 This simple and robust regime has many virtues. It has arguably secured for Britain a greater share of foreign direct investment than its economic weight would allow.\par \par \uc2 Overseas capital and management knowhow have patiently turned round once-moribund sectors, such as the car industry. Jaguar Land Rover and Mini are now world-beating brands whose output adds to the UK's export balance. Had their foreign owners been subject to controls and approvals, some might never have made their way to Britain's shores.\par \par \uc2 Any liberal regime, of course, has exceptions. Few would dispute the UK's right to police acquisitions of companies involved in activities vital to national defence.\par \par \uc2 The question posed by \uc2 Pfizer\uc2 's hostile approach to \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2  is whether those criteria should be widened. Should the state enjoy the power to review deals involving companies that form part of the country's science base?\par \par \uc2 Britain has a big interest in the future of \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2 . The company is Britain's second-largest drugmaker. It employs nearly 7,000 scientists in the UK and supports a wider supply chain. \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2  is not only important to Britain's future as a leader in the pharmaceuticals industry. Losing such a chunk of infrastructure could imperil the country's strategic objective of remaining a high-tech manufacturing base.\par \par \uc2 The worry is that a deal could lead to just this outcome. To justify the premium it might have to pay, \uc2 Pfizer\uc2  would slash the combined company's costs - including research. \uc2 Pfizer\uc2  has not spared R&D in the past . Since acquiring large US rival Wyeth in 2009, it has cut its research budget from $11bn to $6.7bn. To believe it would act differently with \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2  seems simply naive.\par \par \uc2 The US bidder has acknowledged the legitimacy of Britain's interest. The company's boss, \uc2 Ian Read\uc2  , has written to the government to offer assurances about its commitment to the UK. These, however, are time-limited and without force.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the government has appointed two senior civil servants, including \uc2 Sir Jeremy Heywood\uc2 , cabinet secretary, to consider how to respond.\par \par \uc2 While this informal horsetrading may be the only way the government has of dealing with its concerns, it is unsatisfactory. First, it is excessively political, and Britain's experience of ministerial involvement in merger control has been very mixed. Second, the lack of legal force means any reassurance given is flimsy.\par \par \uc2 Research - whether into pharmaceuticals or other high-tech sectors - is a global activity and Britain should compete as an attractive location for investment. Primarily, this should mean pursuing excellence in education and enlightenment in \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy.\par \par \uc2 But the government should not allow facilities built up over many years - and often with the benefit of public support - to be neglected or stripped for financial or competitive advantage through the short-sightedness of shareholders. Once lost, these are very hard to restore.\par \par \uc2 This should not mean imposing a French-style industrial strategy of picking winners. The government should establish an independent body to assess bids from buyers, whether foreign or domestic, that might damage the UK's science base. This should have the power to seek structural remedies if necessary. In extremis it should be able to block deals outright.\par \par \uc2 These powers must be tightly defined and used sparingly. Protecting the science base is vital. But it should not mean dumping an open-door policy that has, on balance, served the country well.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140507ea570002k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Eurosceptics In the first part of a series on antiEU parties shaking up politics across the continent, Kiran Stacey and \uc2 Jim Pickard\uc2  look at Britain's Ukip\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage almost did not survive the last general election. The aeroplane crash that nearly killed the leader of the UK Independence party on polling day in 2010 has gone down in its folklore as the moment the man previously regarded as jovial, if not amateurish, got serious.\par \par \uc2 "That crash changed him," says Marta Andreasen, an MEP who quit the populist anti-EU party last year amid disagreements about strategy. "It made him ruthless."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage, the privately educated, pinstripe-wearing former commodities broker and son of a stockbroker, has carved out a niche as Britain's most unlikely anti-establishment politician. He has done an effective job of targeting disenchanted Conservative and Labour voters, worrying party leaders. Now he wants to capture the anti-elite sentiment being expressed by voters across Europe and channel it into a poll victory in European parliamentary elections in two weeks' time.\par \par \uc2 In the run-up to the elections, the Financial Times is examining Ukip and other populist parties that are altering the political landscape across the continent. They are the Tea Parties of Europe and, like their US equivalents, threaten to overturn the consensus that parties do well by fighting on the political centre ground. EU officials fear that antiEuropean parties could win as much as 30 per cent of the vote.\par \par \uc2 The worrying thing for politicians of those mainstream parties is that the nascent economic recovery in Europe does not seem to be eroding support for their populist rivals. The UK is a case in point. It is growing more quickly than most developed economies yet Ukip continues to rise; the grievances of its supporters seem too deeply ingrained to be dispelled by a few months of good economic news.\par \par \uc2 Despite his establishment credentials, Mr Farage has successfully tapped into a well of resentment felt by a large chunk of British voters at the elites who govern them, both in Westminster and Brussels. Often found propping up the bar dispensing his brand of "commonsense" wisdom, Mr Farage's blokeish fa\u231\'00\'E7ade masks a professional operator determined to shake up British politics.\par \par \uc2 Once regarded as a fringe party, Ukip is riding high in the polls, on course to win up to a third of UK votes in the European elections. Some pollsters predict it will top the ballot.\par \par \uc2 The party will then try to do something it has never achieved before: turn that strong midterm support into seats at the 2015 general election.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage's ambitions have been helped by two televised debates in which he attacked Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister and Liberal Democrat leader, for his stance on Britain's EU membership. The debates gave the Ukip leader a new air of respectability and boosted his party's poll ratings by 4-5 points, to about 13 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Winning May's election would be a huge moment for the party, which began as an enthusiastic, if donnish, group of political lecturers at the London School of Economics in the early 1990s. The group, led by Alan Sked, was united mainly by its opposition to the Maastricht treaty, the document that led to the creation of the euro.\par \par \uc2 For Prof Sked, the party has now changed beyond all recognition, having turned from an EU-focused campaign group into a political party focusing on issues such as \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and equal marriage.\par \par \uc2 "It has become corrupt, racist and obsessed with \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and Islam," says Prof Sked. "It hardly talks about the EU but its MEPs do travel to Brussels to get on the gravy train. I despise it now."\par \par \uc2 Ukip's increasing focus on issues that animate a wide section of conservative voters, such as race, religion and sexuality, has changed the face of the party and forced the political establishment to take it seriously.\par \par \uc2 So far, the coalitions of disenfranchised voters that have given Ukip some success in European elections have not translated into success at Westminster. At the 2004 European elections, the party won 16 per cent and came third, ahead of the Liberal Democrats, only to collapse at the 2015 general election to just 2.2 per cent. The pattern was repeated in 2009, when it beat Labour into second in European elections but plummeted a year later to 3.1 per cent in the national poll.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage is desperate for a different outcome this time, and has set about building a slicker, more professional party structure. He has targeted Tory strongholds in the south where, through by-elections, local elections and defections, Ukip has built a solid base of campaigners.\par \par \uc2 Figures published today by the British Elections Survey show over half of those who intend to vote for Ukip this month also say they will in 2015. That is double the number who said they would continue to support the party in 2009.\par \par \uc2 The strategy of building battalions of enthusiastic supporters in targeted areas is borrowed from Lord Ashdown, who used it as Lib Dem leader in the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 William Dartmouth, a Ukip MEP, says: "We are learning from the Lib Dems. They swarm. They go big on local issues, and when they fight elections they fill the constituency with hundreds of people."\par \par \uc2 Another sign Mr Farage is learning from mainstream leaders is his insistence on message discipline from the rest of his party. No longer is the Ukip leader willing to indulge offensive views from high-profile members, which in the past might have been brushed off as merely "politically incorrect". Godfrey Bloom, the MEP, was pushed out after a string of gaffes, including ridiculing foreign aid going to "Bongo Bongo land" and calling a room full of women "sluts".\par \par \uc2 Nor does Mr Farage tolerate the quirky policy ideas previously championed by the party. In January he publicly disowned the party's entire 2010 manifesto , which included ideas such as compulsory uniforms for taxi drivers and repainting trains in more "traditional" colours.\par \par \uc2 One person involved in drawing up the 2010 manifesto says: "There were dozens of people involved in writing that manifesto. The party was desperate to prove it wasn't stupid and had ideas on all sorts of issues. Now everything has to go through just a handful of people at the top and, ultimately, Nigel."\par \par \uc2 Ukip's leadership is also gearing up for a fight over a pamphlet being planned by some of the party's senior policy advisers, who want to set out some of their more radical ideas in a book called "Purple Vision".\par \par \uc2 These ideas are likely to include scrapping a range of taxes, including national insurance and VAT, and folding it all into a single tax rate, something advocated by libertarian think-tanks.\par \par \uc2 But those close to the party leader deride what they call "purple sky" thinking, which they fear will play into the hands of those who accuse Ukip of not properly costing policies. One Farage ally says: "No one is licensed to speak on policy except Nigel."\par \par \uc2 Another potential pitfall is that Ukip may have peaked too early. Having led the party into a position where it consistently outpolls the Lib Dems, Mr Farage faces pressure to win the European ballot and a seat in Westminster in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Mr Bloom says: "We have to win or the party is over. Ukip is finished if it doesn't come top." Mr Farage himself has promised to quit if the party fails to win any seats in 2015.\par \par \uc2 The most significant risk of Mr Farage's attempts to rebrand the party, however, is that it could undermine his and the party's antiestablishment credentials.\par \par \uc2 Joe Twyman, head of political research at YouGov, the pollsters, says: "The only thing that could seriously weaken Farage's appeal is if he starts to be seen as another member of the establishment."\par \par \uc2 The party is already struggling with some of the extra attention. In February the FT revealed that Ukip's MEPs failed to attend important meetings and votes in Brussels, triggering claims it is not defending British interests. Since then, the party's expenses have come under scrutiny. Having made political capital out of the expense row that engulfed Westminster in 2009, Ukip has been embarrassed by allegations it has misused Brussels allowances .\par \par \uc2 One particularly tense encounter came at the hands of \uc2 Nick Robinson\uc2 , the BBC's political editor, who grilled Mr Farage on the fact he employs his German wife as his personal assistant, for which she is paid up to \u163\'00\'A320,000 a year through the EU. The Ukip leader struggled to explain why she should take that job rather than a British worker.\par \par \uc2 Since then the party has sought to reassert its outsider status, attacking the private education of journalists at The Times, where allegations over the party's expenses were made, and rebranding itself the "people's army".\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage has found a way of breaking through to a section of voters the mainstream parties have not reached for years. Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin, political academics whose book Revolt on the Right analyses Ukip's support, call these voters the "left behind", saying they are largely poor and poorly educated white men who feel alienated from the pace of cultural change in Britain.\par \par \uc2 Ukip has done better at eating into Conservative support than any other party - 45 per cent of its supporters backed the Tories in 2010. But Mr Ford and Mr Goodwin point out that the same views are held in large parts of the urban north, where those who may once have voted Labour have not done so since Tony Blair rebranded the party.\par \par \uc2 Of the 15 seats Mr Ford and Mr Goodwin believe are most receptive to Ukip's message, 12 are held by Labour.\par \par \uc2 Rob Hayward, an expert in local elections, says: "It's always a misconception to believe they are all exTories. Many of them are non-voters or people who switch their allegiances."\par \par \uc2 Ukip is aware of its potential among disaffected Labour voters in the north: it launched its European campaign in Sheffield, a city built on steel manufacturing, with a series of posters focusing on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and jobs.\par \par \uc2 "The point is that euroscepticism is not confined to one particular side of the political debate," Mr Farage told the FT at that launch.\par \par \uc2 In the short term, Ukip's impact is being felt most keenly by the Conservatives, who are aware that even if the party does not win a seat in the general election, it could deprive the governing party of enough votes to prevent a Tory victory.\par \par \uc2 For that reason, all parties are carefully watching the reaction of the Tories to May's vote. If Ukip does as well as expected, and the Tories as badly, many expect the Conservatives to engage in one of their periodic bouts of infighting, as some pull to the right while others insist they must stay on the centre ground.\par \par \uc2 There are concerns, however, over Mr Farage's health and the effect the campaign will have on him. A committed smoker and enthusiastic beer drinker, he has told friends he is worried about making it through the election. "Nigel is convinced he is going to have a heart attack before the general election," says one person who has spent considerable time with the Ukip leader.\par \par \uc2 But having survived an air crash, Mr Farage has begun to acquire an aura of invincibility. And the robustness he showed in 2010 after picking himself out of that wreckage will need to be there in spades if he is to fight off the political onslaught he is likely to face in the next year.\par \par \uc2 Constituency\par \par \uc2 Farage agonises over his choice of seat\par \par \uc2 As the last general election approached, it became clear that Nigel Farage's latest attempt to win a Westminster seat was doomed, writes Kiran Stacey .\par \par \uc2 After dropping from about 16 per cent of the vote in European elections the year before to just over 3 per cent, his party struggled to make headway against a rising Conservative party and unexpectedly resilient Labour party.\par \par \uc2 But more damaging was the choice of where to run. Mr Farage thought it clever to pick Buckingham, the southeast English seat held by John Bercow, House of Commons speaker.\par \par \uc2 By tradition none of the main parties tries to unseat the speaker, so Mr Farage was given a clear run. But many voters in the small market town saw the move as a gimmick, and the UK Independence party leader came in a distant third behind an independent candidate, John Stevens.\par \par \uc2 This time round, the party is determined not to repeat the mistake, and has been agonising over where its leader should stand. Its dilemma highlights the various strands of the British electorate to which Ukip is trying to appeal.\par \par \uc2 Some in his party think he should take the first opportunity to run in a by-election where the former incumbent has been discredited, capitalising on Ukip's anti-politics appeal. They say Eastleigh, which was vacated after Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat, was jailed for persuading his wife to accept his speeding points, would have been a perfect choice.\par \par \uc2 Others say he should run in the north, where Ukip does not have a good ground operation but where many disenfranchised voters are receptive to his message. Great Grimsby, where the Labour MP Austin Mitchell is standing down in 2015, would be one option.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Farage's advisers are urging him not to make another tactical pick that could look like a gimmick. Instead, under their advice, Mr Farage is set to choose one of two coastal Kent seats, most likely South Thanet, where Laura Sandys, the pro-European Conservative MP, is standing down.\par \par \uc2 UK seats up for grabs\par \par \uc2 Great Grimsby (Lab); Plymouth, Moor View (Lab); Ashfield (Lab); Walsall North (Lab); Waveney (Con); Hartlepool (Lab); Bishop Auckland (Lab); Blackpool South (Lab); Stoke-on-Trent North (Lab); Great Yarmouth (Con); Eastleigh (LD); Rotherham (Lab); South Shields (Lab); Barnsley Central (Lab); Middlesbrough (Lab)\par \par \uc2 Analysis by Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin, based on demographics and two-party swing\par \par \uc2 Prof Alan Sked, Ukip cofounder\par \par \uc2 'It has become corrupt, racist and obsessed with \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and Islam.

\par\par \uc2 NATIONAL NEWS\par \b \uc2 Cameron sharpens tools to chip away at Farage support\b0\par\par\uc2 By George Parker, Political Editor   \par \uc2 671 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFTA\par \uc2 London Ed1\par 02\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  admits it will be tough to beat the UK Independence party in this month's European elections. "For Nigel Farage it's like a pub quiz and he's playing his joker on his specialist round," the prime minister tells colleagues. For Mr Cameron the real fight is a year away: the general election of May 7 2015.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron is braced for further upheaval in his party following Ukip's expected strong showing and for the likelihood some Tory MPs will press him to toughen his EU position.\par \par \uc2 But he has ruled out a tack to the right, believing he has the tools at his disposal to chisel away at Mr Farage's support. The tight Tory election team - Mr Cameron, \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 , chancellor, and Lynton Crosby, campaign chief - believes the party's commitments in areas such as \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and welfare cuts already rival Ukip's appeal. But Mr Cameron sees his most potent weapon in a general election as the warning that a vote for Mr Farage would let in Labour, ruling out an EU referendum in the next parliament.\par \par \uc2 In Downing Street, every policy and public utterance is parsed for its relevance to two straight political fights: the blue/purple skirmish with Ukip and the blue/red battle with Labour. "We're not worried too much about the Lib Dems," says one Tory official. "Sure we want to win some seats off them in the southwest and a few other places, but that isn't our main preoccupation."\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron wants to halve Mr Farage's support from its current 13-15 per cent but is equally concerned with Labour.\par \par \uc2 "We haven't even started pounding them on the economy yet," says another Tory strategist.\par \par \uc2 Much depends on whether Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne can make the general election a test of economic competence, or whether Mr Miliband can get voters to answer a different question: "Which party do you trust to improve your standard of living and make Britain fairer?"\par \par \uc2 In spite of the prospect of dismal election results this month, a sense of optimism pervades Downing Street. Some Tories are even speculating on Mr Cameron's post-2015 cabinet and whether Mr Osborne might move to the Foreign Office to oversee negotiations on the planned 2017 referendum.\par \par \uc2 "It's ludicrous," says one aide to the chancellor, "but at least it shows people are starting to talk about us winning." Those who know Mr Osborne say he is unlikely to give up the keys to the Treasury willingly.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron even claims to be happy about the expected return of Boris Johnson to Westminster at the 2015 election, although he would be unwise to say anything else. The prime minister will promise at the next election to serve a full second term in an attempt to head off speculation he might stand aside after the EU referendum. He tells colleagues he now has "a much clearer idea" of what he wants to do as prime minister and how to do it.\par \par \uc2 His team admits that the last election campaign was unfocused, with too many involved in running it. The next campaign will be tightly organised around a central principle: the "long-term economic plan".\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron plans to present a fresher Tory face to electors in 2015: a reshuffle expected in June is likely to see the promotion to the cabinet of rising stars such as Esther McVey, employment minister, and Liz Truss, schools minister . Veterans including \uc2 Ken Clarke\uc2  and Sir George Young are likely to make way.\par \par \uc2 But will Mr Cameron make it to the election if the Scots vote for independence in September's referendum? His team say there is no question of him resigning.\par \par \uc2 "His name's not on the ballot paper," says one. The prime minister clearly does not want to give Scots another reason for voting Yes in September.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the fringe, Page 9\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140507ea5700004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

The American label is home to a diverse range of artists from Emmylou Harris to the Kronos Quartet, from Brad Mehldau to Natalie Merchant. It kicked off on Saturday night with Devendra Banhart and Rokia Traor\u233\'00\'E9.\par \par \uc2 It was the first live show I\u8217\'20\'19d seen from Venezuelan-born, Houston Texas resident Banhart. With just him and his electric guitar, it was a bit like being invited into an awkward student\u8217\'20\'19s bedroom to hear some rambling thoughts and fragmentary songs. Wry songs such as Never Seen Such Good Things Go So Wrong and Won\u8217\'20\'19t You Come Over were delivered straight but vulnerably and got huge applause. But the Nonesuch PR must have squirmed through his admission that he couldn\u8217\'20\'19t remember anything about the label and his long wait at UK \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It was a relief when Malian songstress Rokia Traor\u233\'00\'E9 just launched into her music with a tight band. She\u8217\'20\'19s a small lady with a big guitar, and delivered a powerful, well-structured show from the slowly-building Dounia to the title song from her recent Beautiful Africa album.

He was also was driving around in a \u163\'00\'A360,000 \uc2 BMW\uc2  M3.\par \par \uc2 At the time, Jaber claimed he had spent the first eight years of his life in a refugee camp on the Palestinian West Bank.\par \par \uc2 He said his experiences in the camp were \u8216\'20\'18horrific\u8217\'20\'19 and he was so \u8216\'20\'18scarred\u8217\'20\'19 by what he saw he experimented with cannabis when he was 13 - five years after he arrived in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Jaber claimed his drug use increased to cocaine due to \u8216\'20\'18family issues\u8217\'20\'19 and intially claimed all the drugs found at the flat were for his own use.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, Jaber was warned he faced deportation yet in 2012 but he again claimed it would result in a \u8216\'20\'18breach of his human rights.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Whilst his appeal was in the pipeline, in 2013 he was convicted of money laundering and jailed for an extra 21 months after Preston Crown Court was told he used drugs money to buy an Audi Quattro S5 for \u163\'00\'A344,000.\par \par \uc2 Later that year he was ordered to pay back \u163\'00\'A337,147.06 as proceeds of crime. The appeal came to a tribunal in Bradford, West Yorks, on October last year an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  panel ordered he be deported saying removal would \u8216\'20\'18not be disproportionate.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The panel concluded his offending was \u8216\'20\'18simply too serious to outweigh his claims to remain in the United Kingdom because of his history.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The panel said his length of time in the UK was \u8216\'20\'18outweighed by the public interest in keeping society safe from a perennial offender who they believed in all likelihood would be a serious threat to individuals.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 But Jaber appealed to the Upper \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Tribunal in Manchester and used Human Rights laws to argue he would be at \u8216\'20\'18risk of harm\u8217\'20\'19 if he was returned to Palestine.\par \par \uc2 His lawyer Carla Rawlinson claimed Jaber's safety could be in jeopardy because his uncle had been killed by Israeli forces during militia insurgency in 1989.\par \par \uc2 She said Jaber would have to pass through an Israeli checkpoint and the checkpoints into Palestine are controlled by the Israeli occupying forces.\par \par \uc2 She claimed at best, he would be turned away by the Israelis and at worst he would be at risk of harm because of his \u8216\'20\'18history\u8217\'20\'19 and the history of his uncle.\par \par \uc2 'I am satisfied, given this appellant's appalling history, that the appeal fails'\par \par \uc2 Judge Richard Chalkley\par \par \uc2 She said the length of time Jaber had been away from Palestine in itself, would cause him to be at risk of enquiry by the Israeli authorities, who would want to know why he had been out of Palestine for 20 years.\par \par \uc2 But rejecting the appeal on April 3, Judge Richard Chalkley said: \u8216\'20\'18I am satisfied, given this appellant's appalling history, that the appeal fails. The appellant has not raised an asylum claim.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18He had not raised an Article 3 claim and given that he was represented throughout, if there was a serious possibility that on his return he would be at risk, then I have no doubt whatsoever that it would have been raised as an asylum claim or an Article 3 claim.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I find that there are no errs of law in this determination, which I uphold.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 HOW 200 OFFENDERS PREVENTED THEIR DEPORTATION BY CITING ARTICLE 8\par \par \uc2 Last year, 200 offenders \u8211\'20\'13 including rapists and muggers \u8211\'20\'13 successfully challenged their removal by citing Article 8 of Labour\u8217\'20\'19s Human Rights Act.\par \par \uc2 A Somali rapist, who held a knife to a pregnant woman\u8217\'20\'19s throat as he assaulted her, is among the many criminals who cannot be deported from Britain because of rules on a right to family life.\par \par \uc2 Mustafa Abdullahi (right), 31, was jailed for ten years in 2007 after he threatened to kill his \u8216\'20\'18vulnerable\u8217\'20\'19 victim and repeatedly raped her in her own home.\par \par \uc2 He was set to be deported on release and Home Office lawyers warned \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  judges of his dangerous nature and a continued lack of respect for the law.\par \par \uc2 But last December he was deemed to have a right to a family life under Article 8 and released. Abdullahi does not have any children or a wife in Britain, but his mother and siblings live here.\par \par \uc2 Separately, last August it was revealed Sanel Sahbaz, a foreign criminal jailed for various violent attacks, had successfully argued against deportation because it would violate his human rights.\par \par \uc2 Sahbaz, 30, a Bosnian who now lives in Hertford, came to Britain as a child in 1993. Since 2005 he has committed a string of offences including common assault, handling stolen goods, theft, public order offences and assaulting police.\par \par \uc2 He qualified for automatic deportation after he was jailed for four years, and the Home Office told him he would be sent home. But he was told he can stay indefinitely after he brought a legal challenge under Article 8.\par \par \uc2 His lawyers argued that if he was sent back to Bosnia it would separate him from his parents, brother and cousin, who are also in Britain, which would breach his rights.\par \par \uc2 Learco Chindamo was jailed indefinitely for knifing to death headmaster Philip Lawrence, a father of four, 18 years ago outside St George's Roman Catholic School in Maida Vale, west London, in 1995. The teacher went to help a 13-year-old pupil who was being assaulted.\par \par \uc2 The former gang member was ordered to serve at least 12 years, but released in July 2010 after claiming he was a reformed character.\par \par \uc2 The Government was prevented from deporting Chindamo to Italy, where he lived as a child, after his lawyers argued it would breach his human right to a family life.\par \par \uc2 He was freed and allowed to live in Britain, but returned to jail only months later for breaching the terms of his parole.

Like Ukip, both are leading in the polls ahead of the crunch May 22 \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  elections.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage has refused to join the alliance - and pledged never to work with the French nationalists because of their\u160\'00\'A0 'anti-Semitism and general prejudice'.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Farage has refused to rule out working with Mr Wilders - despite the Dutch politican\u8217\'20\'19s controversial views on Islam and \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 ,\par \par \uc2 Mr Wilders, who leads the Dutch Freedom Party, sparked controversy this year by joining in chants demanding 'fewer Moroccans' at a campaign rally.\par \par \uc2 But the Dutch politician dismissed criticism of his behaviour - and insisted he could persuage Mr Farage to work with Miss Le Pen\u8217\'20\'19s Front National.\par \par \uc2 He told The Telegraph : 'I am optimistic that Mr Farage will have more room to work together than he does today after the elections.\par \par \uc2 'He is not excluding my party and there is still an opportunity but he is tougher on the Front National for now.\par \par \uc2 'I understand he is a politician but I hope after elections both Miss Le Pen, Mr Farage and myself will be able to work together.\par \par \uc2 'I respect Mr Farage a lot. I think he is a very charismatic and excellent politician I understand he has a lot of support.\par \par \uc2 'But I also respect Marine Le Pen a lot. She is a very charismatic leader as well doing well in the polls with almost the same message when it comes to Europe.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Wilders said Mr Farage would join the far-right alliance after the elections - where Eurosceptic parties are expected to get a third of the vote across the Continent - because it would hand the anti-EU parties much more power.\par \par \uc2 He said: 'I hope we can overstep our differences to represent the all the millions of people who elected our parties to be as strong as possible a countervailing power against all the Europhiles in Brussels.\par \par \uc2 'It is not helpful to have two leaders of two important parties [Mr Farage and Miss Le Pen] fighting publicly. I hope I can play a role in bringing them both together. I would like to work together very closely with Ukip and Front National.'\par \par \uc2 Polls put the French Front National and Dutch Freedom Party in a strong position to form a far-Right bloc in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 . They are expected to end up with at least 38 MEPs from at least seven countries.\par \par \uc2 The Austrian Freedom Party, Belgian Vlaams Belang, Italian Lega Nord, Slovak National Party and Sweden Democrats have all vowed to join the alliance.\par \par \uc2 If the group does as well as the polls suggest, it would be entitled to over \u163\'00\'A32million a year in EU funds. But they would be in an even better position if Ukip's expected 25 MEPs were to sign up as well.\par \par \uc2 Mr Wilders said: 'The elections are historic because many Eurosceptic parties, in the UK, Netherlands and France, will have a very good result.\par \par \uc2 'If they are not the outright winners they will be second in many cases. That is historic.\par \par \uc2 'People are fed up. We want to decide who we invite into our country, how we spend our money for Dutch taxpayers, not to give it to Greece or Cyprus.\par \par \uc2 'We have to be masters again of our borders and budgets.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But Ukip has insisted that there will no alliance with Mr Wilders and Miss Le Pen.\par \par \uc2 Ukip's Roger Helmer said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  today: 'Memo to Gert Wilders: UKIP MEPs will absolutely not sit with Marine Le Pen's party. Ever.'\par \par \uc2 A party spokesman added: 'Ukip has made it clear that the party will have nothing to do with Front National or any of its fellow travellers in their new group.\par \par \uc2 'There have been no contacts between Nigel Farage and Geert Wilders.'\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140506ea56003uz\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Nosy neighbours told to look to the skies to spot guns, drugs and illegal \uc2 immigrants\uc2  being flown in via small airfields\b0\par\par\uc2 MATT CHORLEY, MAILONLINE POLITICAL EDITOR   \par \uc2 436 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par 11:58\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

\par\par \b \uc2 The Tories have a fatal weakness: they don't attract minority voters\b0\par\par\uc2 Andrew Gimson   \par \uc2 theguardian.com\par \uc2 742 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par \uc2 Guardian.co.uk\par \uc2 GRULTD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Guardian News & Media Limited. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Andrew Gimson: Cameron's party needs to reflect Britain's changing ethnicity \u8211\'20\'13 but fails to understand the patriotism of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \par \par \uc2 Policy Exchange has performed the useful service of providing, in a dispassionate report titled A Portrait of Modern Britain, an account of a potentially fatal problem facing the Conservative party. The report points out that black and minority ethnic (BME) people already make up 14% of the UK's population, and by 2051 can be expected to make up 20% to 30% of it.\par \par \uc2 Yet at the 2010 general election only 16% of BME voters supported the Conservatives, while 68% backed Labour. Already the Tories' weakness among such voters is making it far harder for the party to win an overall majority. If the weakness persists, that goal will become completely unattainable, and the party will find itself permanently excluded from power.\par \par \uc2 The word "modern" in the title of the report may be thought to hint at the solution to this problem. The Conservatives need, evidently, to modernise themselves. But their predicament is actually much more intractable than that.\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  won the Tory leadership in 2005, his position was analogous to that of an editor who has taken charge of an old and famous magazine with a declining circulation. There were going to have to be changes \u8211\'20\'13 any fool could see that. But the great danger of modernising a magazine is that you may lose your existing readers, who have a deep emotional attachment to the old way of doing things, faster than you gain new ones.\par \par \uc2 If you looks dispassionately (which I admit is a difficult thing to do) at what Cameron has done to the Conservative party, I think you have to admit that he has done quite a bit to modernise it, in the sense of making it more reflective of Britain in 2014, rather than of Britain in the 1950s. There are three times as many Tory women MPs as there were when Cameron took over, and the men of the 2010 Tory intake are also from a wider range of backgrounds and ethnicities than would once have been the case. The first member of that intake to reach the cabinet \u8211\'20\'13 the new culture secretary, Sajid Javid \u8211\'20\'13 is the son of a Muslim bus driver from Pakistan. Same-sex marriage has just been passed into law.\par \par \uc2 So although you can always complain that there has not been enough modernisation, it would be unfair to pretend that there has been none. Cameron's problem is that the changes he has already introduced have been greeted with deep repugnance by many on his own side. A new party, dedicated to the proposition that life was better in the 1950s, will almost certainly take a large number of votes from the Conservatives in the elections to be held on 22 May. Ukip draws its support from disappointed patriots, many of whom are also disappointed Tories.\par \par \uc2 What is Cameron to do? Like a reforming editor, he needs to convince people that his changes are designed to strengthen, not undermine, the inestimably valuable tradition of which he has the privilege to be the temporary custodian. His purpose is to make the country greater, not to wreck it. He is actuated by a generous patriotism.\par \par \uc2 And this can also be the way to appeal to people of \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  descent. Very many of them came to Britain, or their parents or grandparents came here, because they admire and value its tradition of liberty. They love the way one is left in peace to practice one's own religion and live one's own life: for whether or not we believe in God, we certainly believe in privacy.\par \par \uc2 Research published by Policy Exchange and others confirms that people of \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  descent are far more inclined to think of themselves as British. They are patriots: a point the Conservatives have not always understood, let alone been able to articulate. Our tradition is enlarged and strengthened by this infusion of energy and aspiration. There need, of course, to be strict limits on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 : most \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  will tell you that. But there needs also to be a much more convincing expression of the pride we can all feel in this country, whether we have only just arrived or have lived here for centuries.\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140506ea56000b8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Voices\par \b \uc2 Letters: We Ukip members don\u8217\'20\'19t deserve this \u8216\'20\'18racism\u8217\'20\'19 slur\b0\par\par\uc2 Independent Voices   \par \uc2 1,446 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par 19:24\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 These letters appear in the Wednesday 6th May edition of the Independent\par \par \uc2 We are Ukip members, candidates, spokespersons and representatives of the party\u8217\'20\'19s broad range of supporters from minority ethnic and religious backgrounds. We support Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s core values including its zero-tolerance approach to racism and discrimination, and, its commitment to withdrawal from the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 We are deeply concerned about what appears to be a concerted effort by the media to misrepresent Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s policy on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and to portray the party and its members as racist or xenophobic.\par \par \uc2 We have not faced discrimination within the party and we actively support the party\u8217\'20\'19s practice of taking disciplinary action against any member who behaves in a discriminatory manner. Ukip has dealt rapidly with the small number of cases where such behaviour has taken place and has sent out a strong message that it will not be tolerated.\par \par \uc2 Ukip believes that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  should be controlled by the \uc2 UK government\uc2  and not the EU. Migrants of all origins should have the right to apply to live and work in the UK and be entitled to equality of treatment secured by a points-based system without positive discrimination for those from EU member states. Ukip has never sought to abolish \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , encourage repatriation, apportion blame or attack migrants or their families.\par \par \uc2 Increasingly Ukip members are becoming subject to physical and verbal abuse. Members from minority backgrounds who have faced genuine racist abuse are now abused by our opponents. Many have also suffered the humiliation of being called \u8220\'20\'1CUncle Toms\u8221\'20\'1D or apologists for a racist party. This level of abuse is unacceptable in a modern democracy. We call on all those who wish to have a mature debate on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to cease perpetuating the falsehood that Ukip is \u8220\'20\'1Cracist\u8221\'20\'1D, its members \u8220\'20\'1Cxenophobic\u8221\'20\'1D. We demand opponents no longer engage in physical or verbal abuse and support Ukip in fighting to rid politics of racism, discrimination and sectarianism.\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Steven Woolfe, Economics Spokesman, Amjad Bashir, Small Business Spokesman, Winston McKenzie, Commonwealth Spokesman, Andrew Charalambous, Housing Spokesman, and 46 others\par \par \uc2 UK Independence Party\par \par \uc2 One can\u8217\'20\'19t help but smile at the predicament Nigel Farage and his party are in.\par \par \uc2 Ever since Nick Griffin won a seat in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  the whole establishment has gone out of its way to promote Ukip as a nicer alternative to the BNP, and how Nigel Farage revelled in his new-found popularity. He, or his party, were never off the BBC, from radio interviews to an unprecedented 12 invitations to Question Time.\par \par \uc2 His ratings soared, but the price paid is too much for the main three parties now that they too are losing votes to their Ukip project. The political establishment has now turned on him, branding his party racist.\par \par \uc2 They saw Ukip as a means to deal with the BNP but not as a threat to their own cosy positions. Can\u8217\'20\'19t have him taking votes off Labour, Conservative or the soon-to-be-forgotten Lib Dems! No, sir!\par \par \uc2 How pathetic but predictable.\par \par \uc2 Helen Carden, Stockport, Greater Manchester\par \par \uc2 Richard Grant (letter, 6 May) points out that the UK is the third biggest member of the EU, and if we were seen to be leading the EU everyone would be happy, so why don\u8217\'20\'19t we do it?\par \par \uc2 Indeed, as the third biggest member we have the third largest number of MEPs within the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , and qualified majority voting gives us equal weighting in the \uc2 Council of Ministers\uc2  with France, Germany and Italy, higher than all remaining member states.\par \par \uc2 But, given Ukip MEPs\u8217\'20\'19 poor attendance at the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , and their tendency to vote against everything the EU proposes on principle when they do attend, the more Ukip MEPs we elect, the less influence we will have.\par \par \uc2 This is presumably more of their not-so-cunning plan to build a case against our membership on the grounds of our supposed inability to resist the power of Brussels.\par \par \uc2 Francis Kirkham, Crediton, Devon\par \par \uc2 Economy recovers, but wages falter\par \par \uc2 Your economics correspondents have drawn attention to how low wages are fuelling a false recovery, where the economy seems to improve but living standards for most people do not.\par \par \uc2 Increasing use of zero-hours contracts and other tricks which lower the take-home income of ordinary workers means that labour becomes cheaper relative to capital, and there is therefore more incentive to use it as fully as possible. So of course unemployment figures fall, and the number of \u8220\'20\'1Creal\u8221\'20\'1D jobs (properly paid, rewarding skilled full-time work) falls too.\par \par \uc2 Using the tricks of the trade to lower wages also encourages lower productivity \u8211\'20\'13 because the incentive to invest in skills and technology is reduced. This may, of course, not apply in advanced technology manufacturing. But surely it must apply in most sectors of the economy: low wage levels and worsening working conditions are at least\u160\'00\'A0 one of the explanations\u160\'00\'A0 of the palsied levels\u160\'00\'A0 of productivity growth\u160\'00\'A0 in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Chris Farrands, Nottingham\par \par \uc2 Tories try to scare Scotland\par \par \uc2 Having worked on the preparation of UK national Budgets for much of my working life, I am irked when I hear the likes of Danny Alexander spouting figures condemning Scotland to financial disaster if it votes for independence.

Port patrol cars were on the quay alongside them within a few minutes."\par \par \uc2 Three of the men were plucked out of the water relatively easily, but one went missing and got into difficulty into deep water.\par \par \uc2 The body of an Eritrean who also tried to swim across the harbour drowned in exactly the same spot last October.\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of migrants from outside the EU are living in a camp yards from the perimeter fence of Calais port.\par \par \uc2 Charities say there are more than 650 in the town, the greatest number since the closure of the Red Cross camp at Sangatte in 2002 - and they are taking advantage of gaps in security and a minimal police presence.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140506ea56003bh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

Goodness Gracious Me: 'How could a show with more than 100 characters in it be peddling stereotypes?'\b0\par\par\uc2 Interviews by Laura Barnett   \par \uc2 744 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Meera Syal, writer and performer\par \par \uc2 In the mid-1990s, nobody knew what British-Asian comedy was. It had never been seen on TV. I'm not sure we really knew what it was ourselves. But there was a small live comedy scene, and we thought a TV sketch show could be something our community would watch. We had no idea if it could cross over into the mainstream.\par \par \uc2 I was a performer-writer on [BBC comedy show] The Real McCoy, where Anil Gupta was script editor. I was thrilled to be working on it, but it was an African-Caribbean TV show, very culturally specific. So Anil and I started chatting about doing something similar about British Asians. He got a team together and the BBC helped us to do a live stage show.\par \par \uc2 This went so well we were asked to do a pilot for Radio 4. They gave us the graveyard slot: 11pm on a summer Friday. We knew British Asians wouldn't be listening then. It would be middle England. And there was an amazing reaction - I think it really made the BBC sit up. We were offered a radio series, then a TV pilot, then a TV series. But it wasn't easy. It was a long, hard slog.\par \par \uc2 There were five of us at first: me, \uc2 Sanjeev Bhaskar\uc2 , Kulvinder Ghir, Nina Wadia and [the musician] Nitin Sawhney. Working together felt like coming home. We'd all grown up thinking, "Am I the only one who finds it funny that everyone covers their sofas in plastic, and has a drawer full of \uc2 Tupperware\uc2 ?" With these guys, I could just say, "\uc2 Tupperware\uc2 " and everyone would go, "Yeah!" I'd found my comedy tribe.\par \par \uc2 Sanjeev Bhaskar\uc2 , writer and performer\par \par \uc2 Goodness Gracious Me changed everything for me. I was doing a standup show with Nitin Sawhney called The Secret Asians. Anil Gupta and another writer from the BBC, the late Sharat Sardana, came to see a gig in a tiny studio in south London. They'd tossed a coin: heads, they'd come to our gig; tails, they'd go to the pub. Afterwards, they told us our act had exactly what they were after for a new sketch show.\par \par \uc2 I'd spent my 20s in marketing; suddenly I was 32 and working with this amazing group of proper actors. I'd seen Meera perform before, but this was the first time I'd worked with her. That, of course, would later turn out to be important personally as well as professionally. [The pair married in 2005.]\par \par \uc2 I was surprised by the degree to which the show was embraced by people outside the British-Asian community. A lot of the sketches were universal, I suppose - about families, greed, ambition, expectation, duty. My guru character was one of my favourites: he was a charlatan who answered any question about eastern culture with a reference to Star Wars or the Queen. I also remember a very funny version of Brief Encounter, set in an Indian railway station: the couple's long goodbye keeps getting interrupted by hawkers.\par \par \uc2 We did get some negative reactions from the British-Asian community, particularly from the older generation. One guy came up to me in the street and said: "Why are you washing our dirty linen in public?" I said: "Wouldn't you rather your dirty linen was washed?" Someone else told me the show was just peddling stereotypes. I pointed out that we had more than 100 characters: how can you have 100 stereotypes?\par \par \uc2 I understood where these concerns were coming from, though. As an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  culture, part of the unspoken message we were given was not to draw attention to ourselves. Goodness Gracious Me must have seemed as if it was mocking all that. But people seemed to come round when they realised that we weren't coming from a malicious place. We weren't denying who we were: we were targeting British behaviour and attitudes. We were all British Asians, with the "British" coming first.\par \par \uc2 Interviews by \uc2 Laura Barnett\uc2 . A special one-off episode of Goodness Gracious Me will be shown on BBC2 on 26 May.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 'I'd found my comedy tribe' . . .

And will vitamin drinks and dad naps be enough to keep them going? Laura Barnett hits the road with Kitten Pyramid\b0\par\par\uc2 Laura Barnett   \par \uc2 1,551 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A tin of chicken soup, a Kinder egg, a bag of salt and vinegar crisps, and a sponge. These are the items I'm given, in a carrier bag, when I arrive in Shrewsbury to set off on tour with Kitten Pyramid - Britain's latest, and probably most surreal, purveyors of prog rock. "Your welcome pack," says bass player Mark Hamon, who has a tufty yellow beard and a tattoo of an octopus on his right shin. "What's the sponge for?" I ask. Hamon's smile broadens. "You'll find out."\par \par \uc2 In the world of Kitten Pyramid, such a random collection of objects makes a kind of sense. Formed in Burton upon Trent in 2010 by songwriter Scott Milligan, the band is a loose five-piece, swelling to 14 for some gigs (when guitars, bass and drums are joined by trumpets and strings). Out this month, their first album is called Uh-Oh! and is pitched somewhere between Talking Heads at their most fractious and strange, and Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd.\par \par \uc2 Lyrically, Milligan's songs are both hilarious and bizarre. "I want to see you naked in a caravan," he reveals on Chester. Elsewhere, he sings the praises of "gorilla fajitas", "ladybird jumpers", and a "pyramid army with their bags of peshwari". Clearly, Milligan is bored by conventional pop. But much of Uh-Oh!'s freshness and richness springs from the fact that it's a concept album inspired by Milligan's late Uncle Jarek, a Polish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  who had schizophrenia.\par \par \uc2 To launch it, and to draw attention to the issues around mental health, Kitten Pyramid have put together their own idiosyncratic tour - of psychiatric hospitals, performing for patients and staff, with each daytime hospital session followed by an evening gig in a pub. Their aim is to raise money for, and awareness of, Arts for Health (AFH), an arm of the band's local \uc2 NHS\uc2  trust, South Staffordshire and Shropshire, which organises arts events for patients.\par \par \uc2 All of which explains why, still puzzled by my welcome pack, I am watching Kitten Pyramid perform in Redwoods hospital on the outskirts of Shrewsbury. The gig takes place in the bright, domed foyer, around a splendid grand piano, with a string of fairylights marking out a makeshift stage. The band kick off quietly, strumming through Red Shoes, a song that traces feelings of alienation in a supermarket. "You can't look down," Milligan sings, "because she'll think you're weird." The woman sitting beside me has a complaint. "I can't hear you!" she shouts. "Louder?" asks Milligan. "Yes!" the audience call back as one.\par \par \uc2 John, sitting next to me, tells me he recently lost his wife, Glenys, to early-onset Alzheimer's. They used to go to singing workshops run by AFH. "Even when she was hardly able to speak," says John, "she could still sing whole lines from her favourite songs. Music is incredibly powerful for people with dementia. It seems to stir up so many memories."\par \par \uc2 Certainly, something similar seems to be happening today. As the band play Whale, a track that requires the audience to shout the song's title at regular intervals, even the most distracted patients seem to sharpen their focus. An elderly woman with a cotton cloud of white hair taps out a steady rhythm on the footrest of her wheelchair. "It was wonderful," she tells me afterwards. "I used to be a ballet dancer. Listening to the music brought it all back."\par \par \uc2 Jessica Kent, the AFH manager behind the concert, thinks the band went down well. "Kitten Pyramid have a unique sound," she says. "It's like a musical patchwork, with something all ages seem able to relate to. It's so important to have events like this in psychiatric hospitals. The age of the asylum is over. New psychiatric hospitals are very different places."\par \par \uc2 As we all sit down to post-gig fish-finger sandwiches in a nearby pub, Milligan tells me the album's concept began with a bus. "Where I used to live," he says, "was opposite a bus-stop. I was sitting in my bedroom one day, looking out the window, when a bus arrived. I started thinking how weird it would be if I climbed into a bus with no driver, no passengers, and the bus took me to Burton, and there was nobody anywhere. Then I started to think that maybe this was the sort of thing my Uncle Jarek used to experience."\par \par \uc2 Milligan fleshed out his daydream until he had a detailed treatment for a film (his day job involves making lawyer training videos). In the meantime, he set about bringing together musicians to work on songs he'd composed over the last decade. He soon realised most of them touched, to some extent, on Jarek's condition. "One song, Fire, is about the time my uncle set fire to a brand-new mattress," he says. "Not all the songs are that specific, but a lot of them relate to what my uncle went through."\par \par \uc2 Kitten Pyramid were born. Milligan secured a bank loan to record an album and, in January 2013, the core five-piece - Milligan, Hamon, drummer Rob Redfern, guitarists Chris Baldwin and Dan Baker - went into the studio with producer Nick Brine, best known for his work with Oasis, the Stone Roses and Super Furry Animals. Uh-Oh! was the result.\par \par \uc2 The trouble with concept albums is that they can be a bit, well, conceptual: they can risk sacrificing musical coherence to high-art pretension. But Milligan's songs would still make an impact without any knowledge of the underpinning concept. "What sets this apart from other concept albums," says Baker, "is that we're not ponces."\par \par \uc2 Milligan is still planning to make his film. Each band member has been assigned a character: Milligan a psychiatric nurse, the luxuriantly bearded Baker a bear. There's talk of a musical. All this from a band that are unsigned. When I ask if they're looking for a major label, Milligan looks anxious. "This way," he says, "we have more freedom."\par \par \uc2 They are making no money from their tour: the hospital concerts are unpaid, and they're donating a pound to AFH from every CD sale. What's more, they've all had to take time off from their day jobs, which range from teaching to construction. There's no tour bus either: sustained by \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2  and elaborate in-jokes about dolphins, they're travelling in a Ford Focus and a \uc2 Volkswagen\uc2  Polo, although sometimes they get to pile into the "jaffa cake", Hamon's orange and brown VW campervan. Their stimulants of choice are "dad naps" (they range from 31 to 45, and they all have young children) and vitamin drinks spiked with Solpadeine.\par \par \uc2 It's all quite un-rock'n'roll - and rather refreshing and cheering, especially when it's clear how well the band's gigs go down, both in and out of psychiatric hospitals. After Redwoods, they hit an open-mic night in the Wrekin Inn in Telford, where the walls are lined with posters for the 1960s psychedelic band the Groundhogs (its founding member Tony McPhee's partner, Jo, runs the open mic). Kitten Pyramid blow the place away, with shouts of "Whale!" threatening to lift the roof. By the end of the set, two locals ("Juke Joint" John and "Dead Hand" Terry) have joined them on harmonica and kazoo.\par \par \uc2 The next day takes us to St George's in Stafford, where Milligan's uncle was once admitted. Kitten Pyramid are playing two concerts. The first is on a ward filled mainly with elderly patients. Between songs, an old man in a hospital gown shouts huskily: "Brilliant!" His name is Tony and he loves the blues. "Loved this, too," he says. "They blew my head."\par \par \uc2 Later, in a therapy room, the band perform shoeless and cross-legged beneath a board advertising classes: Monday is relaxation, Wednesday coping skills. I'm not sure which category Kitten Pyramid fall into, but their flight-of-fancy lyrics and helter-skelter guitarwork go down a storm. After the concert, one patient comes over. "Hopefully I'll get out quicker now," he says with a grin. "You've put me back on my feet."\par \par \uc2 It is this kind of reaction that makes all the hassles - the long drives, the dad naps, the Solpadeine cocktails - worthwhile. "That's what it's all for," Hamon says as we load the equipment back into the cars. With my somewhat surreal stint as roadie now at an end, I look again inside the bag they gave me. I never got the chance to eat the chicken soup - and I still have no idea what the sponge was for.\par \par \uc2 Uh-Oh! is out on 26 May. Kitten Pyramid play Newhall Social Club on 30 May and the Alsager Music Festival in Milton Park on 12 July.

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Labour majority\par \par \uc2 There are many psephological reasons why the Conservatives ought to lose in 2015 - but reasons, too, why Labour shouldn't be able to win. We guide you through the post-election scenarios, and take into account Scotland's vote on independence. While ahead in the voting intention polls, Ed Miliband's lead is said to be soft because he is consistently behind on the questions of leadership and economic stewardship, which are generally thought to settle elections. Labour's hopes rest on the apparent failure of the recovery to translate into rising living standards, the faith that the tide of history has turned against the free market right, and wear and tear blighting a five-year-old Cameron administration.\par \par \uc2 Scotland factor After a yes vote Labour would lose 40-odd Scottish MPs, a year into the parliament, so if Labour did win in 2015 its future would be immediately in doubt.\par \par \uc2 Labour/Lib Dem coalition\par \par \uc2 The polling and the electoral system point to this being relatively likely. Even if the Tories catch up with Labour on share of the poll, the electoral system could still hand Labour the edge. More opposition voters live in more electorally propitious places, and too many Conservatives turn out in safe seats; Labour seats also have fewer potential voters on average. All this makes it more likely that Labour will be pushed decisively over the winning line by a majority with a diminished Lib Dem party. Most Lib Dem activists would probably be keen. Clegg might be less comfortable, but the betting must be that he would not last long after the end of the Tory partnership. The relative stability of the Cameron years would probably incline Miliband to a partnership, rather than seek to go it alone. But would his party let him?\par \par \uc2 Labour minority\par \par \uc2 Deep tribal feelings, which can be traced to Ramsay MacDonald's move into the National Government in 1931, associate coalition with betrayal. Allergy to coalition is not a preserve of the Labour left, either - in 2010 \uc2 John Reid\uc2  and David Blunkett were early voices raised against trying to stitch together a Lib/Lab deal. If Labour comes out ahead in seats in 2015, some within its ranks will say that the very idea of coalition is discredited and urge the party to follow \uc2 Harold Wilson\uc2 's precedent in the face of a micro-majority in 1964 and a hung parliament of 1974, which is to govern alone for a short spell before going back to the electorate to try for a working majority.\par \par \uc2 Labour rainbow coalition\par \par \uc2 The idea of all anti-Conservative parties standing together in a progressive government was mooted after the last election. Plaid Cymru and the Northern Irish SDLP could be reasonable allies, but they are likely to be few in number. If the single Green MP, Caroline Lucas, were re-elected (which is uncertain) and even joined by a colleague or two, Labour would be nervous about how long a programme for government would endure with a party that has some protest movement instincts. By far the most important stripe in the rainbow (besides the Lib Dems, who some on the left no longer class as progressive) would be the Scottish National party. But its relations with Labour are poisonous.\par \par \uc2 Scotland factor After a yes vote all sorts of temporary arrangements could become possible. After a decisive no vote, a bruised SNP might not be in any mood to help Labour.\par \par \uc2 Conservative majority\par \par \uc2 No party of government completing a proper stretch in office has increased its share of the vote since 1955, when new prime minister Anthony Eden went to the country to seek a fresh mandate and romped home with nearly 50% of the poll. \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  could muster only 36% of the UK-wide ballot when up against \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 's fag-end administration in 2010. Next year he will almost certainly need to expand his appeal to secure an outright majority. Cameron's hopes of defying the record books rest on the economic recovery, and the reality that all politics is relative - so that even if voters do not "do gratitude" some may switch to him out of fear of an Ed Miliband administration.\par \par \uc2 Scotland factor If Cameron again came just short after a yes vote, the secession of Scottish MPs in (probably) 2016 could well lend him a majority, although whether he could survive in these circumstances is moot.\par \par \uc2 Conservative/Lib Dem coalition\par \par \uc2 Although the continuation of the status quo is always easy to countenance, there are substantial obstacles in the way of the Cameron/Clegg partnership continuing past 2015. Personal relations have been strained and Cameron's recent insistence that an in/out EU referendum would be a red line for negotiating any future coalition would make the haggling even harder: Clegg's deepest political commitment is to the European project. Nonetheless, with the right parliamentary arithmetic Cameron and Clegg might be tempted to go for it again - so long as their parties would let them.\par \par \uc2 Scotland factor The Lib Dems are disproportionately represented in Scotland. So if Scottish MPs were set to leave Westminster, the prospective usefulness of coalition would diminish to the Tories.\par \par \uc2 Conservative minority\par \par \uc2 Relations between the two coalition parties are even more strained than those between the men at the top. Tories blame the Lib Dems for a lack of red meat on tax and deregulation, while the Lib Dems have criticised Tory stances on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , human rights, and Europe. If, as the polls suggest, both parties win fewer seats than in 2010, neither would be enthusiastic about keeping a partner of sagging popularity in power. So in a parliament where the Conservatives are the biggest single party, a Tory minority government becomes the most likely option, even if its lack of a majority would still preclude the sort of policies that activists are keen to see.\par \par \uc2 Scotland factor: after a yes vote, governing in a minority would be more viable and attractive for a Conservative party that would anticipate the arithmetic shifting in its favour after the ejection of the Scottish MPs.\par \par \uc2 Conservative rainbow coalition\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage has claimed his party will hold the balance of power after the next election. This is unlikely. Ukip does not have a single MP, and Farage's own recent refusal to stand in the Newark byelection indicates a lack of confidence about exceeding strong second and third places chalked up elsewhere. Even if Ukip does get a few MPs it could only make up the numbers needed for a Tory majority with exactly the right arithmetic. An understanding with the unionists could be more plausible, but the Tories might be nervous about entering the thicket of unionist policies, and making themselves hostage to unionist demands.\par \par \uc2 Scotland factor Ukip fares badly\par \par \uc2 in Scotland, so the relative clout of\par \par \uc2 any Ukip MPs, as well the Ulster\par \par \uc2 unionists, would increase after a yes vote, making this very unlikely\par \par \uc2 scenario marginally more tenable.\par \par \uc2 Analysis by Tom Clark\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140506ea560000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Comment and Debate Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: Don't agree with Nigel: In a TV debate, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  should confront the Ukip leader, but acknowledge his appeal\b0\par\par\uc2 Melissa Kite   \par \uc2 665 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 As Nigel Farage delivers a killer line, with his customary blend of humour and pluckiness, the studio audience bursts into applause. \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  shifts uncomfortably at his podium. He opens his mouth and declares: "I agree with Nigel."\par \par \uc2 You can picture this scene only too easily. In order to win, or even survive, a TV general election debate with the insurgent Ukip leader, the prime minister may well decide that not attacking is the best form of defence. This is the big dilemma for Cameron as he prepares to square up to Farage in a series of party leader debates, now said to be likely after No 10 dropped its initial wariness and agreed in principle.\par \par \uc2 All eyes will of course be on the Dave v Nigel element. And key advisers are already split on whether the prime minister should opt for politeness or attack. The drawbacks of appearing shrill and rattled are obvious. But Tory strategists may yet decide there is an even bigger danger for Cameron if he opts for the "I agree with Nigel" strategy.\par \par \uc2 They need only remember what happened after \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  deployed the "I agree with Nick" line during the TV debates at the last election to see how this could go awry. The Lib Dem leader went from zero to hero, and then became deputy prime minister.\par \par \uc2 Those in the attack camp believe Cameron's best chance of dealing with Farage is to paint him as an extremist and stoke the fears of moderate Tories who have doubts about Ukip's credentials on race and equality.\par \par \uc2 I'm inclined to agree. I've spoken before of the sense of despair many grassroots Tories feel at being driven into the arms of Ukip. My parents, for example, feel they have no choice but to back a Ukip candidate in Warwickshire because they have been denied compensation for the catastrophic fall in value of their home thanks to HS2.\par \par \uc2 But they are not happy about it. If they vote Ukip, they will hold their noses as they do so. My father is that rare thing, a \uc2 Ken Clarke\uc2 -style pro-European. Every time there is a story about a Ukip candidate saying something idiotic, my parents get pretty depressed.\par \par \uc2 If Cameron were to come out fighting against Ukip, Conservative waverers might just listen. But it is no good him demolishing Farage without telling disaffected Tories why they should keep the faith with him instead.\par \par \uc2 The prime minister must put Farage on the spot while communicating to moderate Tories that he understands why they find him appealing. This sounds tricky. But it ought to be possible to disagree with the wilder excesses of Ukip's position on Europe, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and foreign policy, while agreeing that the party has a point when it criticises the long arm of Brussels and the pressure \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  puts on public services.\par \par \uc2 Labour had to do this when it faced a drift in its heartlands towards the BNP. No good would come of simply denouncing the tattooed skinheads. It was only when braver ministers such as Margaret Hodge acknowledged the reason for the BNP's appeal that the drifters started to return. What Hodge identified was that the rise in English nationalism in places such as Barking and Dagenham showed that her party had betrayed the white working class.\par \par \uc2 Cameron needs to demonstrate he understands that the rise of Ukip in the well-heeled Tory shires is because parts of Middle Britain feel woefully under-represented. Until he begins to acknowledge the reasons for their reluctant choice of Ukip, he cannot begin to earn himself a hearing with these people.\par \par \uc2 Maybe he doesn't have to say "I agree with Nigel." Maybe he could say "Nigel has a point, but . . ."\par \par \uc2 Melissa Kite is a contributing editor of the Spectator\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140506ea5600005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Frontpage\par \b \uc2 Despite appearances, it\u8217\'20\'19s Miliband, not Farage, who\u8217\'20\'19s breaking with tradition and upsetting the status quo\b0\par\par\uc2 Steve Richards   \par \uc2 1,071 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par 16:14\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 If voters want more of the same they must choose between Farage and Cameron\par \par \uc2 There is a striking disparity between the perception of two party leaders and the policies they espouse. Nigel Farage triumphs as the anti-establishment outsider, challenging orthodoxies and fuelling the anti-politics mood of which he is a beneficiary. Meanwhile, suffering poor personal ratings, Ed Miliband is viewed as part of the loathed Westminster establishment, a former minister who has spent most of his life in politics.\par \par \uc2 Such perceptions are easily formed. Farage has never been a minister. He has no record to defend. He is not an MP at Westminster. Miliband was briefly a TV producer on a political programme before becoming a special adviser at Westminster. He has worked at Westminster ever since.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, Andrew Marr\u8217\'20\'19s BBC show staged an illuminating sequence, one that showed how easily formed perceptions are misleading. There was an interview with Farage followed by one with Miliband. Finally, the two sat together and had a mini-debate. What became clear was how much Farage is a product of the Thatcherite 1980s, at least as much as David Cameron and George Osborne. Indeed I suspect if Margaret Thatcher were still active she would be a fan of Ukip, or at least urging Cameron to be more Ukip-like. Her voice is not required in that respect because Cameron is to some extent dancing to Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s tunes. He does so partly out of fear, but also because there is quite a lot on which he and Farage agree.\par \par \uc2 Both men are small-state economic liberals, except in relation to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Farage supports a so-called flat tax, one rate of tax on all earners. Osborne\u8217\'20\'19s first move as shadow Chancellor in 2005 was to declare his interest in a flat tax, a support that faded only when the likes of The Economist dismissed the idea as being too right-wing.\par \par \uc2 Farage wants a smaller state. The essence of Cameron and Osborne\u8217\'20\'19s economic policies has been to regard the state as the cause of the crash in 2008, in the form of too much public spending. They too seek a smaller, less active state. As Cameron declared at the beginning of his leadership, there IS such a thing as society but it is not the same as the state \u8211\'20\'13 an elegant reworking of Thatcherism.\par \par \uc2 Miliband and Farage were something of a novelty on Marr. What also became clear in the programme was the degree to which Miliband seeks a break with current orthodoxies. While Cameron, the 1980s free marketer, stands back as \uc2 Pfizer\uc2  proposes to take over \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2 , Miliband proposes intervention. This is not merely opportunism on his behalf. His belief that government can make positive interventions is the essential dividing line at the next election.\par \par \uc2 Since 1979, orthodoxy insists that the state is always stifling, that it wrecks markets. On the whole this remains the instinct of Farage, Cameron and some of the more extreme Blairites.\par \par \uc2 On the other side of this divide there is Miliband, Michael Heseltine, John Major (at least in relation to the energy market), Vince Cable, and more rounded Blairites like Alan Johnson, who in an interview yesterday, urged Miliband to propose a wider range of interventions.\par \par \uc2 Their advocacy of state intervention would be mainstream in most equivalent countries. As Miliband said on Sunday, there is no other government that would sit back and let a significant takeover happen without getting involved. In the UK, Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s arguments mark a big leap.\par \par \uc2 Of course, Farage seeks to leap out of Europe, and Cameron pledges an in/out referendum that could also lead to such a big jump, but these two positions are also a consequence of 1980s and 1990s-style politics, an assumption that the EU is to blame for virtually everything.\par \par \uc2 I have argued before that it is tempting to follow the personalities rather than the policy trail \u8211\'20\'13 good old Nigel with his pint and cigarette; emollient Dave. When Miliband tries to look like the outsider, addressing small groups with a loudspeaker in town centres, he looks silly. He reinforces a sense that he is an insider uncomfortable with a more challenging environment. When Farage does the same he seems the perfect fit, one of \u8220\'20\'1Cus\u8221\'20\'1D raging against the political consensus.\par \par \uc2 But follow the more important policy trail and Farage moves closer to the consensus. Harold Macmillan\u8217\'20\'19s policies were well to the left of Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s. In policy terms, if voters want more of the same they must choose between Farage and Cameron. Perhaps a majority of voters in England will opt for variations of that status quo.\par \par \uc2 But in policy terms there is only one candidate for significant change and it is not Farage.\par \par \uc2 Politics and \u8216\'20\'1824\u8217\'20\'19. It\u8217\'20\'19s all the same...\par \par \uc2 A new series of 24 starts this week, set in London rather than the US. Once again the hero, Jack Bauer, will face impossible dilemmas every hour. In an earlier series, Bauer had to decide whether to shoot his wife and save the world, or save his wife but destroy the world. I seem to remember he shot his wife.\par \par \uc2 The series is a huge global hit. The appeal of the much less popular art of politics is precisely the same as the attractions of 24. Both are about nerve-racking dilemmas that require near instant resolution. The attempts to reach resolution can trigger consequences that lead to greater dangers.\par \par \uc2 Early on when Tony Blair was Prime Minister I asked him what, in essence, his new job was like. He replied: \u8220\'20\'1CEach day I face decisions which can be summarised as, \u8216\'20\'18Do I cut my throat or slit my wrists?\u8217\'20\'19\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 There were no easy answers. Each decision brought further problems, and this was long before Blair had to decide what to do when it was clear President Bush wanted to invade Iraq \u8211\'20\'13 an unavoidable political nightmare for him whatever route he chose.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The report claims that numbers in the five largest distinct Black and Minority Ethnic groups could double by the middle of the century\par \par \uc2 The proportion of UK citizens from ethnic minority communities is set to double by 2050, according to a report by centre-right think-tank the Policy Exchange.\par \par \uc2 The report, entitled 'A Portrait of Modern Britain', claims that the numbers of people included in the five largest distinct Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) groups could double from the current 14 per cent, or 8 million people, to between 20 and 30 per cent by the middle of the century.\par \par \uc2 The study says that during the past decade the UK's white population has remained the same while the minority population has almost doubled.\par \par \uc2 The handbook draws on survey, census, academic and polling data to build up a detailed picture of the five largest minority groups in the UK - Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black African and Black Caribbean.\par \par \uc2 The think-tank, which has close links to the Conservative Party, says that 80 per cent of the UK's population growth is a result of growth in BME communities.\par \par \uc2 The majority of non-white Britons identify themselves as "British only", it said.\par \par \uc2 The report also argues that politicians should stop treating ethnic minorities as one homogeneous group and start appealing to the varied political views and concerns of non-white Britons.\par \par \uc2 It argues \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from the Caribbean, the Indian subcontinent and Africa since the Second World War has resulted in diverse groups with widely differing opinions, experiences and traditions.\par \par \uc2 It says politicians have failed to address these groups individually and says there are "clear and meaningful differences between each of these communities, which need to be fully understood" by policymakers.\par \par \uc2 Rishi Sunak, report co-author and head of Policy Exchange's BME Research Unit, said: "These communities will continue to become an ever more significant part of Britain, especially in future elections.\par \par \uc2 "However, as our research demonstrates ethnic minorities are not one homogeneous political group.\par \par \uc2 "From education to employment, housing to trust in the police, politicians from all parties must understand the different issues affecting individual communities."\par \par \uc2 The report suggests that voting intentions are broadly similar across the different groups.\par \par \uc2 Communities overwhelmingly identified with and voted for the Labour Party, with 68% having voted for Gordon Brown's party at the 2010 General Election. Just 16% said they would vote for the Conservatives and 14 per cent for the Liberal Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Last month Adam Afriyie, the first black Tory MP and once touted as a future party leader, said the Conservatives will not be able to completely detoxify its brand in the eyes of ethnic minority voters in time for next year's general election.\par \par \uc2 He admitted that even if Prime Minister David Cameron "does everything perfectly" in the run up to the 2015 General Election, the party's lack of support among minorities will persist.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Afriyie said the party would be making a mistake if it changed its policies to suit individual groups in a "political gamble" for more popularity.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140506ea56000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 A Palestinian career criminal who used the Human Rights Act to remain in Britain to deal in heroin and crack and lived a lavish lifestyle is finally facing deportation\par \par \uc2 A convicted Palestinian drug dealer is finally being thrown out of Britain after using the Human Rights Act to remain in the UK for an eight-year crime spree.\par \par \uc2 Career criminal Mahmoud Jaber, 31, had been peddling heroin and crack cocaine to fund a lavish lifestyle, serving three jail terms and racking up a string of convictions during his stay in Britain, a judge was told.\par \par \uc2 Despite being informed he would be deported as long ago as 2006, Jaber \u8211\'20\'13 whose father lives in the UK \u8211\'20\'13 used article eight of the Human Rights Act to appeal successfully against his removal, arguing he had the right to family life.\par \par \uc2 Since his appeal, Jaber has been convicted of a series of drug trafficking offences, complaining that he was \u8220\'20\'1Cemotionally scarred into taking drugs\u8221\'20\'1D because he was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank.\par \par \uc2 After a number of legal battles and appeals, an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  judge ruled that Jaber, of Accrington, Lancs, had an \u8220\'20\'1Cappalling history\u8221\'20\'1D and ordered that he be returned to his home country\par \par \uc2 It is thought that Jaber\u8217\'20\'19s case will have cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds in legal fees.\par \par \uc2 The saga began when Jaber arrived in Britain in 1988 for a six-month stay only to come back permanently in February 1992 to join his father in Accrington.\par \par \uc2 The parent - who had arrived earlier in the UK in 1987 - had already lost a battle to claim asylum in 1990 but he was granted leave to remain due to "exceptional circumstances."\par \par \uc2 Jaber was allowed indefinite leave to remain himself in 1998, in line with his father, and attempted to get British citizenship but in 2003 was convicted of a series of offences including resisting police and possessing Class A drugs.\par \par \uc2 The following year he was back in court for drugs offences and in September of that year he was jailed for four years for dealing crack cocaine and heroin.\par \par \uc2 In April 2006 Jaber was told he would be deported but in May the following year he lodged an appeal under article eight and won the right to stay.\par \par \uc2 In December 2008 he was repeatedly brought back into court where he was convicted of possessing cannabis, cocaine and breaching court orders.\par \par \uc2 Then in October, 2010, at Burnley Crown Court, Jaber was convicted of intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine and manufacturing crack and was jailed for six years.\par \par \uc2 The court heard Jaber had turned an empty flat into a drugs factory and police recovered heroin and crack cocaine worth almost \u163\'00\'A325,000. Detectives said his drug dealing had been on "a significant scale".\par \par \uc2 Police said that Jaber kept \u163\'00\'A34,000 in cash at his home and officers found a receipt for a \u163\'00\'A36,000 Breitling watch. He was also driving a \u163\'00\'A360,000 \uc2 BMW\uc2  M3.\par \par \uc2 In court, Jaber claimed he had spent the first eight years of his life in a refugee camp on the Palestinian West Bank.\par \par \uc2 He said his experiences in the camp were "horrific" and he was so "scarred" by what he saw he experimented with cannabis when he was 13, five years after he arrived in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Jaber claimed his drug use increased to cocaine due to "family issues" and initially claimed all the drugs found at the flat were for his own use.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, Jaber was warned he faced deportation but in 2012 he again appealed, claiming that his removal would result in a "breach of his human rights."\par \par \uc2 Last year, while his appeal was going through the courts, he was convicted of money laundering and jailed for an extra 21 months after Preston Crown Court was told he used drugs money to buy an Audi Quattro S5 for \u163\'00\'A344,000.\par \par \uc2 Later that year he was ordered to pay back \u163\'00\'A337,000 as the proceeds of crime.\par \par \uc2 The appeal against deportation was heard at an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  tribunal in Bradford, West Yorks, in October last year. The panel ordered he be thrown out, saying removal would "not be disproportionate."\par \par \uc2 It concluded that his offending was "simply too serious to outweigh his claims to remain in the United Kingdom because of his history".\par \par \uc2 The panel said his length of time in the UK was "outweighed by the public interest in keeping society safe from a perennial offender who they believed in all likelihood would be a serious threat to individuals."\par \par \uc2 Jaber then appealed to the Upper \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Tribunal in Manchester and again cited human rights laws to argue that he would be at "risk of harm" if he was returned to Palestine.\par \par \uc2 His lawyer Carla Rawlinson claimed Jaber's safety could be in jeopardy because his uncle had been killed by Israeli forces during militia insurgency in 1989.\par \par \uc2 She said Jaber would have to pass through an Israeli checkpoint and the checkpoints into Palestine are controlled by the Israeli occupying forces.\par \par \uc2 She said the length of time Jaber had been away from Palestine would cause him to be of interest to the Israeli authorities, who would want to know why he had been out of Palestine for 20 years.\par \par \uc2 Rejecting his appeal, Judge Richard Chalkley said the original panel had found that his offending was \u8220\'20\'1Csimply too serious\u8221\'20\'1D to outweigh his claims to stay in the country.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThose were findings which were open to the panel to make,\u8221\'20\'1D added the judge. "I am satisfied, given the appellant\u8217\'20\'19s appalling history, that the appeal fails. \u8220\'20\'1C\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140506ea560030g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FINANCE\par \b \uc2 Britain could become the world\u8217\'20\'19s fourth largest economy within decades\b0\par\par\uc2 By Roger Bootle   \par \uc2 1,080 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par 13:43\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 In 20 years' time, the chances are that the UK will still be a large economy and a major force in world affairs\par \par \uc2 Last week came news that, later this year, China is likely to overtake the US as the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest economy. There should not be any surprise in this \u8211\'20\'13 except that it is happening so quickly.\par \par \uc2 In fact, China will only pass the US on a particular measure of GDP that employs an artificial exchange rate called purchasing power parity (PPP). If you simply valued the two countries\u8217\'20\'19 GDPs at market exchange rates, the US would stay in front of China for many years to come.\par \par \uc2 That said, arcane though it is, in many ways the PPP measure gives a more meaningful picture. Although the Chinese authorities are coy about admitting it, in this respect, China really is on course soon to become the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest economy.\par \par \uc2 Arithmetically, this is the result of China recently growing faster than the US. And that is largely because of China being so far behind in development that it has greater scope for fast growth.\par \par \uc2 But the fact that such a country can be top dog is a reflection of China\u8217\'20\'19s population being more than four times the size of America\u8217\'20\'19s. For a very long time after China has overtaken the US, American people will still, on average, be incomparably richer than their Chinese counterparts.\par \par \uc2 There is another important size issue closer to home which involves some of the same considerations. You might find the conclusions somewhat surprising. For most of my life the UK has been slipping down the rankings of countries rated by size of GDP.\par \par \uc2 This does not mean that British people have been becoming worse off. Quite the opposite. But the rate of improvement has been slower than in many other countries. And the result is that the country has become less significant in economic terms.\par \par \uc2 Mind you, you can readily over-do the declinism. Many people do not realise that on the market exchange rate measure, the UK is still the world\u8217\'20\'19s seventh largest economy, larger than India and Russia. On the PPP measure it is eighth.\par \par \uc2 Until recently, the widespread view was that, although this ranking might be surprisingly high, it was bound to slip inexorably over the next couple of decades.\par \par \uc2 In fact, the opposite may be true. The UK is growing at about the fastest rate of any economy in the G7. Later this year the UK will probably overtake France and Brazil, and in PPP terms it could soon overtake Russia.\par \par \uc2 This would put it in fifth according to market exchange rates and sixth on a PPP basis. Now, there is an event in September which could radically change all this.\par \par \uc2 If Scotland votes for independence, the UK will immediately lose about 10pc of GDP and, accordingly, slip down the rankings quite a way. None of this would imply that people in the rest of the UK would be any worse off \u8211\'20\'13 at least not directly. Indeed, they may even be better off. But it would reduce the UK\u8217\'20\'19s weight in the world.\par \par \uc2 That aside, in the decades ahead the UK\u8217\'20\'19s ranking will be dominated, not just by matters of relative economic success, but also by demographics. Because of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and a relatively high birth rate, the UK population is set to expand materially.\par \par \uc2 Now before the serried ranks of \u8220\'20\'1CDisgusteds from Tunbridge Wells\u8221\'20\'1D inundate me with abuse, let me make it clear that I am not saying that this is necessarily good. But what I am saying is that, if it happens, it will have major consequences that we need to take cognisance of.\par \par \uc2 Other things equal, it would increase the size of the UK\u8217\'20\'19s GDP. Again this does not necessarily imply a rise in per capita income relative to what would have happened anyway. Income could be increased, decreased or just left the same.\par \par \uc2 But it does imply a larger economy. Many reputable judges believe that within a few decades the UK will have overtaken Germany as the country with the largest population in Europe. If we manage our affairs well and the UK\u8217\'20\'19s income per head at least stays level with Germany\u8217\'20\'19s, then this would imply that we would have the largest economy in Europe.\par \par \uc2 Where we would rank in the world, of course, would depend upon how other countries fared.\par \par \uc2 It is inconceivable that America and China would not occupy the top two slots, whichever was in pole position. And Japan would be bound to be number three.\par \par \uc2 But thereafter there would be a good deal of uncertainty. The current fourth slot is occupied by Germany. If the UK overtook Germany then it is not inconceivable that we would be in the number four position.\par \par \uc2 For that to be true, though, the UK would have to continue to outgrow the countries that are currently snapping at its heels, and that may be difficult \u8211\'20\'13 although not impossible.\par \par \uc2 The key message is that the UK is not set to plummet down the rankings. I fully expect that during my children\u8217\'20\'19s lifetime it will become the largest economy in Europe and remain in the world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest 10 economies.\par \par \uc2 This should have a major impact on various aspects of public policy. Take our role in Europe, for instance. Could we contemplate an independent future outside the \uc2 European Union\uc2 ? A small and declining nation would find this more difficult than a large and growing one that is Europe\u8217\'20\'19s largest economy.\par \par \uc2 Should the UK continue to have a major role in global affairs, including retaining its permanent seat on the \uc2 UN Security Council\uc2 ? And, linked to this, should the UK remain a major military power?\par \par \uc2 Our military planners and their political overseers seem to think that the next couple of decades are bound to be a continuation of the last couple, with persistent relative economic decline and therefore persistent decline in the affordability of, and the need for, strong defence forces.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes I think that the people who decide our defence strategy do not talk to the people who think about population trends. They need to. In 20 years' time, the chances are that the UK will still be a large economy and a major force in world affairs.\par \par \uc2 Roger Bootle\uc2  is managing director of Capital Economics\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140505ea55002jq\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Morning news headlines: Asthma patients 'dying needlessly' ; inquest for cyber-bullied girl, 14\b0\par\par\uc2 By liverpoolecho Administrator   \par \uc2 854 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par 12:16\par \uc2 birminghammail.co.uk\par \uc2 EVEMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Trinity Mirror   \par \par \uc2 The latest updates from around Britain and the world\par \par \uc2 ASTHMA PATIENTS \u8217\'20\'19DYING NEEDLESSLY\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Asthma patients are dying needlessly as a result of poor care, a damning new report has found.\par \par \uc2 Experts identified \u8220\'20\'1Cmajor avoidable factors\u8221\'20\'1D in two thirds of asthma deaths examined.\par \par \uc2 Patients are receiving inadequate information, education and advice on managing their asthma, according to the document.\par \par \uc2 STUART HALL FACES CHILD RAPE TRIAL\par \par \uc2 Veteran broadcaster Stuart Hall will go on trial today accused of raping two young girls.\par \par \uc2 Hall, 84, is charged with seven counts of rape against one complainant between 1976 and 1978 in Manchester.

Over the past decade, Britain's white population has been stable while the minority population has almost doubled.\par \par \uc2 The Policy Exchange handbook, A Portrait of Modern Britain, draws on an extensive set of survey, census, academic and polling data. It found that 50 per cent of minority communities live in just three cities: London, Manchester and Birmingham.\par \par \uc2 All minority groups had higher proportions of students staying on in formal education, especially university, than the white population.\par \par \uc2 But the study found that almost all minority groups, except the Indian community, have unemployment rates double the national average, while employment tends to be heavily focused in certain jobs.\par \par \uc2 It found that half of all Bangladeshi men work in restaurants and 24 per cent of Pakistani men are taxi drivers, while 43 per cent of Indians work in the highest skilled professions.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140506ea560015p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Britain retreats into splendid isolation\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s difficult to think of a time when politics in Britain has been so parochial and solipsistic. International affairs have all but dropped off the Westminster political agenda, Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s Ukip looks set to do nicely in next month\u8217\'20\'19s European elections and the public\u8217\'20\'19s biggest fear is \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 all symptoms of a gradual British retreat from the so-called \u8216\'20\'18world stage\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Despite the astonishing scale of the killing in Syria and the increasingly belligerent posturing of Vladimir Putin, turn on a television and you will largely hear gossip about the Royal Family or the latest Ukip racist scandal - and it\u8217\'20\'19s debatable which is the bigger soap opera. A group of intellectuals recently questioned whether Britain was still a Christian nation; a more pertinent question might be whether Britain is a post-internationalist nation \u8211\'20\'13 the political ambitions of \u8216\'20\'18Boris\u8217\'20\'19 seemingly more important than Assad\u8217\'20\'19s genocide or chauvinism in the Crimea. That, at least, is the impression you get from watching the news.\par \par \uc2 The reasons for this retreat into splendid isolation are actually quite straightforward. The noughties were defined by the so-called 9/11 wars, and our aversion to all things international is no doubt part of a more general backlash against the era of Blair and Bush. The economic crisis must also share some portion of the blame \u8211\'20\'13 today people are more concerned about how they are going to pay the bills than they are worried about bombed out Palestinians in Aleppo. \u8220\'20\'1CWe have our own problems to deal with,\u8221\'20\'1D we solipsistically say.\par \par \uc2 But there is another reason we are less inclined to \u8216\'20\'18do\u8217\'20\'19 international affairs, and this is that nobody is quite sure where they ought to stand anymore. On issues relating to foreign policy, distinctions of left and right have dissolved and become about as useless as a milk bucket under a bull. This is why supposed left-winger George Galloway has a television show on BNP leader Nick Griffin\u8217\'20\'19s favourite station; it\u8217\'20\'19s why \u8216\'20\'18neo-con\u8217\'20\'19 is no longer an insult throw around strictly by the left; and it\u8217\'20\'19s why Lord Tebbit's position on the situation in Ukraine is indistinguishable from that of the convenor of the Stop the War Coalition.\par \par \uc2 For an idea of just how confusing things have become, take a look at where the chips have fallen in light of the crisis in Crimea.\par \par \uc2 Not so long ago any serious conservative would have been the first to condemn Russian despotism. Today it is the shires and the City where one is most likely to hear someone singing the praises of the strongman in the Kremlin. Indeed, a short film produced by the Tory-dominated \uc2 Bruges Group\uc2  blames the Russian invasion of Ukraine not on Putin's well established desire to restore the Russian 'sphere of influence', but on the \u8220\'20\'1Cmeddling\u8221\'20\'1D of mild mannered EU technocrats. SNP leader Alex Salmond (and before you say it no, he's not left-wing, he's a nationalist) admires 'certain aspects' of Putin's leadership; and like the Tory MPs who cheered the news that British ships had been bombed by the Italian airforce in the service of Franco, Nigel Farage, the supposed champion of national sovereignty, has praised the Russian leader for \u8220\'20\'1Cplaying a blinder\u8221\'20\'1D in Syria (death toll 150,000 and counting). Putin, previously the gay-bashing leader of Europe\u8217\'20\'19s most unfree country, has for many conservatives morphed into the plucky defender of traditional values and Russian \u8216\'20\'18prestige\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Useful idiots can also be found on the left. A Guardian columnist recently said that the Russian annexation of Crimea was the \u8220\'20\'1Cfruit of western expansion\u8221\'20\'1D. It was, claimed the author, \u8220\'20\'1Ca product of the disastrous Versailles-style break-up of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Now that\u8217\'20\'19s certainly a point of view, it's just not a reality-based one. The Soviet Union is no more largely because its member states could no longer stomach being ruled dictatorially by elderly men in Moscow. \u8220\'20\'1CDisastrous\u8221\'20\'1D for the Kremlin maybe, but hardly for the principles of democracy and self-determination. It's difficult today to imagine the people of Lithuania and Latvia, two modern and democratic states, pining to be taken under the wing of the ex-KGB man in the Kremlin, hence why they joined NATO as soon as they could.\par \par \uc2 Clashes in eastern Ukraine\par \par \uc2 Others on the left have pointed to the West's 'hypocrisy' in condemning Putin's incursion into Ukraine. Because of the invasion of Iraq (or Kosovo) this logic holds that we in Britain have 'no moral authority' to condemn others for violations of international norms, however egregious.\par \par \uc2 The problem with this sort of thinking is that it wasn't 'the West' that invaded and occupied Iraq at all. As far as 'we' are concerned it was a specific 2001-2005 administration of Tony Blair that participated in the toppling of Saddam Hussein, and Blair left office seven long years ago. That's the beauty of democracy you see: you can throw out the leaders who behave badly. As a consequence the West of today is not the West of 10 years ago. That's demonstrably not the case with Russia, where Putin has effectively stolen from the Russian people their right to depose of him peacefully via the ballot box.\par \par \uc2 It isn't hard to work out why Putinism appeals to a certain type of conservative. The gay-baiting ally of 'traditional values' puffing himself up like a bullfrog on the world stage is probably invigorating when set against the vacillating no-content conservatism of David Cameron. What should worry any thinking person is how run-of-the-mill it has become right across the political spectrum to praise or excuse the KGB thug, homophobe and butcher of Chechnya Vladimir Putin. Just as during the Cold War, Russia is making respectable people say very silly things. But this time they\u8217\'20\'19re getting away with it.\par \par \uc2 Correction: The article originally claimed that Liam Halligan had worked as a strategist for RT (Russia Today). Mr Halligan has clarified that he has never worked as a strategist for RT\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140504ea54001bc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin: Ukip matters: It's not all plain sailing for the party everyone is tipping at the European elections, starting with how to broaden its appeal\par \par \uc2 Depending on your political persuasion, the next month in British politics will either be increasingly exciting or deeply depressing. The European and local elections will provide a snapshot of the fortunes of our political parties as well as Ukip's ability to fulfil its promise of "causing an earthquake".\par \par \uc2 The latest polls suggest that the party is on course to get the largest share of the vote in the European elections, becoming the first new party to triumph in a nationwide election since Labour's rise in the early 20th century. Such an outcome would represent a rejection of Britain's entire political establishment by a large section of the electorate, raising awkward questions for all the main parties.\par \par \uc2 The elections are crucial for Ukip as it seeks to establish itself as a real player in national politics. Here are the three most important questions about this revolt on the right that the elections on 22 May will help us answer.\par \par \uc2 Can Ukip broaden its base?\par \par \uc2 It is no coincidence that Ukip's election broadcast features lots of women, young people and minorities. These groups tend to shun the party. Nigel Farage is keenly aware of the problems this poses, which is why nine women appear in the party's top three spots on the regional lists from which MEPs are elected.\par \par \uc2 Since 2010, Ukip has relied heavily on a base of financially disadvantaged, old white men. There are lots of these left-behind voters, which is why Farage is hoping to "double down" on them in May, touring northern England and using billboards to target their intense concerns over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , Europe and "out-of-touch" elites.\par \par \uc2 But he also knows that to win Westminster constituencies he needs to reach beyond this core electorate. In 2009, Ukip managed to win a broader base of support by attracting middle-class, Eurosceptic Conservatives. However, such voters quickly lost interest in Ukip, which they saw as a tool for sending a Eurosceptic message to the Conservatives and not as a credible option at a general election.\par \par \uc2 This time, Ukip needs to retain the new supporters it attracts in its European parliament "home fixture". This is why we will be keeping a close eye on the local election results, to gauge whether the party's European voters also back them domestically. We will also be monitoring the state of the opinion polls in the summer to see if Ukip's European success is having an impact on its domestic chances.\par \par \uc2 Can Ukip identify local strongholds for 2015?\par \par \uc2 What began in the 1990s as a fringe rebellion by disgruntled Tories in the southern shires has quickly grown into the most significant challenge to the main parties for a generation. But Ukip remains hampered by the first-past-the-post system, which heavily penalises new parties with evenly spread support. To convert votes into seats, Ukip needs to build local strongholds where it can demonstrate a real ability to compete on the ground.\par \par \uc2 It is the local elections next month that offer real insight into Ukip's reach and prospects for 2015. This will be its last chance before the general election to demonstrate election-winning strength. Ukip will be looking for areas where it can top the poll and get councillors elected, because strong local results can be used as evidence that Ukip is credible locally. This is why many senior Ukippers are secretly more interested in these local battles than the European contest; they know they need another wave of local gains to have even a chance of causing an upset in 2015. For this reason, we will also be analysing the local polls: a cluster of Ukip councillors returning to town halls may well be a leading indicator of a strong Ukip challenge next May.\par \par \uc2 Can the party stand the pressure?\par \par \uc2 While Ukip is used to fending off attacks, the current wave of negative publicity is simply unprecedented in its history. Evidence of racism and allegations of expense fiddling are certainly not denting Farage's support, but they are piling on the pressure and fuelling his long-held frustration with Ukip's amateurism, as well as potentially putting off voters outside the party's core electorate who are more sensitive to concerns about extremism and incompetence.\par \par \uc2 Even more significant but ignored is the impact of all this on Ukip donors. While the likes of Paul Sykes are happy to contribute to an easier European campaign, will they be willing to back Ukip in 2015 should the party fail to get its house in order now? This is what the appointment of experienced journalist Patrick O'Flynn, a reorganisation of Ukip HQ, and tighter screening of candidates were supposed to achieve, but instead Farage has repeatedly been pushed into defensive mode. As the attacks intensify, can he steady the ship, reassure donors and finally address Ukip's achilles heel?\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140506ea5600001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

All other ethnic minority communities were more than four times more likely to associate themselves with being British.\par \par \uc2 Some 71 per cent of Bangladeshis and 63 per cent of Pakistanis considered themselves purely British. Fifty\u8211\'20\'13five per cent of the black Caribbean community see themselves as just British.\par \par \uc2 Rishi Sunak, co\u8211\'20\'13author of the report, said: "The face of Britain has changed and will keep changing over schools is from an ethnic minority the next 30 years. From the post\u8211\'20\'13war arrival of Jamaicans and Indians to the recent influx of Africans, the UK is now home to a melting pot of different cultures and traditions.\par \par \uc2 "These communities will continue to become an ever more significant part of Britain, especially in future elections."\par \par \uc2 The think\u8211\'20\'13tank says that currently voters from ethnic groups overwhelmingly identify with and vote for the Labour Party. Last month Adam Afriyie, the first black Tory MP and once touted as a future party leader, said the Conservatives will not be able to completely detoxify its brand in the eyes of ethnic minority voters in time for next year's general election.\par \par \uc2 He admitted that even if Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  "does everything perfectly" in the run up to the 2015 general election, the party's lack of support among minorities will persist.\par \par \uc2 SCOTTISH DAILY EXPRESS VOTE\par \par \uc2 Q Is a booming population good for Britain?\par \par \uc2 YES: 0901 792 5302\par \par \uc2 NO: 0901 792 5303\par \par \uc2 Yes text DXTUEYES to 86611\par \par \uc2 No text DXTUENO to 86611\par \par \uc2 Texts cost 35p plus standard charges.

But even this staggering figure fails to reveal the true scale of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , for those who apply for NI numbers are those who intend to work and pay tax, not those who don't.\par \par \uc2 This is one of the facts to emerge about EU migration from new data published by the \uc2 Department for Work and Pensions\uc2  showing where migrants have settled in the UK. The 1.2 million Poles have tended to settle in north London, Edinburgh and Birmingham. Lithuanians (256,000 all told) go to agricultural East Anglia, Romanians and Bulgarians make for the Welsh borders and Czechs favour Manchester.\par \par \uc2 Since 2002, 2.3 million migrants from former communist countries have moved here and last year saw more arrive here than at any time since 2008. Significantly these figures do not include the Romanians and Bulgarians who have come here since the beginning of the year when visa restrictions were dropped.\par \par \uc2 We are used to hearing about such large numbers of people but having a sense of where they are settling, swelling and changing the face of entire regions brings home the sense of an unstoppable movement that is beyond the control of government or local authorities.\par \par \uc2 And these, remember, are the migrants we know about, not the ones living in garden sheds or with criminal intent. Britain is losing its identity week by week.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140506ea560006v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

They highlight what a fiasco human rights laws are.\par \par \uc2 "It seems they protect the rights of rapists and murderers, rather than hard\u8211\'20\'13working British people."\par \par \uc2 Fellow Tory backbencher Jacob Rees\u8211\'20\'13Mogg added: "Foreign criminals who commit major crimes should be deported unless there are exceptional circumstances."\par \par \uc2 British law says foreigners jailed for 12 months or more can be deported when their sentences are up.\par \par \uc2 But many launch human rights challenges.\par \par \uc2 Home Office figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that 3,937 foreign criminals are at large in Britain after successfully appealing against deportation. Most committed relatively minor crimes. But a handful are terror suspects or gangsters.\par \par \uc2 And 98 have convictions for crimes such as child sex abuse, murder and rape.

Figures show the areas where more than 2.3 million Eastern European migrants have settled since 2002. Britain's 1.2 million Polish \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  live mainly in north London, Edinburgh and Birmingham, while Lithuanians head for East Anglia and Slovaks to northern cities. While the Welsh border attracts Romanians and Bulgarians, Manchester has become home to the UK's biggest Czech community. The Government figures yesterday prompted fury at years of EU migration. Ukip's Tim Aker said: "These astonishingly high numbers show how both Labour and the Conservatives have given away control of our borders.\par \par \uc2  "It's time we left the EU to retake control of our borders so we can have a properly managed \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system, as opposed to the free-for-all we have now." Department of Work and Pensions records show 229,000 National Insurance numbers were given to Eastern Europeans in 2013 - higher than any other year since 2008. The figures do not cover criminals, who do not intend to pay tax. The UK is a magnet for migrants because of its job opportunities and the soft-touch benefits system. Outside of London boroughs like Ealing, Brent and Haringey, 25,000 Poles live in Edinburgh, 19,000 in Birmingham and 16,000 have gathered in Luton.\par \par \uc2 The second largest group, at 256,000, Lithuanians can be found in the agricultural areas of Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire. Slovaks have congregated in Bradford, Sheffield and Derby, while Manchester now has 3,000 Czechs. Herefordshire is favoured by Romanians and Bulgarians. However, the figures do not include the huge influx from the two states since January, when visa restrictions on them were dropped.

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 If it's presented as \uc2 immigration\uc2  versus investment, Britain will vote to stay in the EU\b0\par\par\uc2 By Daniel Hannan   \par \uc2 860 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par 09:10\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 We\u8217\'20\'19re losing, we Get-Outers. Every opinion poll shows that opposition to EU membership has fallen over the past 12 months. Most now have a majority for staying in and, while one or two still have secessionists in front, all show the same trend.\par \par \uc2 The deeper you drill, the worse it gets. The most recent{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://uk.kantar.com/public-opinion/policy/pom-april-2014-membership-of-eu-uk-data/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 survey}}}\uc2  has ussouverainistes clinging on to a slight lead: 49 to 41 per cent. But the really significant finding concerns respondents' motives. The top reason to leave is \u8220\'20\'1Cstronger border controls\u8221\'20\'1D (56 per cent); the top reason to stay in is \u8220\'20\'1Cgood for trade\u8221\'20\'1D (63 per cent).\par \par \uc2 Which is precisely what you\u8217\'20\'19d expect, looking at how the debate is currently being conducted. A visitor from another planet, judging the parties wholly by their posters and election literature, would think that Ukip was a single-issue anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  party, and that the Tories were the broader Eurosceptic movement. The argument is dangerously close being framed as \u8220\'20\'1Cmore \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  versus more prosperity\u8221\'20\'1D. And that argument can have only one outcome.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19ve blogged {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100267401/a-calm-reasoned-case-for-brexit/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 before}}}\uc2  about the way in which, as support for Ukip rises, support for Brexit falls. Sunder Katwala {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/04/nigel-farage-hurting-eurosceptic-cause"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 calls it the Nigel Farage Paradox}}}\uc2 ; but, if you think about it, it\u8217\'20\'19s not so paradoxical. Ukip is doing what any political party in its position would do, namely trying to maximise its vote. It is doing so, quite sensibly, by targeting the people who share its values, not by addressing the undecided. \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is indeed the issue that energises its potential supporters; but it is leaving swing voters cold. Ukip leaflets are designed to galvanise, not to convince.\par \par \uc2 The In/Out referendum will be decided on economics. If one side talks about trade and investment while the other talks about Romanians and Bulgarians, the first side will win. And that, broadly, is what is happening now. The pro-EU campaign is trying very hard to imply (it knows it can\u8217\'20\'19t make such a false claim outright) that our trade with the EU depends upon our political association with it. The phrasing is deliberately vague: millions of jobs are said to be \u8220\'20\'1Clinked to our trade with the EU\u8221\'20\'1D \u8211\'20\'13 which the casual observer is intended to hear as \u8220\'20\'1Clinked to our membership of the EU\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 In fact, no one in Brussels has suggested that Brexit would prejudice our commercial relations with the EU. Now that Ukraine is signing a Partnership Agreement, the only state in Europe not to enjoy free movement of goods and services with the 28 members is Belarus. The idea that the United Kingdom, if it left, would not have the same trade access that, say, the Channel Islands have is preposterous.\par \par \uc2 It is true that Britain would no longer have its 8 per cent say over the framing of future legislation. But this supposed disadvantage becomes less relevant with every passing month as the EU\u8217\'20\'19s share of our exports falls. More important, it would be offset by two massive advantages. First, we wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t need to apply EU standards to the businesses that don\u8217\'20\'19t sell to the EU. This is especially important in such fields as financial services, where costly and sometimes downright envious Brussels regulations put London at a disadvantage vis--vis New York, Geneva, Hong Kong and Singapore. Second, we would be outside the EU\u8217\'20\'19s Common Commercial Policy, and so {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100250233/yes-to-free-trade-no-to-the-eu/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 able to sign our own bilateral free trade agreements with China, India and other growing economies}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19ll tell you the real paradox. It\u8217\'20\'19s that the economic arguments in favour of the EU are being made most loudly just as their rationale collapses. A study {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/insideradvantage.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 published today}}}\uc2  by Civitas blows the business case for EU membership to cinders and gledes. The share of our overall trade taken by the EU has fallen slightly over the 41 years of our membership. Our exports to non-EU states, such as Iceland Norway and Switzerland, have doubled while our exports to EU members have flatlined. The countries whose exports into the single market are growing fastest are all outside Europe. In fact, looked at empirically, there is no evidence that EU membership has made the slightest difference to our European commerce.\par \par \uc2 This is the case that needs to be made: the case for a global Britain, interested and involved in the affairs of every continent, including Europe; for an open Britain, which does not ask its citizens where their parents were born; for a modern Britain, which has outgrown a 1950s trade bloc; for an optimistic Britain, confident in its democratic institutions.\par \par \uc2 Heaven knows there is cause enough for optimism. We are now the fastest-growing major economy in the world. Depending on which measure we use, our economy has either just overtaken or is set to overtake France\u8217\'20\'19s and will overtake Brazil\u8217\'20\'19s later this year, making us the fifth largest economy on Earth. Do we really not think we can prosper as a maritime, commercial nation? Are we so diminished as a people?\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140505ea55003s5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

There's no N-word in the version of the playground rhyme that children use now. Jeremy Clarkson may not have been racist in his mutterings for Top Gear but he was certainly out of date. Some senior Conservatives fear their party is just as out of touch with the modern, ethnically diverse world.\par \par \uc2 A report published today by Policy Exchange, the centre-right thinktank, should make sobering reading for \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 . This Portrait of Modern Britain concludes that ethnic minorities will make up between 20 and 30 per cent of the UK population by 2051. While the number of white people has remained roughly the same over the past decade, the number of blacks and Asians has doubled.\par \par \uc2 Eight million people \u8212\'20\'14 14 per cent of the population \u8212\'20\'14 now belong to an ethnic minority. Although these groups make up only 5 per cent of those over 60, they represent 25 per cent of children under five. In the UK's largest cities ethnic minorities already represent 40 per cent of the population and in London, nonwhites outnumber whites at every age up to 20. Britain is changing fast and it is a trend that is only going to accelerate.\par \par \uc2 Despite all Ukip's sound and fury about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , for most people this is something to be celebrated rather than feared. Where I live in Hackney we benefit hugely from the mish-mash of Turkish corner shops, Indian takeaways, Vietnamese dumpling stores, French delis and micro-breweries making hipster beers.\par \par \uc2 This seems to be a general feeling among those who actually experience the melting pot. According to Policy Exchange, 90 per cent of both white and minority residents feel that their local area is a place where people from different backgrounds get on well together. Interestingly, ethnic minorities are three times more likely than whites to feel that "being British" forms some part of their identity. These communities are, for the most part, keen to integrate and aspire to succeed \u8212\'20\'14 all minority groups have higher proportions of students staying on in formal education at 16 and 18 than the white population.\par \par \uc2 For the Conservatives, though, the changing face of Britain poses a threat not only to their electoral success but to their very existence. The think-tank makes the point that ethnic minority communities \u8212\'20\'14 often treated, patronisingly, as a single political entity \u8212\'20\'14 are in fact several distinct groups with different priorities and expectations. Although 40 per cent of black people live in social housing, for example, 65 per cent of Indians and Pakistanis live in owned accommodation. There are also discrepancies in education, with 75 per cent of Indian pupils achieving five A-C grades at GCSE compared with 50 per cent of black Caribbean students and 62 per cent of Bangladeshis.\par \par \uc2 What unites all these groups, however, is a deep and enduring suspicion of the Tories. At the last general election, almost 70 per cent of ethnic minority voters backed Labour. Although 37 per cent of the white population voted Conservative, only 16 per cent of black or Asian people did. There is some evidence that opposition is softening among Indians \u8212\'20\'14 who are now four times more likely to identify with the Tories than black Africans \u8212\'20\'14 but still only 24 per cent of Indian voters ticked the Conservative box in 2010. Put bluntly, the single biggest predictor for not voting Tory is not being white.\par \par \uc2 This is the case, regardless of class, wealth or policy views. Although wealthier white voters are more likely to support the Conservatives, there is no similar gap between different socio-economic groups for non-white voters. Black and Asian voters, asked to place themselves on a spectrum for two issues \u8212\'20\'14 tax and spend, and liberal or authoritarian \u8212\'20\'14 all put themselves closer to the Tory position, but still described themselves as Labour.\par \par \uc2 With hazy memories of Enoch Powell's "rivers of blood" speech and Norman Tebbit's "cricket test" handed down the generations, ethnic minorities dislike the Conservatives because they are the Conservatives not because they disagree with particular policies. They are unlikely to give the party any credit for the recovery \u8212\'20\'14 according to Policy Exchange polling, these voters feel better off, and believe the economy is turning around \u8212\'20\'14 but all groups except Indians think that Labour would be better at running the country's finances.\par \par \uc2 "These are distinct communities but the common trait is they all hate Tories," according to one senior figure. "They don't think the Conservatives care about or understand them."\par \par \uc2 With just a year to go before the next general election, Mr Cameron faces a dilemma. In nearly half of the 80 Tory target seats, the black and Asian vote is larger than the Labour or Lib Dem majority that the Conservatives need to overturn. There is a huge electoral prize to be won if ethnic minority voters can be persuaded to trust the Tory party, but it will be hard to deal with decades of antagonism in just 12 months. Lynton Crosby, the Tories' director of strategy, wants a relentless focus on the economy and issues such as \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and welfare between now and polling day. For him, an ethnic minority outreach strategy would be a distraction. He cares only about victory in 2015. \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  is similarly focused on the immediate electoral test.\par \par \uc2 Other senior Conservatives, including Michael Gove, the education secretary, and Sajid Javid, the culture secretary, are more worried about the long-term survival of their party. For them there is more at stake than the result of next year's general election. If almost a third of the electorate will soon be made up of people who are instinctively hostile to the Tories, the Conservatives face annihilation, not just defeat.\par \par \uc2 The modernisers, including Mr Gove, have been speaking to Jason Kenney, the Canadian minister for citizenship, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and multiculturalism, who transformed the Conservative party's fortunes in his country by building bridges with ethnic minorities. Described as "the smiling Buddha", he argues that "new Canadians" are "the personification of Margaret Thatcher's aspirational class". Between 2004 and 2011 he increased his party's standing among these voters from 21 to 31 per cent. Next month he is coming to London to advise the Tories on how they can do the same. Mr Cameron should make the time to meet him and revive his campaign to eliminate the ethnicity effect in British politics.\par \par \uc2 The Conservative leader has a responsibility to think about the long-term future of his party, as well as its short-term fate at the general election \u8212\'20\'14 on which his own survival depends.\par \par \uc2 Voters feel better off but won't give Tories credit for the recovery\par \par \uc2 A problem for Cameron 16% 68% 14% 2% How ethnic minorities vote Labour Lib Dems Other Conservatives Indian 24% 13% 18% 6% 9% Pakistani Bangladeshi Black African Black Caribbean Conservative votes Source: Policy Exchange\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140506ea560009y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Small private airfields, helipads and even farmers' fields are being used by smugglers and people traffickers as a weak link in Britain's border security.\par \par \uc2 Microlights, helicopters and private business jets are being used to fly drugs, guns and explosives to remote or unstaffed airstrips where security is weaker or impracticable. Illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are also being transported in this way, police say.\par \par \uc2 There are more than 3,000 small landing sites in Britain, from private aerodromes and small flying clubs to old bomber bases and grass strips surrounded by farmland. There are 20,000 light aircraft and almost 47,000 licensed pilots.\par \par \uc2 Growing concern about the use of the landing sites by organised crime gangs has prompted an appeal for help from people living near private airfields by the National Crime Agency, UK Border Force and the \uc2 Association of Chief Police Officers\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 They want people to report the appearance of windsocks or lights at odd times, unusual activity around an aircraft once it lands, aircraft that are covered in mud, or packages being dropped from low-flying aircraft.\par \par \uc2 People who fly from or work at private airfields or flying clubs have been urged to report aircraft that have been modified to adapt their range or load or carry extra fuel, unexplained damage to aircraft, or pilots joining a club and flying to unusual destinations, especially long-distance foreign flights with only a brief stay.\par \par \uc2 Suspicion may also be aroused by pilots who are determined to fly in poor weather or low light, who land short of their notified destination, who disguise flight plans, or who are evasive about passengers or routes.\par \par \uc2 Police and security chiefs have also asked people to look out for activity that could be reconnaissance by criminals to test or research security around an airfield, or for visitors who buy uniforms, badges and other equipment.\par \par \uc2 All forms of private aviation are thought to be at risk of exploitation by smugglers, including gliding, parachuting and aerial surveys.\par \par \uc2 David Armond, director of the National Crime Agency's border policing command, said: "This is an area where we are convinced the public can really help law enforcement disrupt criminal activity. You might have seen unfamiliar people in sensitive areas of the airport, or unusual patterns of activity such as night-time airdrops. That information could be key to an investigation."\par \par \uc2 The agency asked people who saw suspicious activity to note the date and time and details of the aircraft, such as a description of markings and modifications, and of the pilot or crew.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140506ea560000s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw125\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1875\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH Established 1855\par \par \uc2 On the face of it, new research by the Policy Exchange think tank into modern Britain suggests that our country is changing at a staggering rate. By 2050, it says, one in three people in England and Wales will come from an ethnic minority, a demographic change driven by higher birth rates as well as \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Furthermore, the report also suggests that, among the five largest minority groups, only 20 per cent of those surveyed identified themselves as English, compared with more than 60 per cent of white people. Among many, those figures will understandably prompt a concern that our sense of national solidarity is being eroded.\par \par \uc2 There is, however, a more positive story contained in the figures. Because while ethnic minority citizens may not call themselves English, on the whole, a good majority describe themselves as British. Among British Indians and Pakistanis, more than 60 per cent consider themselves British; among Bangladeshis, that figure is 74 per cent. The numbers are lower among black Africans and Caribbeans, but none the less, the picture is a heartening one. Britain has taken these citizens (or rather, in most cases, their parents or grandparents) in, and made them its own; and they, in turn, make Britain theirs.\par \par \uc2 It is a reminder of what a unifying concept Britain is. It includes separate nations in a single state, allowing each their own identity while binding them into a larger whole; it has accepted, over its long and varied history, invaders and refugees and \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , and been changed by all, while remaining fundamentally the same. Its constancy in the face of change, like its unity from divided parts, ought to be a contradiction, and yet it is not.\par \par \uc2 There is much to be proud of in this idea; yet it is under attack on two fronts. One is to the north: \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  and his Yes campaign will try to tear the Union apart later this year, when the referendum on Scottish independence takes place. For all his soothing noises about how nothing will really change, Britain, as we know it, may no longer exist.\par \par \uc2 The second is to the south, where Nigel Farage and Ukip are leading the polls for the approaching European elections. While it is true that uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  carries risks, the tone of Ukip's campaign is entirely at odds with the inclusive picture of Britain that the Policy Exchange research paints.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, Mr Salmond and Mr Farage do not represent the country as a whole. As today's report shows, Britain is a nation that so many of its newest citizens are proud to call their own.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140506ea5600064\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par
