\par\par \b \uc2 Nigel Farage: 'Ukip is the patriotic party'; In an interview with The Telegraph on the eve of Ukip's spring conference in Torquay, Nigel Farage explains why he thinks his party has changed the agenda on Europe and \uc2 immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By Christopher Hope   \par \uc2 689 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 10:34\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The UK Independence Party's 20 year political journey will culminate at May's elections in "the biggest political shock in modern British history", Nigel Farage says.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader said that the European and local elections in May were "the moment we have been waiting for" which he hoped would create an unstoppable momentum to carry the party through to next year's general election.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with The Telegraph on the eve of Ukip's spring conference in Torquay on Friday, he said: "We are on the verge of perhaps causing in three months time the biggest political shock that has been seen in modern British history."\par \par \uc2 He added: "These are the stakes. This is how high it is. We will use these elections to tell the British political class where to go. I am going to tell them don't get mad, get even. Vote Ukip and let's cause an earthquake in British politics on May 22nd.\par \par \uc2 "This is the moment we in Ukip have been waiting for. We have spent 20 years, often very chequered ears on a huge big dipper. And this is, this is it."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said he would be wrapping Ukip "unashamedly" in the union flag at the party's spring conference today in Torquay.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to The Telegraph at a motorway service station on his way to the conference, he said: "We are unashamedly the patriotic party. There is nothing to be ashamed of.\par \par \uc2 "We have made EU scepticism respectable, we have made debating \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  respectable and lets make being proud of who we are as a country once again respectable.\par \par \uc2 "This is the moment Ukip has waited for. There would not even be a debate on a referendum or anything we have done in the past three and a half years, but we if we get this right we can create a momentum that is unstoppable going in 2015."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10660219/Why-do-you-support-Ukip-Party-supporters-reveal-their-views.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  Why do you supprt ukip? Party supporters reveal their views }}}\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said that Ukip "has a chance of coming" first in the European elections, pushing Labour into second place.\par \par \uc2 Ukip will fight 2,500 out of the 4,200 council seats being contested in May - an increase on the 1,700 the party fought last year.\par \par \uc2 The party would make \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  the dominant issue of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 He said that the Office of Budget Responsibility's forecast that an increase in Britain's population to 88million by 2070 would lead a one per cent increase in Britain's gross domestic product "you can keep that".\par \par \uc2 He said: "Even if huge mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and a population that spirals upwards of 80million means that we are all marginally better off I don't want it. There are some things that are more important than money.\par \par \uc2 "It would be marginal anyway but the point I am making is that life is about more than GDP statistics. It is about society, community, it is about our country, it is about how we want to live."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage also moved to paint Ukip as the working class party.\par \par \uc2 He said: "Every party has its pockets of strong support. The biggest level support we have in this country is ordinary decent people.\par \par \uc2 "In a sense the sort of people who used to voted for Thatcher in 1979. In class terms we have become the working class party."\par \par \uc2 Last week Mr Farage accepted an invitation to debate whether Britain should remain inside the \uc2 European Union\uc2  with Nick Clegg, the deputy Prime Minister. Mr Farage said talks were advanced, and the televised debate would be in early April.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said he would step up his campaign for Ukip to be allowed more peers in the House of Lords after the May elections. The party currently has just three, despite winning 23 per cent of the vote at last May's local elections.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140228ea2s003bk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Home\par \b \uc2 Patricia Hewitt apologises and admits links between NCCL and Paedophile Information Exchange were 'naive and wrong'\b0\par\par\uc2 Staff/Agency   \par \uc2 602 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 11:11\par \uc2 London Evening Standard Online\par \uc2 NSONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited.   \par \par \uc2 Former cabinet minister Patricia Hewitt has broken apologised for links between the \uc2 National Council for Civil Liberties\uc2  and a paedophile group, admitting it was "naive and wrong".\par \par \uc2 The Labour ex-secretary of state for health took responsibility for the NCCL's links to the Paedophile Information Exchange in the 1970s.\par \par \uc2 Ms Hewitt was general secretary of the NCCL at the time, and admitted tonight: "I got it wrong on PIE and I apologise for having done so."\par \par \uc2 Ms Hewitt, who said she had been away for the past 12 days while the controversy was raging in the the press, said any suggestion that she had condoned or supported the "vile crimes" of child abusers was completely untrue.\par \par \uc2 However she acknowledged that she should have done more to protect the integrity of the NCCL from the activities of PIE, which was allowed to join the organisation as an affiliate member.\par \par \uc2 Related stories\par \par \uc2 "NCCL in the 1970s, along with many others, was naive and wrong to accept PIE's claim to be a 'campaigning and counselling organisation' that 'does not promote unlawful acts'," she said.\par \par \uc2 "As general secretary then, I take responsibility for the mistakes we made. I got it wrong on PIE and I apologise for having done so.\par \par \uc2 "I should have urged the executive committee to take stronger measures to protect NCCL's integrity from the activities of PIE members and sympathisers and I deeply regret not having done so."\par \par \uc2 In particular she said that PIE member Tom O'Carroll should never have been allowed to join the NCCL's gay rights sub-committee.\par \par \uc2 Ms Hewitt said that a proposal by the NCCL to reduce the age of consent had not been hers, although she acknowledged that it had been the policy of the organisation and the executive committee.\par \par \uc2 "I do not support reducing the age of consent or legalising incest," she said. "As the NCCL archives demonstrate, I consistently distinguished between consenting relationships between homosexual men, on the one hand, and the abuse of children on the other."\par \par \uc2 She defended the roles played by Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and her husband Jack Dromey - who is also a Labour frontbencher - who were both prominent figures in the NCCL\par \par \uc2 "When Jack Dromey, as NCCL chairman in 1976, vigorously opposed PIE at the NCCL AGM, he did so with the full support of the executive committee and myself as general secretary," she said.\par \par \uc2 "Harriet did not join the NCCL staff until 1978. She was one of two legal officers, neither of whom was a member of the executive committee."\par \par \uc2 Ms Hewitt said that there were still lessons to be learned about the need to protect children from sexual abuse but said that she was proud of the achievements of the NCCL during her time as general secretary.\par \par \uc2 "NCCL in the 1970s played a leading role in anti-discrimination and equality campaigns. We helped to secure the Sex Discrimination Act, anonymity for rape victims and an end to discriminatory \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rules against British women with a foreign husband. We also built support for equalising the age of consent for homosexual men - a change eventually made in 1998," she said.\par \par \uc2 "Although the evil of child sexual abuse is now properly recognised, as a society we still have a long way to go in protecting children, tackling the sexualisation of girls and supporting the survivors of sexual abuse. I hope the lessons that are being learnt from the mistakes of the 1970s will contribute to those goals."\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140228ea2s002xl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Life & Style\par \b \uc2 Evan Davis: 'The talent all comes to London. It\u8217\'20\'19s extraordinary how sucking London is'; Fast-paced, crammed and luring in the cleverest folk, London is like a brilliant party, says Evan Davis. Who would have it any other way, he asks Lucy Tobin\b0\par\par\uc2 1,483 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 11:31\par \uc2 London Evening Standard Online\par \uc2 NSONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited.   \par \par \uc2 Move over, \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 . There\u8217\'20\'19s a new blood-sucking vampire squid in town. And its name is London.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLondon sucks," declares Evan Davis, the avuncular pierced one on the Today programme, whose new two-part series, Mind the Gap: London vs the Rest, tackles the capital\u8217\'20\'19s dominance in Britain. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a force sucking the talent out of the rest of the country. It flourishes on the back of the talent it sucks in."\par \par \uc2 To be clear, the 51-year-old economist turned Dragons\u8217\'20\'19 Den presenter doesn\u8217\'20\'19t think London sucks according to the teen\u8217\'20\'19s definition: he loves the place, from the Brompton Cemetery where he walks his new whippet puppy, Mr Whippy, to the South Bank, his favourite place to take tourists. But Davis isn\u8217\'20\'19t sure whether the rest of the UK can cope with London\u8217\'20\'19s dominance. \u8220\'20\'1CBritain is changing \u8212\'20\'14 becoming one country with two economies. There\u8217\'20\'19s London. And then there\u8217\'20\'19s the rest.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COf my 15 closest friends from \uc2 Oxford University\uc2 , one is in Brighton, one in Berlin, one I don\u8217\'20\'19t know and the other 12 are all in London," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CThere isn\u8217\'20\'19t a single one in Scotland, or Wales, or in Manchester or Birmingham. The talent all comes to London. It\u8217\'20\'19s extraordinary how sucking London is."\par \par \uc2 Davis himself is one of the \u8220\'20\'1Csucked" \u8212\'20\'14 after he was born in Malvern, Worcestershire, to South African parents, the family moved to Surrey (\u8220\'20\'1CMy parents were sucked in first"), his first job after Oxford was in London, \u8220\'20\'1Cand there was never really any doubt about my staying here".\par \par \uc2 That story, times a few million other London \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , is Davis\u8217\'20\'19s explanation for the capital\u8217\'20\'19s success. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s like nightclubs," explains probably the only one of Today\u8217\'20\'19s rumbustious presenters to use clubbing as an economic analogy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat appeals to a punter about a club is not the d\u233\'00\'E9cor, or the bar prices, but who else is inside. You walk past a string of empty nightclubs \u8212\'20\'14 everyone wants to go to the happening one, even when you have to queue for an hour for the cloakroom. That\u8217\'20\'19s London \u8212\'20\'14 topsy-turvy economics where the more people who come, the more want to come. And the bigger it is, the more people want to be in it, and so it carries on. You\u8217\'20\'19ve got this unstoppable force of growth and density."\par \par \uc2 Britain now faces a dilemma, says Davis. Sitting in a small orange booth near the Today studio, he ponders: \u8220\'20\'1CDo we feed the London beast to accommodate its growth? We can\u8217\'20\'19t let London get broken because it\u8217\'20\'19s the engine of the UK. But if we keep feeding in the money to maintain it, you\u8217\'20\'19re never going to have other engines working elsewhere." So far, so fence-sitting. Davis waves his arms, today clad in a glittery grey and black sweater, like a conductor\u8217\'20\'19s baton to stress his points. But he started working at the Beeb 21 years ago and struggles to give opinions. Occasionally he conflates himself with the broadcaster, with phrases such as \u8220\'20\'1CObviously, the BBC doesn\u8217\'20\'19t have views" when asked for his own ones.\par \par \uc2 But asked how to solve the \u8220\'20\'1CLondon vs \u8216\'20\'18the rest\u8217\'20\'19" issue, Davis comes to a compromise. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m a construction nut so I\u8217\'20\'19d overspend on infrastructure, everywhere. I wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t economise on London but I don\u8217\'20\'19t want the North to be abandoned. I think a proper second city, in Manchester or Birmingham or somewhere else, would help spread the power. But building one up while maintaining London \u8212\'20\'14 that comes with a cost."\par \par \uc2 That bill for new infrastructure is increasingly picked up by foreign credit cards. On his new programme, Davis visits London Gateway, the \u163\'00\'A31.5 billion super-port in Essex built with cash from Dubai, and Battersea power station\u8217\'20\'19s \u163\'00\'A38 billion redevelopment scheme, backed by Malaysian money. Davis supports the investment \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s not like the ports and other foreign-owned infrastructure can be lifted up and taken to Dubai or wherever" \u8212\'20\'14 but he thinks the capital\u8217\'20\'19s foreign billionaires should pay more tax.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLondon is giving quite a lot to people who settle here \u8212\'20\'14 a ticket to security, stability, cultural opportunity. I think we need to ask ourselves, are we charging the right price for that? If you make it too cheap to come to London, you\u8217\'20\'19re not serving the interests of the domestic population. How much should an oligarch pay to have two houses in London? But I worry that we\u8217\'20\'19re underpricing."\par \par \uc2 Charging more isn\u8217\'20\'19t the same as chasing foreigners away, though. \u8220\'20\'1CIt ill behoves people who\u8217\'20\'19ve gravitated to London from elsewhere to be indignant about others who have gravitated to London from elsewhere," Davis solemnly states. He loves London\u8217\'20\'19s multi-culturalism, and the fact that here he can be \u8220\'20\'1Ca presenter who is gay rather than a gay presenter".\par \par \uc2 As we walk from New Broadcasting House towards Oxford Circus, Davis admits he also likes the fact that Londoners are \u8220\'20\'1Cover the whole \u8216\'20\'18Ooh gay, oooh piercing thing\u8217\'20\'19". Alas, those are the two facts everyone I tell I\u8217\'20\'19m interviewing Davis brings up (he\u8217\'20\'19s rumoured to have a \u8220\'20\'1CPrince Albert").\par \par \uc2 Still, there are higher-minded things occupying Davis\u8217\'20\'19s brain. He\u8217\'20\'19s concerned London\u8217\'20\'19s housing crisis is turning the capital into Los Angeles, where he lived for a few months in the late Eighties. \u8220\'20\'1CLA has a lot of very rich people and quite a lot of Hispanic people working for them, but you struggle to find any ordinary people." Londoners, Davis frets, \u8220\'20\'1Care being pushed out of their own city".\par \par \uc2 His own home, an Earl\u8217\'20\'19s Court flat shared with his French long-term partner, architect Guillaume Baltz, fuels concerns about the housing market. \u8220\'20\'1CI paid \u163\'00\'A3100,000 for it in 1996, it\u8217\'20\'19s in a small block of six flats, and two just sold for utterly silly prices. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I do worry that there\u8217\'20\'19s a property bubble."\par \par \uc2 What would he do about it? \u8220\'20\'1CYou could imagine using the planning system to say there are houses for occupation and houses for investment, and when this house is sold, it has to be occupied. But we don\u8217\'20\'19t generally use our planning system that way."\par \par \uc2 It's not just for struggling young Londoners that Davis is worried about property prices. In Mind the Gap: London vs the Rest, he strolls around a \u163\'00\'A340 million Mayfair pad and waves around plans for the \u163\'00\'A3750,000 redeveloped flats of the old Heygate Estate in Elephant & Castle. \u8220\'20\'1CBy far the biggest worry I have about the programme is that we\u8217\'20\'19ll get a property crash, and someone will go back and look at the programme and use it as archive footage to say, \u8216\'20\'18Look how deluded and hubristic they were back then\u8217\'20\'19."\par \par \uc2 Still, housing and infrastructure problems aside, Davis says he\u8217\'20\'19s now a Londoner for life. \u8220\'20\'1CWhere we live, it\u8217\'20\'19s dense and noisy and, being near Chelsea & Westminster Hospital, full of sirens, but I can go out and buy a pint of milk in the middle of the night by walking 50 metres from my home. I love urban living."\par \par \uc2 He enjoys the odd escape, too. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m not going to lie," says Davis in a rare drift from Radio 4 diction, \u8220\'20\'1Cwe do have, er, a bolthole, a place in northern France we can escape to. But I couldn\u8217\'20\'19t move away permanently." He\u8217\'20\'19s not planning on switching jobs either, despite the 3.15am wake-up call for Today. \u8220\'20\'1CI can\u8217\'20\'19t think of anything else I\u8217\'20\'19m capable of doing now, and maybe I\u8217\'20\'19m not even capable of doing that," he grins. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a nice job.

She recalls how Jewish fans influenced the subculture's managers, labels and journalists\b0\par\par\uc2 Vivien Goldman   \par \uc2 1,505 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Who put the Oy in Oi? Surprise is the default reaction, and sometimes even\par \par \uc2 disapproval, when I mention the Jews in Punk panel I am moderating for London's Jewish Book Week. And no wonder. Punks and Jews really are a contradiction in terms. Orthodox Judaism means following a body of rules as closely as possible, whereas punk is the reverse.\par \par \uc2 But being a first-generation Brit, first-wave punk and Jewish in a time still closely touched by the second world war did have its conundrums. Witness an incident at my New Year's Eve party 1976/77, held in my basement flat in Ladbroke Grove in west London. The reggae soundsystem had started playing, rather late, when my friend Viv Albertine, the guitar player of the Slits, turned up with her pal Sid Vicious. Not yet a Sex Pistol, poor Sid's insecurities were camouflaged by black leather and a large swastika. When he walked in, the Rastas took one look and started packing up the speakers. Sid was no nazi: his dying love was\par \par \uc2 a Jewess, Nancy Spungen. But understanding the price of style, Sid and\par \par \uc2 Viv left for a less sensitive gathering.\par \par \uc2 A lucky break for me, as the Rastas saved me from one of those ghastly confrontations I avoided where possible. Being of refugee German Jewish descent, I saw concentration camp numbers on the arms of my\par \par \uc2 parents' friends. Swastikas made me feel sick, even though I told myself they were an ancient Aryan symbol and that punks just wore them to piss off their parents. It was hardly worth\par \par \uc2 debating, anyway, as the pat response was always that they were simply\par \par \uc2 cool and anti-establishment; genuine\par \par \uc2 believers in the swastika rarely gave their true identities away. The swastika also caused an argument between two Jewish manager/theorists of punk,\par \par \uc2 the Pistols' Malcolm McLaren, and his friend, the Clash's svengali,\par \par \uc2 Bernie Rhodes. Fast-talking McLaren embraced being what my late mother called "a disgrace to the race".\par \par \uc2 Activist, artist and punk chronicler Caroline Coon recalls the 100 Club's first punk festival in 1976. Malcolm started handing out swastika armbands he'd had made. Siouxsie of the\par \par \uc2 Banshees put one on right away and some of the Pistols seemed ready to follow suit. Aghast, Rhodes blurted out that if anyone wore swastikas onstage, they couldn't use the Clash's instruments as planned. The Clash backed him up. The gig went on. No swastikas.\par \par \uc2 The subverted symbol might not have been of much concern, had it not been for the growing reach of the\par \par \uc2 National Front, which at that time of social crisis was gaining traction and used punk for youth recruitment. Writing for Sounds, the punk rock weekly, I infiltrated a National Front fundraiser gig by the band Skrewdriver, and wound up in a Holborn pub with a leather-clad NF spokesman, eager to recruit girls. Blithely he ranted against \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , Jews and the "coffee-coloured morons" who would soon ruin England. When he asked me for a date, I had to say: "Maybe not a good idea. I'm Jewish." A beat. "Oh, well,\par \par \uc2 we can always make an exception," he replied cheerfully. Which made it sweeter when he wrote to me, complaining that after the article was published, the Front had kicked him out.\par \par \uc2 So the NF united Jews in opposition, and located us on barricades alongside our fellow tribal Brits. Despite its general whiteness, punk's bond with reggae made it the first artistic expression\par \par \uc2 of the new multicultural society.\par \par \uc2 Having been the main "other" in WASPy England for so long, maybe Jews were finally one British tribe among many.\par \par \uc2 Apart from \uc2 Mick Jones\uc2  of the Clash, Jon Moss - who drummed with several punk bands before Culture Club - and a few others, our input was more on the ideological, art, media and business side. Judaism was not discussed much. I knew that \uc2 Geoff Travis\uc2 , the founder of pioneering indie label Rough Trade, was inspired to structure its socialist business model on the time he had spent on a kibbutz. In a rare moment of same-faith bonding, NME writer Charles Shaar Murray told me that his grandmother had to scrub pavements for the Nazis in Vienna, which he felt drew him to the blues and all sufferers'\par \par \uc2 music, such as punk.\par \par \uc2 As for the two managers, McLaren's charm was the flipside of a master manipulator. Both he and Rhodes aimed to control their teenage musicians absolutely, like dictators. Nonetheless, they helped create and project the free-thinking conceptual climate in which punk spread ideas, made money, and delivered enduring music. These days, punk is established as the international sound of rebellious youth, grown locally in any trouble spot. That is not because of New York's garage rock. It's because of the sort of UK punk energy those managers encouraged.\par \par \uc2 I happily embraced punk's ungodly Year Zero. My musician father, who\par \par \uc2 always said he had escaped from Gestapo HQ in Berlin, cautioned me to remember that I was British, not English; never to feel too safe, even at home. That sense of life on a faultline made UK Jews, us first-generation ones anyway, perfect candidates for punk, an inclusionary haven for marginalised misfits and outsiders. Belonging to a generation that launched Rock Against Racism made me feel more secure.\par \par \uc2 In a classically angst-ridden Jewish ambivalence about identity, the New York punk Richard Hell - of Television, the Heartbreakers and the Voidoids - has said he doesn't like to be defined by the fact that his father is Jewish. But he's one of many Jewish (or Jewish-ish?)\par \par \uc2 artists on the New York scene, such as Joey Ramone, Lenny Kaye of the \uc2 Patti Smith\uc2  Group and Blondie's Chris Stein, who overcame his Holocaust paranoia by collecting Nazi artefacts. (The\par \par \uc2 concerns of punky American Jews are documented by by Steven Lee Beeber in his book The Heebie-Jeebies at CBGB's). In a documentary I made for BBC 6\par \par \uc2 Music, A Tale of Two Punk Cities, Talking Heads' Tina Weymouth recalled that New York punks thought people who talked politics were a bore. But to us, the ideas expressed in Anarchy In The UK and White Riot were real. The G2 or Second Generation theory, whereby children\par \par \uc2 of Holocaust survivors are often socially conscious activists, could have had something to do with it, however it was never discussed.\par \par \uc2 But the Yanks were trying to forget Vietnam, while we were still living among bombsites in our own civil war zone, fighting teds, skinheads and\par \par \uc2 rockers as well as the sus law and the National Front. Our punky Jew experience was also different because British punk mostly inhabited a shared political landscape, as well as views of the kind that McLaren and Rhodes helped to spread, which manifested in organisations such as Rock Against Racism.\par \par \uc2 Nowadays I teach about punk in universities, to sophisticated New York\par \par \uc2 students. Many of them regard LGBT rights as the last remaining major social issue of their generation (that's not to diminish their importance). Getting the correlation between, say, White Riot and the Clash's own experience of conflict, and seeing how it describes the street-fighting Britain of the time, sometimes comes as a surprise. The immediacy of pop reacting in protest is not dead, but the life support is beeping.\par \par \uc2 So the whole idea of Jews in punk arguably now has a quaint ring to it; the sound of a time when music responded quickly to battle lines that were clearly drawn and nervy underdogs were\par \par \uc2 fighting in the streets for a cause, then singing about it. Today's enemy is\par \par \uc2 diffused via infinite surveillance cameras and servers, not as easy to smash with a brick; and militant music is less fashionable than vinyl. But still, Jews these days feel beleaguered, what with the hostility to Israel on UK campuses spilling over into non-specific anti-Jewish feeling, and the quenelle debacle in France. Our old foes are on the rise again in Europe and an even worse toxic mess of unemployment and anger is feeding the microclimate in which they flourish.\par \par \uc2 This grim vortex, of course, is an ideal condition for punk and what I like to think of as a Jewish contribution. Take the inherited trauma of generations of exile and suffering, use it to up your empathy, and channel it energetically, using culture, for the world you want. In short: be as punk as possible.\par \par \uc2 Vivien Goldman chairs The Jewish Roots of Punk at Kings Place, N1, on 1 Mar\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Cash from chaos . . .

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Politics: Merkel hints at EU treaty change but warns Cameron to rein in ambitions: Deal doable but not a piece of cake, says chancellor: Downing Street welcomes signals as 'realistic'\b0\par\par\uc2 Nicholas Watt, Chief political correspondent   \par \uc2 798 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  has taken the first tentative steps towards outlining a modest framework for negotiations to persuade British voters to remain within the EU, in an\par \par \uc2 in-out referendum which David Cameron will call by the end of 2017 if he wins next year's general election.\par \par \uc2 The German chancellor, who pleaded with Britain in a speech to a joint session of parliament yesterday to remain a "strong voice" within the EU, declared in Downing Street that a deal was "doable" though she warned that the negotiations would not be a "piece of cake".\par \par \uc2 Merkel said that Britain would have to win the support of the 27 other leaders of the EU, and added: "If one wants Britain to remain in the EU, which is what I want, if one at the same time wants a competitive union that generates growth, one can find common solutions."\par \par \uc2 But she moved to inject a dose of reality by saying that her main priority was to strengthen the euro - by ensuring monetary union was matched by an economic union among eurozone members - with "clear-cut and resilient architecture". The chancellor indicated that this would involve treaty change. But in a warning to Cameron, who would like to use such negotiations to table his demands, she said this would be limited and would leave little room for special treatment for one member state. Merkel said: "I believe we need to adapt the legal foundations of the monetary union in a limited, targeted and speedy way to stabilise the union for the long term."\par \par \uc2 MPs and peers laughed as Merkel, who recalled her first visit to London in the spring of 1990 shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, said those expecting a "fundamental reform of the European architecture" in Britain's direction would be disappointed. Opening her speech at the Palace of Westminster in English, Merkel said: "I have been told many times during the last few days that there are very special expectations of my speech here today. Supposedly, or so I have heard, some expect my speech to pave the way for a fundamental reform of the European architecture, which will satisfy all kinds of alleged or actual British wishes. I am afraid they are in for a disappointment."\par \par \uc2 Downing Street was delighted with the signals from Merkel, which it regarded as helpful but realistic. The prime minister said: "I believe that what I am setting out, the sort of changes Britain wants to see to build confidence in our membership of this organisation, are possible and deliverable and doable."\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Douglas Alexander\uc2 , the shadow foreign secretary, who met Merkel with Ed Miliband, said: The gap between what Chancellor Merkel was offering, and what [Cameron's] eurosceptic backbenchers are demanding remains as wide as ever."\par \par \uc2 The visit by Merkel was the most significant intervention by a German chancellor in London since Helmut Schmidt pleaded with the Labour party to embrace the European project in a speech at Methodist Central Hall, Westminster, before the 1975 EEC referendum. Merkel kicked off her day with a speech to a joint session of parliament in the royal gallery, which is decorated with the Daniel Maclise portrait of the meeting of the Duke of Wellington and the Prussian field marshal Blucher before the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.\par \par \uc2 Merkel, whose warm welcome contrasted with the low-key reception for the French president, \uc2 Francois Hollande\uc2 , at last month's Anglo-French summit at RAF Brize Norton, headed after her speech to Downing Street for a brief meeting with Nick Clegg. The prime minister then hosted a lunch for Merkel which included a main course of Newlyn stone bass.\par \par \uc2 Merkel made clear at a joint press conference with Cameron that she was prepared to help Britain - while stressing that her patience was finite - as she outlined a framework for the negotiations. These will cover:\par \par \uc2 * A renewed focus on the claiming of benefits by migrants within the EU. Merkel made clear she would resist any attempt to restrict freedom of movement within the EU. But she added: "Is \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  into social security possible? No country in Europe would be able to withstand such an onslaught because we have very different social security systems."\par \par \uc2 * Assurances that EU members outside the eurozone would not be outmanoeuvred in the single market.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Merkel, pictured with the Queen at Buckingham Palace, said Britain should remain a strong voice in the EU but there was little room for special treatment Photo: Reuters\par \par \uc2 A welcome in Downing Street; and Merkel after her address to parliament\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140228ea2s0001h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 May's target in tatters after surprise jump in migration to Britain from EU: Net arrivals in UK up more than 30% over past year: Rise fuelled by migrants from southern Europe\b0\par\par\uc2 Alan Travis, Home affairs editor   \par \uc2 794 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A rise of more than 30% in net migration to Britain over the past year to 212,000 has dashed Conservative hopes of meeting their target of bringing the figure below 100,000 before the general election.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  said the unexpected rise of 58,000 in the 12 months to last September has mainly been fuelled by migrants from the recession-hit southern European countries of Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece, as well as Poland.\par \par \uc2 Net migration to Britain from the EU has doubled in the past year and EU \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is at the highest level since 1964.\par \par \uc2 A continuing fall in emigration from Britain has contributed to the rise in the net migration figure, and the ONS said migrants from the latest EU entrants, Romania and Bulgaria, have added 14,000 to the figure before the lifting of transitional controls on 1 January.\par \par \uc2 This is the third consecutive quarter that the politically sensitive benchmark of net migration - the number coming to live in Britain for more than 12 months minus those leaving to live abroad for longer than 12 months - has risen.\par \par \uc2 The home secretary, Theresa May, made the Conservative pledge to reduce net migration to the "tens of thousands" by the time of next year's general election the central target of her \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy. The chances of meeting that target appear to be disappearing fast.\par \par \uc2 If the upward trend continues she may leave office with a higher net migration figure than the 244,000 estimated when she became home secretary in 2010.\par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrats have consistently disowned the target, stressing that it is not coalition policy.\par \par \uc2 The figures show that 532,000 people migrated to Britain in the year ending last September. The figure includes 60,000 more EU \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and 25,000 \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from the rest of the world compared with a year previously. More than 218,000 were students.\par \par \uc2 A total of 320,000 emigrants left Britain last year, 23,000 fewer than the previous year and the lowest level since 2008, when the number peaked at 427,000.\par \par \uc2 These factors combined to increase net migration from 154,000 in the year to September 2012 to 212,000 in the year to September 2013.\par \par \uc2 The ONS figures show that the measures May has taken to curb non-EU migration have bitten quite deeply but have been overshadowed by the rise in migration from within Europe.\par \par \uc2 Overall figures for non-EU migration show that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from outside Europe fell from 269,000 to 244,000. This reflected May's curbs on student migration - the number of those coming to study at further education colleges is down by 34% and the number of overseas students from India has fallen by 21%, and from Pakistan by 55%. The number of family visas granted has gone down by 7,202.\par \par \uc2 Student numbers rose by 4% in the year to December 2013, with a 7% rise in university students, including a 9% rise in students from China and a 147% increase from Brazil.\par \par \uc2 Registrations of new national insurance numbers for adults entering Britain rose by 19% to 617,000 in 2013 with the highest increases for those coming from Poland (31,000), Italy (18,000), Spain (14,000) and Portugal (10,000).\par \par \uc2 Asylum applications rose by 8% in the 12 months to September 2013 to 23,507 with the largest rises from Syria (up 681), Eritrea and Albania.\par \par \uc2 The London First business group said the figures meant it was "game over" for the Conservatives' "arbitrary" \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  target.\par \par \uc2 "What we need to be wary of is the government trying to control future figures by further limiting the only number it has power over - non-EU migrants," said Mark Hilton, London First's head of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy. "In the past this has hit both highly skilled \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  that we need, as well as foreign students, who are a huge economic asset: higher education is our eighth-biggest export industry, valued at pounds 8bn."\par \par \uc2 The new \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, James Brokenshire, said: "The government is ensuring that our controls on accessing benefits and services, including the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and social housing, are among the tightest in Europe.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot impose formal \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  controls on EU migrants, so we are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and seeking to address the factors that drive European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to Britain."\par \par \uc2 Brokenshire stressed that nearly 70,000 fewer migrants were coming to Britain than in 2010 when the government took office.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140228ea2s0002u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The care system would collapse without migrant workers because British young people do not have the skills to fill jobs in the sector, a health minister has said.\par \par \uc2 Norman Lamb said that foreign workers were propping up the system because training British people for such roles had been a "massive failure" in the past.\par \par \uc2 His words come as the government was accused of losing its grip on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy after figures from the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  showed net migration - the difference between those coming into Britain and those leaving rose by a third in the 12 months to the end of September.\par \par \uc2 It now stands at 212,000 compared to 154,000 the previous year leading Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, to claim David Cameron's pledge to bring net migration down to the tens of thousands "unworkable."\par \par \uc2 Mr Lamb, the Liberal Democrat minister responsible for care, said that, in the past, giving youngsters the right skills to compete had been a "massive failure."\par \par \uc2 He told the Eastern Daily press that "balanced view" should be taken of figures which showed some 24,000 Romanians and Bulgarians arrived in the year to September 2013 - nearly three times the 9,000 who arrived in the previous year.\par \par \uc2 The ONS said around 70 per cent came to work, while 30 per cent came to study and Mr Lamb said young people in Britain often didn't have the skills to do the jobs that migrants were coming to do.\par \par \uc2 He said: "I'm acutely aware, for example, in my own area of interest that the care system in Norfolk, let alone everywhere else, would collapse without workers from other countries.\par \par \uc2 "The vast bulk of people who come to this country come to work and we benefit from that," he added.\par \par \uc2 "What we have been clear about is that our youngsters need to have the skills to compete for jobs... It is very tempting to claim that these people are coming into our system to take our benefits, but most are doing pretty vital jobs in care, in the hotel and hospitality industry. Most of these people are working very hard and contributing to our economy."\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140228ea2s003pj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Young people spend too long looking at their smartphones to be creative or to get angry about the world around them, according to Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who.\par \par \uc2 The singer was asked last night why young musicians like One Direction do not sing about social issues in the way that bands used to and why young people no longer voice their anger at the political system.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt seems to me the world has gone bloody mad. Everywhere you look people are walking around like this..." he said, mimicking those who hold their smartphones up to their faces and tap away at the screen.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s this whole wonderful planet and beautiful sea of humanity that\u8217\'20\'19s out there, but people are like this for more than half the day and it does concern me. I know it teaches people to learn quicker, but where\u8217\'20\'19s the time to contemplate? Where do the epiphanies come from? Maybe that\u8217\'20\'19s why."\par \par \uc2 Some of The Who\u8217\'20\'19s most iconic songs, including My Generation and and Won\u8217\'20\'19t Get Fooled Again, drew heavily on the political and social issues of the time, but modern music has stopped commenting on the wider world, Daltrey explained at a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://http://www.mytimesplus.co.uk/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Times+}}}\uc2  event for Times subscribers last night.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s an awful lot out there, if I was young, that I\u8217\'20\'19d be extremely angry about in our society," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s a lot of things that need fixing."\par \par \uc2 Asked if he liked the music of young groups like One Direction, he said he admired their hard work and their fanbase, but added: \u8220\'20\'1CDo I like their music? Not particularly. They haven\u8217\'20\'19t done anything very creative."\par \par \uc2 Daltrey {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3924571.ece"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 spoke out last year about the scapegoating suffered by \b immigrants\b0 }}}\uc2 , blaming politicians for failing to implement strict enough controls on pay.\par \par \uc2 When asked what issues were currently angering him, he replied: \u8220\'20\'1CHave you got all night?"\par \par \uc2 He went on to explain that, if human beings are responsible for climate change, we need to find a \u8220\'20\'1Creal solution".\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat they\u8217\'20\'19re throwing up at us with windmills and solar panels are chocolate teapots. We need to find a serious solution."\par \par \uc2 He also called on the \uc2 NHS\uc2  to treat teenagers differently from both children and adults and praised the work of the \uc2 Teenage Cancer Trust\uc2 , of which he is a patron, for recognising they had unique medical and psychological needs.\par \par \uc2 Daltrey confirmed that The Who was still an \u8220\'20\'1Congoing" band and was speaking alongside Wilko Johnson, with whom he is due to release Going Back Home, a new album, on March 10.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140228ea2s003pe\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 How long will it take for China to replace the US?\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Tang   \par \uc2 801 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 17:32\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Following my recommendation of a Cornish pasty and a can of Diet Coke on a bench at King's Cross station as a suitable St Valentine's dinner, I have received several alternative suggestions for venues, such as the restaurant at Spean Bridge station on the line to Fort William, Scotland, and the oyster bar at Grand Central in New York.\par \par \uc2 I have never been to the former, although I might have glimpsed it once when I went to Fort William to stay at Inverlochy Castle, a hotel that is supposedly the epitome of Scottish luxury, which, given the legendary tightness of the Scots, might sound like an oxymoron.\par \par \uc2 As for the oyster bar at Grand Central, which I have been to, I admit the station is one of the most splendid interiors of modern time. The only trouble is the obvious association of the oyster as an aphrodisiac which might send a presumptuous message to the girl. And would she even enjoy slurping up a slimy lump that is still on the move and breathing its last breath? How anti-climatic it would be if she were to pass on the oyster and opt for the much duller plate of smoked salmon or prawn cocktail? Much simpler to leave food out of it.\par \par \uc2 My main point is to appreciate utilitarian spaces such as King's Cross, with its draughty promise of yet draughtier destinations, without the slightest hint of anything fancy, thereby creating a real juxtaposition of ostensible dullness and real cerebral excitement that never fails to intensify our sense of romance.\par \par \uc2 . . .\par \par \uc2 I'm living in Brooklyn. Who in Brooklyn originated the floral arrangement you described?\par \par \uc2 It is extraordinary that the best imitators of old Dutch flower arrangements in paintings should be found in Brooklyn, and more extraordinarily on Van Dyke Street. The shop is called Saipua, which sounds Asian but is actually Finnish. So there you have it: one of those marvellous liquorice allsorts in life that is the stuff of serendipities. If I were a billionaire, I would call them twice a week to deliver their bouquets to my home in Hong Kong, an Atacama of decorative charm.\par \par \uc2 . . .\par \par \uc2 How long do you think it will take for China to replace the US as the world's number one superpower, and do you think that Chinese culture will impact the west as American culture has impacted the east?\par \par \uc2 As this is the Financial Times, I calculated that if the US grows at an average of 2 per cent per annum and China 5 per cent per annum, then China would still need about 75 years to catch up the US in terms of GDP per capita [I sincerely hope Martin Wolf doesn't read this - Ed.]. Of course this sole economic measure is not the only factor, but it is a telling indicator. I argued at an Oxford Union debate last year for a similar timeframe with the addition of other factors, mainly demographic, environmental and political.\par \par \uc2 The truth is that there are too many extraneous interactions in the world for us to predict the future. Our history is strewn with surprises, and I am constantly astonished by the turn of events that are characterised either by freak incidents or what Barbara Tuchman called "the march of folly", a reminder that we humans never seem to learn from our mistakes. The course of history has always deflected from the obvious and the proposition that China is going to overtake the US is too obvious.\par \par \uc2 I also observe that, in the past, superpowers invariably grew through conquests from a minority overwhelming a majority - the Roman, Ottoman and British empires being clear examples. And the US, too, except her masses grew from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rather than conquest. Therefore, I ask what would it take for China, which is already vast, to become even more vast?\par \par \uc2 As for the canard of comparing east and west, spoiled by the Kipling ditty that "never the twain shall meet", globalisation has brought the distinction much closer. China's history in the 20th century has been sculpted by almost all western precepts, viz, democracy and republicanism, capitalism and Marxism. So one must be careful in regurgitating the ancient Chinese culture of Confucianism and 4,000 years of successive dynastic empires in today's context. The truth is modern China is already intellectually much more westernised than one might imagine. It is only in humour that I still detect a gulf that has not closed up too much.\par \par \uc2 -------------------------------------------\par \par \uc2 I would like readers to post comments and questions online at the end of articles rather than via email. That way we can have a debate of spontaneous and dynamic responses, an arena for opposing views.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140228ea2s003mq\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Hypocrite Hopkins! Katie attacks Rebecca Adlington for bowing to bullies... just like her\b0\par\par\uc2 Emma Kelly   \par \uc2 637 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 13:21\par \uc2 dailystar.co.uk\par \uc2 DAICO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 KATIE Hopkins usually spends her days bullying pop stars and TV personalities about their weight, family or career.\par \par \uc2 But the rent-a-gob has now decided to bully someone for bowing to the pressure of bullies \u8211\'20\'13 and blasted the bullies themselves too.\par \par \uc2 Confused? Yeah, us too.\par \par \uc2 The former Apprentice star has blasted Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington for reportedly getting surgery to decrease the size of her nose.\par \par \uc2 After tweeting earlier this week that Becky's nose job was a "big mistake", Hopkins elaborated on why the Olympic medallist's confidence boost was such a disastrous move.\par \par \uc2 In her column for The Sun, the gobby TV personality wrote: "They picked on your nose, but you changed it. What's next, Becky? Your eyes? Your hair? Your boobs?"\par \par \uc2 She also moaned that Rebecca had "let them [internet trolls] win" by going under the knife, before adding: "You'd think that a gold medal would make you invincible."\par \par \uc2 Katie also compared the Olympic hero to HERSELF \u8211\'20\'13 labelling Becky "my lookalike", and saying that the blonde's looks "invited scorn".\par \par \uc2 But in the midst of the bizarre double standards, Katie did throw in a few giggles \u8211\'20\'13 namely by referring to herself as Concorde, Horse Face and Beaky.\par \par \uc2 Katie Hopkins\par \par \uc2 Hopkins, who has riled viewers with her obnoxious views on The Big Benefit Row and The Big \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Row, bit back at those who used her looks as a source of insults, writing: "I am happy with my nose. I can use it as a sundial if I'm in the mood."\par \par \uc2 While Katie \u8211\'20\'13 shock horror \u8211\'20\'13 actually seemed to be on Rebecca's side, telling her not to listen to the bullies, in typical Hopkins fashion she managed to make matters worse for the jungle babe.\par \par \uc2 Becky famously broke down in tears after spending time with beauty queen Amy Willerton in the I'm a Celeb jungle, and comedian Frankie Boyle joked that the star had "the face of a dolphin".\par \par \uc2 In an interview with the Times last year, the engaged swimmer admitted that she never found herself "particularly attractive", and said: "I\u8217\'20\'19ve got a very big nose. That\u8217\'20\'19s what most of the negative comments on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  are about \u8212\'20\'14 my nose.\par \par \uc2 "People say, 'Oh God you look like a dolphin,' or 'I didn\u8217\'20\'19t realise they let whales into the Olympics, but at least you should be able to swim faster with a nose like that'."\par \par \uc2 While many of Katie's followers agreed that Becky shouldn't have let bullies affect her confidence, some pointed out the hypocrisy in her argument.\par \par \uc2 One girl tweeted: "How Katie Hopkins can criticise Rebecca Adlington's bullies when she openly bullies women on their appearances is beyond me."\par \par \uc2 When not blasting those who listen to the harsh words of bullies, Katie has been insulting Lily Allen for becoming "hideous" and "fat" during pregnancy; telling CBB's Liz Jones that she has a "flat face"; calling Sam Bailey "a fat mum in a jumpsuit"; and labelling Little Mix's Jesy Nelson a "chubber".\par \par \uc2 In fact, just days after her original tweets blasting Adlington, Katie took to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to say: "12 is definitely a size called fat", and asked followers: "Do fat people deliberately wear over tight clothes. Or did they get bigger and keep on imagining they fitted?"\par \par \uc2 Internet trolls blasting other internet trolls \u8211\'20\'13 and so the vicious circle of bullying continues.\par \par \uc2 Related articles The Big British \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Row Live: Katie Hopkins and Luisa Zissman face off Katie Hopkins causes a stir on The Big Benefits Row: Live TOWIE's Gemma Collins calls Katie Hopkins a cringe of a woman after sick weight insults Lily Allen lashes out at Katie Hopkins after rent-a-gob insults her pregnancy weight gain\par \par \uc2 Document DAICO00020140228ea2s002bd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 UKIP embarrassed by rehash of BNP\u8217\'20\'19s \u8216\'20\'18Love Britain\u8217\'20\'19 slogan\b0\par\par\uc2 Laura Pitel, Political Correspondent   \par \uc2 442 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 13:57\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 UKIP faced embarrassment today after unveiling a new slogan almost identical to one used by the British National Party.\par \par \uc2 The party used its spring conference in Torquay to launch the \u8220\'20\'1CLove Britain, Vote UKIP" motto.\par \par \uc2 It quickly emerged, however, that the words \u8220\'20\'1CLove Britain, Vote BNP" had previously been used by the far-Right party.\par \par \uc2 The BNP was sued in 2010 by \uc2 Unilever\uc2  after using a picture of a jar of Marmite in its campaign alongside the slogan.\par \par \uc2 A party spokesman said that the BNP still used the motto. \u8220\'20\'1CThey\u8217\'20\'19ve stolen our policies," he said, \u8220\'20\'1Cand now they\u8217\'20\'19ve stolen our slogan."\par \par \uc2 A UKIP spokesman said \u8220\'20\'1CWe don\u8217\'20\'19t care about the BNP."\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage, leader of UKIP, used his conference speech to rally the troops in advance of the May European election, at which it hopes to ride a wave of Euroscepticism to secure first place.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said the growing support for his party posed \u8220\'20\'1Cthe biggest threat to the political establishment that has been seen in modern times" and urged voters to use the poll to \u8220\'20\'1Ccause an earthquake in British politics".\par \par \uc2 The key issue, he said, would be migration and the \u8220\'20\'1Cirresponsible" numbers of people coming to the UK from abroad.\par \par \uc2 Scores of market towns across Britain were becoming \u8220\'20\'1Cunrecognisable", he claimed, because of an influx of foreign workers.\par \par \uc2 His closing remarks made a sideways reference to the slogan fiasco.

He said \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  would dominate the polls in May.\par \par \uc2 And Mr Farage told the conference: "80% of us in this country believe open door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is irresponsible, against the interests of the people in this country and that it must stop.\par \par \uc2 "We have seen since 2004 a doubling of youth unemployment, we have seen since that time wage compression - people doing jobs now taking home less money than they were 10 years ago.\par \par \uc2 "All of this has happened because we now have a totally distorted labour market in Britain, because of the massive oversupply that has come to us from eastern Europe.\par \par \uc2 "It's ordinary folk, it's ordinary families that are paying the financial price. But what about the social price of this?\par \par \uc2 "The fact that in scores of our cities and market towns, this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognisable.\par \par \uc2 "Whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don't hear English spoken any more.\par \par \uc2 "This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader said none of the three traditional parties had any answers for the British people, claiming they "did not lift a finger" to stop freedom of movement restrictions on Romania and Bulgaria ending in January.\par \par \uc2 He highlighted yesterday's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  figures which showed a big increase in net migration, during a keynote address which drew frequent applause and a standing ovation.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said: "It isn't directly Romania and Bulgaria that I'm necessarily concerned about. What I'm really concerned about is the fact in the eurozone, in the Mediterranean there is no sign or prospect of any significant recovery at all.\par \par \uc2 "In fact, it is most likely the majority of Romanians who come to Britain don't come from Romania - they will come from Italy and Spain where there are already a million Romanian migrant workers.\par \par \uc2 "If the eurozone goes as badly over the next few years as I still believe that it will, we face the prospect of the largest migratory wave that has ever come to this country and we have three political parties who are not prepared to do anything about it."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said people who supported open door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  were welcome to back the Conservatives, Labour or the Liberal Democrats on May 22.\par \par \uc2 But he told his delegates: "If you believe we should govern our borders, if you believe we should control \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , if you believe we should have a sensible \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy where we have not just quantity control but we have quality control as well, if you believe we should model our \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system along the lines of a country like Australia, then vote Ukip on May 22."\par \par \uc2 He added: "Let's make patriotism a respectable political idea in Britain again."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said his party represented the biggest threat to the political mainstream for a generation.\par \par \uc2 He said: "Our ruling classes have lost confidence in this country and that is why they have sold us out and it's cost us money, it's cost us influence and it's cost us self-respect."\par \par \uc2 Broadening his themes on the failure of the existing political establishment, Mr Farage said the current regime had proved itself "unfit" during the floods crisis which hit Britain.\par \par \uc2 He called for a public inquiry into what went wrong at the hands of the Environment Agency and criticised the handing of powers to quangos which are "generally run by former failed politicians".\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said: "It is astonishing to me the Environment Agency's priorities for nearly 10 years have been to maintain the EU habitats directive, to put the interests of wading birds, molluscs, beetles and water voles above the interests of farmers and householders on the Somerset Levels.\par \par \uc2 "They even effectively been stopped from dredging because that is now classed as industrial waste and costs a lot of money."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said that, because insurance payouts would not cover all the losses, money from the international development budget should be redirected to compensate victims of the floods because it is a "strange unnatural disaster".\par \par \uc2 He added: "Surely this is a time when the principle of charity begins at home needs to be put into practice."\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140228ea2s003uy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

He said: \u8220\'20\'1COur counter-terrorism strategy is to go upstream to stop people coming here because it\u8217\'20\'19s much harder dealing with them when they are here.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut we haven\u8217\'20\'19t had a strategy for stopping foreign criminals. That\u8217\'20\'19s what we want to change." As well as preventing offending in this country, the new policy has been prompted by concern about the time and expense required to remove foreign criminals once they are here. Some manage to avoid deportation by using human rights laws.\par \par \uc2 One obstacle to blocking entry is the absence of accurate criminal records in some overseas countries.\par \par \uc2 Home Office and law enforcement staff here plan to address that byseeking better intelligence links with key target countries. Other assistance to improve the information on serious criminals living overseas will also be provided.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  laws enacted in Parliament allow citizens of the \uc2 European Economic Area\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 which covers EU states plus other countries such as Switzerland \u8212\'20\'14 to be excluded from the UK if the Home Secretary decides there are \u8220\'20\'1Cpublic security", health or other \u8220\'20\'1Cpublic policy" grounds.\par \par \uc2 Residents of non-EEA countries require visas, to which they have no automatic entitlement, making it relatively easy to block leading criminals once they are identified.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The use of exclusion to block extremists has already been expanded\u160\'00\'A0 significantly as part of the Government\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1CPrevent" counter-terrorism strategy.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 A Parliamentary report in 2012 said the measures included \u8220\'20\'1Cchanges to pre-departure checks to better identify people who pose a terrorist threat" and stop them flying to the UK.\par \par \uc2 Some foreigners given British passports have had their citizenship revoked because of involvement in\u160\'00\'A0 terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140228ea2s00466\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

London is losing out because of the visa regime. We understand the UK has to have strong borders, but you need better systems in place for business people who want to travel here and tourists who want to visit here. People want to experience London, in part because of what they saw during the Olympics."\par \par \uc2 BA launched a new route to Chengdu, a strong business region in south central China last year, and Mr Walsh added: \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s Chinese tourists particularly who find it difficult to come to the UK.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey are still coming, and that shows how strong the number of visitors could be, as the Chinese going through the difficulties of travelling here.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut if it was easier we\u8217\'20\'19d see a massive increase in tourists from China \u8212\'20\'14 and that would benefit the economy."\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140228ea2s0048t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Wide parts of Britain have changed out of recognition because the country has surrendered control of its borders, Nigel Farage claimed as he put \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at the forefront of the UK Independence Party\u8217\'20\'19s European election campaign.\par \par \uc2 He predicted the party was on course for the \u8220\'20\'1Cbiggest political shock" for years by beating Labour and the Tories to win the largest number of votes at the contests on May 22.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage also told activists at the Ukip spring conference that it was well placed to build a base in local government by picking up hundreds of seats in council elections on the same day.\par \par \uc2 But the conference launch was undermined by the disclosure that its new slogan \u8220\'20\'1CLove Britain" had previously been used by the BNP. A spokesman insisted Ukip was \u8220\'20\'1Creclaiming" the words from the far-Right party.\par \par \uc2 In his keynote address in Torquay, Mr Farage seized on figures this week showing a surge in net migration \u8211\'20\'13 mainly fuelled by the arrival of \uc2 European Union\uc2  workers \u8211\'20\'13 as evidence that Britain\u8217\'20\'19s frontiers were under unprecedented pressure.\par \par \uc2 In provocative remarks, he argued that communities across the country had irreparably altered as a result of mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and were not fit to pass on to future generations.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn scores of our cities and market towns, this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognisable.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don\u8217\'20\'19t hear English spoken any more.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."\par \par \uc2 He argued: \u8220\'20\'1CEighty per cent of us in this country believe open door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is irresponsible, against the interests of the people in this country and that it must stop."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage claimed Britain now had a \u8220\'20\'1Ctotally distorted labour market because of the massive oversupply that has come to us from eastern Europe". And he added: \u8220\'20\'1CIt is ordinary folk, it is ordinary families that are paying the financial price."\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader was speaking after a year in which the party has achieved a series of strong by-election performances, consistently outscored the Liberal Democrats in opinion polls and picked up nearly 150 local council seats.\par \par \uc2 He told the conference that the party represented the biggest threat to the political mainstream for a generation.\par \par \uc2 He added: \u8220\'20\'1COur ruling classes have lost confidence in this country and that is why they have sold us out and it has cost us money, it has cost us influence and it has cost us self-respect."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage insisted it was possible for several Ukip MPs to be elected at next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election, but urged his party to focus first on the European elections.\par \par \uc2 To laughter from activists, he mocked the idea his party was a \u8220\'20\'1Csplinter group" of the Conservatives and that the typical supporter was a \u8220\'20\'1Cretired half-colonel living on the edge of Salisbury Plain".\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8220\'20\'1COne fifth of our voters are people who would be described as non-voters, people who haven\u8217\'20\'19t voted for 20 years, in some cases people who have never voted in their lives and they are going out and voting Ukip.\par \par \uc2 "I think we should be very proud of the fact we are re-engaging people back in British democracy, I really do."\par \par \uc2 He also launched a staunch defence of his candidates and joked about the councillor who claimed gay marriage caused the flooding crisis.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140228ea2s0050n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 3,000 NZ visas granted to Britons helping to rebuild; More skilled construction workers from the UK have moved to Christchurch to repair the earthquake damage than from any other nation\b0\par\par\uc2 By Elizabeth Roberts   \par \uc2 461 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 16:29\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014.

That\u8217\'20\'19s 23 per cent higher than the previous peak in 2007, meaning that there are a number of long-term opportunities available for skilled British workers," she said.\par \par \uc2 The full list is available at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://skillshortages.immigration.govt.nz/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 skillshortages.\b immigration\b0 .govt.nz}}}\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Stephen Holder, from Brighton, Sussex, moved to New Zealand a year ago to work as a project manager on the Christchurch rebuilding effort. He was attracted by the country\u8217\'20\'19s unspoilt landscape, low population and varied outdoor activities.\par \par \uc2 "With the events that befell Christchurch there appeared to be a clear need for people with good construction experience and I felt compelled to be a part of the rebuild process," added Mr Holder.\par \par \uc2 Roger Stone, from Walsall, West Midlands, moved to Christchurch 18 months ago. He also works on the rebuilding project as a manager.\par \par \uc2 "We wanted a better lifestyle, a better work-life balance, a safer more friendly place to live and work, a better climate and a more active outdoor lifestyle," he said of his family\u8217\'20\'19s decision to move.\par \par \uc2 "I wanted to be part of the earthquake rebuild in Christchurch so I could make a difference for future generations."\par \par \uc2 As well as opportunities in the construction industry, the expos will feature recruiters from a number of other sectors including health care.\par \par \uc2 The first will be held at the Mercure Manchester Piccadilly Hotel on March 15 and 16. Another will be held at the Clyde Court Hotel in Dublin on March 19. The final expo will be held at the ILEC Conference Centre at the Ibis London, Earls Court, on March 22 and 23.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140228ea2s00568\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

We stopped at London Bridge, New Cross, Hither Green.\par \par \uc2 "It wasn't until after we got past Grove Park that I could actually hear English being audibly spoken in the carriage. Does that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes.\par \par \uc2 "I wonder what's really going on. And I'm sure that's a view that will be reflected by three quarters of the population, perhaps even more.\par \par \uc2 "That does not mean one is anti \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , we're not anti \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , we want \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , but we do absolutely believe we should be able to judge it both on quantity and quality."\par \par \uc2 In his earlier keynote speech, Mr Farage said: "The fact that in scores of our cities and market towns, this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognisable.\par \par \uc2 "Whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don't hear English spoken any more.\par \par \uc2 "This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."\par \par \uc2 Answering further questions at the press conference about why he felt awkward Mr Farage said: "Because I don't understand them."\par \par \uc2 And he added: "Not more English - English.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not saying people on trains should be forced to speak English... but what I am saying is we now have nearly 10% of our schools in our country where English is not the primary language in the homes those children come from.\par \par \uc2 "I think that is a concern and particularly as if you compare us to comparable countries in northern Europe. We have had a record of integration and race relations and religious tolerance that is not met, or even come close to, anyone else in Europe.\par \par \uc2 "So I do think the integration message is actually very, very important. If you have open door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  we have seen on the scale since New Labour came to power in 1997, it makes that transition very much harder.\par \par \uc2 "The answer is I don't feel very comfortable in that situation, I don't think the majority of British people do.\par \par \uc2 "It doesn't mean I am against anybody from different backgrounds or different cultures, far from it. I want us to have a sensible open minded \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy.\par \par \uc2 "What we have got and what we have had, and what we continue to have when it comes to the EU is wholly irresponsible and I think it has done great damage to the cohesion of our society."\par \par \uc2 In his earlier speech, Mr Farage said his party represented the biggest threat to the political mainstream for a generation.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader said his party would continue promoting \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as a key issue ahead of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  elections on May 22, insisting the main parties had failed Britain.\par \par \uc2 And he told the conference: "Our ruling classes have lost confidence in this country and that is why they have sold us out and it's cost us money, it's cost us influence and it's cost us self-respect."\par \par \uc2 Broadening his themes on the failure of the existing political establishment, Mr Farage said the current regime had proved itself "unfit" during the floods crisis which hit Britain.\par \par \uc2 He called for a public inquiry into what went wrong at the hands of the Environment Agency and criticised the handing of powers to quangos which are "generally run by former failed politicians".\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said: "It is astonishing to me the Environment Agency's priorities for nearly 10 years have been to maintain the EU habitats directive, to put the interests of wading birds, molluscs, beetles and water voles above the interests of farmers and householders on the Somerset Levels.\par \par \uc2 "They have even effectively been stopped from dredging because that is now classed as industrial waste and costs a lot of money."\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140228ea2s004mp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Ukip conference: Nigel Farage's damnation of Britain as a foreign land will do him no favours\b0\par\par\uc2 By James Kirkup   \par \uc2 506 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 17:03\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The UK Independence Party has been holding a conference in Torquay. In a few short hours, Nigel Farage, Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s dominant force, showed of the party\u8217\'20\'19s virtues and vices.\par \par \uc2 Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s virtues came to the fore when Mr Farage was talking about the curious and colourful views expressed by some of his party. Instead of doing what other politicians do and disowning the off-message stuff, Mr Farage embraces it and turns it into an attack on homogenised and collusive political class:\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re not career politicians, you\u8217\'20\'19re absolutely right. Unlike [Nick] Clegg, Cameron Miliband, d\u8217\'20\'19you know what? I actually had a job \u8211\'20\'13 I worked. And this is obviously fairly extraordinary in modern-day politics when almost everybody goes straight from \uc2 Oxford University\uc2  into a research office, they become Members of Parliament in their middle-late 20s and they\u8217\'20\'19re all very PC and no-one really says anything or stands up for their convictions, and with us you\u8217\'20\'19ve got people from all walks of life. There are 34,000 paid-up members of the party and some people have views that are mildly eccentric. I would have thought that was just consistent with democracy."\par \par \uc2 That sort of attack on the political establishment is surely Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s best hope of growing into something bigger than a niche party focussed on a small number of issues (Europe and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , mostly). It\u8217\'20\'19s also the attack that worries the older parties most, because it has the potential to attract people who wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t normally consider voting Ukip because of all the baggage the party carries.\par \par \uc2 That vice-heavy baggage was centre-stage during Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s conference speech, where he fulminated about the evils of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 :\par \par \uc2 "The fact that in scores of our cities and market towns, this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognisable. Whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don't hear English spoken any more. This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."\par \par \uc2 Yes, some people will admire and agree with those sentiments. But others might well be put off by the whiff of vitriol directed at this country, a country Ukip noisily says it loves.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cunrecognisable" diatribe calls to mind William Hague in 2001. He pitted his dystopian idea of Britain as \u8220\'20\'1Cforeign land" against Tony Blair\u8217\'20\'19s upbeat vision of confident and cool Britannia. He got thumped. There are few prizes in politics for being seen to dislike your own country.\par \par \uc2 Ukip is sometimes written off a party of political anger. There\u8217\'20\'19s actually nothing wrong with that: anger can be a powerful political force. But Mr Farage might want to take more care to focus his anger on Britain\u8217\'20\'19s political classes, and not the country itself.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140228ea2s005by\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 UKIP adopt BNP slogan as election battle-cry; NIGEL Farage has sparked uproar after adopting a BNP slogan as UKIP's election battle-cry.\b0\par\par\uc2 By EMILY ASHTON, Whitehall Correspondent   \par \uc2 473 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 17:29\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd.

Not changing it, keeping it forever."\par \par \uc2 In a rousing speech in Torquay, Devon, he said Britain had lost control of its borders thanks to the three main parties.\par \par \uc2 "The fact that in scores of our cities and market towns, this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognisable," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don't hear English spoken any more.\par \par \uc2 "This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."\par \par \uc2 He said he felt "awkward" on a recent train journey from central London into the suburbs because only foreign languages were being spoken.\par \par \uc2 "It wasn't until after we got past Grove Park that I could actually hear English being audibly spoken in the carriage," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Does that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage insisted that UKIP was "not anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 " but said new arrivals should be judged on both "quantity and quality".\par \par \uc2 Trying to shake off the party's "fruitcake" image, he insisted that UKIP "had changed" since 2010.\par \par \uc2 But he was left red-faced when a UKIP member asked a speaker at a fringe meeting: "How can you be both a Muslim and an English man?"\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile Mr Farage revealed that UKIP could do a deal with Labour - in return for an in-out EU referendum.\par \par \uc2 Sporty Khloe puts her Kurves on show He said: "I'd do a deal with the devil if it got this country the opportunity to win back its independence."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:e.ashton@the-sun.co.uk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 e.ashton@the-sun.co.uk}}}\par \par \uc2 Document THESUK0020140228ea2s005bq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Voices\par \b \uc2 Letters: Greed is still good in the amoral world of banking; These letters appear in the Saturday 1st March edition of the Independent\b0\par\par\uc2 Independent Voices   \par \uc2 1,528 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 18:19\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The financial sector has shown its true colours in the past few days. Its main driver is greed, with total absence of compassion, integrity or honour.\par \par \uc2 In the financial sector it is accepted that despite the business making losses, the top employees still get large bonuses.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 RBS was saved by money from the Government, ie money from the whole country, which could have otherwise been spent on projects of value for ordinary people.\par \par \uc2 Shady, immoral or illegal activities come to light and fines are imposed. Again, these fines come out of money originally provided by the general public.\par \par \uc2 RBS, still afloat only because of money from the public, is making huge losses. Despite this, a huge sum is put aside for \u8220\'20\'1Cbonuses".\par \par \uc2 Barclays\uc2  is still showing a loss and is laying off 7,000 lower-paid staff but at the same time is increasing bonuses by 10 per cent (to the highest-paid staff). The Government seems to think that restricting bonuses to once the annual salary is a punishment, even when the annual salary is \u163\'00\'A31m.\par \par \uc2 One of the factors that appears to have influenced Standard Life in looking at possibly moving out of Scotland is that, if the vote is yes, the tax regime might include increasing tax for the higher earners.\par \par \uc2 Even pension fund managers have been known to give themselves a large bonus, which is almost the same as stealing money which should have gone into funds to provide better pensions for those who pay in their hard-earned cash.\par \par \uc2 I have been told, by someone in the financial sector, that only by paying bonuses can they insure that people work hard. What an insult to the rest of society. Doctors, nurses, teachers, lecturers, farmers, fishermen, miners, police, builders, garbage collectors and almost everybody not in finance work hard without ever getting a bonus.\par \par \uc2 In no other business would senior staff take pay rises (and certainly not bonuses) if their business was making a loss. The financial sector is amoral.\par \par \uc2 Dr Evan Lloyd, Edinburgh\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The bonus pot at RBS of \u163\'00\'A3500m is beyond belief. Every year, when bailed-out banks pay themselves eye-watering sums, banker apologists in the media trot out the same well-worn clich\u233\'00\'E9. They say we need to pay this money to stop good staff leaving.\par \par \uc2 The bankers being paid bonuses at RBS have presided over six consecutive years of losses. Some bankers have been involved in the mis-selling of PPI and rigging the Libor rate, defrauding everyone. If these are the \u8220\'20\'1Cright" people, who knows what the wrong people would do.\par \par \uc2 Most working people have had years of wage cuts and austerity to pay for the bank bailout. Bankers now get bonuses simply for turning up to work.\par \par \uc2 The blame for the banking crisis lies at the door of Labour and Tory politicians who, after six years and a \u163\'00\'A31.2 trillion taxpayer bailout, are still allowing bankers to dictate the rules.\par \par \uc2 Alan Hinnrichs, Dundee\par \par \uc2 Let me get this straight\par \par \uc2 Despite reporting an \u163\'00\'A38.2bn pre-tax loss and despite huge losses for six consecutive years and despite the \u163\'00\'A345bn taxpayer bailout and despite the fact that shares are now worth 326p (and the taxpayer paid 500p per share) and despite the RBS chief executive eloquently describing the situation as \u8220\'20\'1CWe are too expensive, too bureaucratic and we need to change", the intention is to pay out \u163\'00\'A3576m in bonuses.\par \par \uc2 It all makes perfect sense. Does RBS stand for Right Bunch of Shysters?\par \par \uc2 Alex Taylor, London W5\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is not UK's big problem\par \par \uc2 Net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rose by 200,000 last year \u8211\'20\'13 where\u8217\'20\'19s the problem? We know that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is good for our economy and that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  make a substantial net contribution.\par \par \uc2 During the past year we have seen record falls in unemployment and our economy has been growing faster than those of other European nations. So where is the problem?\par \par \uc2 The problem seems to be that our infrastructure, particularly the \uc2 NHS\uc2 , hasn\u8217\'20\'19t grown to match the increase in our population. Even if net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  were reduced to zero, our infrastructure would still be under strain.\par \par \uc2 But we are a wealthy nation growing wealthier, in no small part due to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , so is it too simplistic to ask why we haven\u8217\'20\'19t been investing enough of this extra wealth in our infrastructure?\par \par \uc2 Francis Kirkham, Crediton, Devon\par \par \uc2 In 2009, Gordon Brown, following the publication of a poll showing \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was the biggest issue cited by defecting voters, and perhaps realising he was coming up to an election he was unlikely to win, upped the ante on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and launched an attack on the student visa system.\par \par \uc2 In what could be seen as a desperate game of one-upmanship, David Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s last bet was a promise to reduce net migration to under 100,000.\par \par \uc2 When decisions like this are taken by politicians to win elections, rather than in response to evidence or as a step to developing a sensible and achievable result and a long-lasting national strategy, we sadly end up with squabbling, recriminations and broken promises.\par \par \uc2 David Wilkins, London W12\par \par \uc2 We are certainly not alone\par \par \uc2 Your editorial (\u8220\'20\'1CEarth 2.0?", 28 February), commenting on the discovery of 715 new planets, concludes that the discovery of signs of life on such a planet \u8220\'20\'1Cwould raise the deepest philosophical questions about our own place in the universe" and \u8220\'20\'1Cwould mean that... in all likelihood, we are not alone. And that would change everything."\par \par \uc2 It is difficult to know what you mean. We are part of the universe, not separate from it. We are composed of elements that probably occur everywhere. We are products of the universe. We probably represent an example of an assemblage of molecules that in time would arise inevitably in certain conditions. And we are not alone \u8211\'20\'13 look at the myriad life forms on Earth.\par \par \uc2 Newton\u8217\'20\'19s contribution to the Enlightenment was the demonstration that the Earth is not unique, and that the same physical laws apply elsewhere, perhaps everywhere, in the universe. So let us go another step and recognise that the laws of life are probably universal too. Identification of another 715 planets, including warm damp ones, changes nothing.\par \par \uc2 Gavin P Vinson, London N10\par \par \uc2 You report on the 715 planets newly found \u8211\'20\'13 of which four are \u8220\'20\'1Cneither too hot nor too cold for liquid water, which we must assume to be essential ingredients for life". I do not profess to be an expert, but is it not conceivable for life forms to exist that do not depend on water nor on the other elements or compounds necessary for life on Earth?\par \par \uc2 I remember an episode of Star Trek where Captain Kirk and his cohorts arrived at a planet where the life forms were silicon-based and mistaken for canisters. In the words often attributed to Spock: \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s life, Jim, but not as we know it." When we talk of planets suitable to support life, we should qualify \u8220\'20\'1Clife" with those words.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Wright, Pinner, London\par \par \uc2 Time for rethink on how we treat animals\par \par \uc2 I found Bob Comis\u8217\'20\'19s disquiet on being a livestock farmer (\u8220\'20\'1CFarming confessional", 26 February) interesting, including all the hoops he\u8217\'20\'19s going through to justify what he does.\par \par \uc2 He has an idea that \u8220\'20\'1Cconscientious animal farming is necessary for a transition towards a vegan world". Surely, being part of an industry that produces 60 billion animals a year as a \u8220\'20\'1Ccrop" makes him part of the problem rather than part of the solution?\par \par \uc2 He feels he is betraying the 500 pigs he breeds, fattens and trucks to slaughter each year. As a vegan, I agree. I suggest he stops being part of an industry that uses animals as a product. His conscience will let him rest far easier and the vegan world he hopes for will come that tiny bit closer.\par \par \uc2 Sara Starkey, Tonbridge, Kent\par \par \uc2 With 5,000 animals being killed each year in European zoos (report, 27 February) it\u8217\'20\'19s obvious that the aim of zoos\u8217\'20\'19 breeding programmes is not to breed animals so they can be rehabilitated to the wild, but to breed them so they can be gawked at. If zoos were genuinely seeking to \u8220\'20\'1Csave" species they would be rehabilitating them to the wild, not killing them.\par \par \uc2 When circuses came under fire for imprisoning \u8220\'20\'1Cexotic" animals, zoos needed a reason to enable them to continue confining them. Hence the \u8220\'20\'1Cbreeding programmes" that they are quick to mention whenever a new baby rhino, lion or giraffe is born. The truth is that nothing attracts zoo patrons\u8211\'20\'13 and their money \u8211\'20\'13 like a new \u8220\'20\'1Cwild" baby.\par \par \uc2 If we genuinely want to conserve species we need to conserve their habitat.\par \par \uc2 Jenny Moxham, Monbulk, Victoria, Australia\par \par \uc2 The Scots won't have to switch off BBC\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CVote \u8216\'20\'18Yes\u8217\'20\'19 and you will lose the BBC, Scots are warned", you report (27 February). \u8220\'20\'1CVote \u8216\'20\'18Yes\u8217\'20\'19 and you will lose the BBC, unless you have a satellite dish, Scots are warned", surely?\par \par \uc2 Goff Sargent, Loughborough, Leicestershire\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140228ea2s005po\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has left Britain an "unrecognisable" country that many people would not want to leave to their children and grandchildren, Nigel Farage has said.\par \par \uc2 In one of his strongest attacks on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy, he said the arrival of migrants has some British people feeling that parts of the country are now alien to them.\par \par \uc2 The UK Independence Party leader said parts of the country had been "taken over" by foreigners and told how he caught a recent commuter train from London to Kent and had to wait for several stops before he heard English being spoken.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage's comments come after official figures published on Thursday showed a shock rise of more than 30 per cent or 58,000 over the past year in net migration to Britain to 212,000, mainly accounted by migrants from southern European countries.\par \par \uc2 In his keynote speech to Ukip's spring conference in Torquay on Friday, Mr Farage said: "It's ordinary folk, it's ordinary families that are paying the financial price. But what about the social price of this?\par \par \uc2 "The fact that in scores of our cities and market towns, this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognisable.\par \par \uc2 "Whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don't hear English spoken any more.\par \par \uc2 "This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."\par \par \uc2 Speaking to reporters later he said: "It's a genuine, legitimate, reasonable concern for people to say that imigration is acceptable but having whole areas taken over is difficult... it's happened on a scale that nobody could ever have imagined."\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader told how he went on a commuter train journey recently through south east London and did not hear anyone speaking English, leaving him feeling "awkward" and "uncomfortable".\par \par \uc2 He said: "Do I think parts of Britain are a foreign land? I got the train the other night, it was rush hour, from Charing Cross.\par \par \uc2 "It was a stopper going out and we stopped at London Bridge, New Cross, Hither Green, it was not til we got past Grove Park that I could hear English being audibly spoken in the carriage.\par \par \uc2 "Does that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes it does. I wonder what is really going on. I am saying that and I am sure that is a view that will be reflected by three quarters of the population, perhaps even more."\par \par \uc2 He added: "I'm not saying that people on trains should be forced to speak English. That's a bloody stupid question.\par \par \uc2 "What I am saying is we now have nearly 10 per cent of our schools in this country where English is not the primary language of the homes those children come from."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage warned that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  had done damage to "cohesion" in British society.\par \par \uc2 He said: "So the answer is, I don't feel very comfortable in that situation and I don't think the majority of British people do.\par \par \uc2 "It doesn't mean I'm against anybody of different backgrounds or different cultures - far from it. I want us to have a sensible, open-minded \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy.\par \par \uc2 "But I think that what we've got, or what we've had, certainly, and what we continue to have when it comes to the EU is just wholly irresponsible.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's done great damage to the cohesion of our society and the well-being of working people in this country."\par \par \uc2 He also defended Ukip members against accusations that they are eccentric, insisting that they merely proved Ukip represented "a broadly based body of public opinion".\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140228ea2s005se\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Rupert Soames\uc2  knows more than most about disaster zones, having spent the past 11 years pitching up at them with \uc2 Aggreko\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s temporary power equipment.\par \par \uc2 So, in many respects, he is ideally qualified for the top job at \uc2 Serco\uc2 , the outsourcing group that has been lurching from one calamity to another ever since it was fingered by the Ministry of Justice for overcharging on criminal tagging contracts.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Serious Fraud Office\uc2  inquiry, an exodus of senior staff \u8211\'20\'13 including former chief executive \uc2 Chris Hyman\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 and two profits warnings in three months are just the highlights of the corporate earthquake that over the past year has seen \u163\'00\'A31.4bn go AWOL from the group\u8217\'20\'19s market value. Well, at least until Friday, when the news that Soames was on his way restored \u163\'00\'A3250m.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s easy to see why \uc2 Serco\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s investors were so delighted \u8211\'20\'13 and why \uc2 Aggreko\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s shares fell by more than 4pc. In his shift at \uc2 Aggreko\uc2 , he put the share price up 12 times, even allowing for a pretty sketchy past year, given his usual standards.\par \par \uc2 Amusing and with a choice turn of phrase \u8211\'20\'13 Friday\u8217\'20\'19s offering, \u8220\'20\'1CCEOs are a bit like uranium. They have a definite half-life and if they stay around too long, they can decay into something quite toxic" was classic Soames \u8211\'20\'13 he has the right people skills for a 120,000-strong organisation that has been beaten up by politicians and is in desperate need of leadership.\par \par \uc2 As he proved with his recent intervention over the Scottish independence row, Soames is not one of those chief executives who is afraid to raise his head above the parapet. He thinks the idea of breaking up the United Kingdom is bonkers and he said so.\par \par \uc2 As befits the grandson of \uc2 Sir Winston Churchill\uc2 , he won\u8217\'20\'19t be cowed by grandstanding politicians \u8211\'20\'13 an important trait for a company that relies on governments at home and abroad for 80pc of its work. Indeed, the Churchill heritage should open doors abroad.\par \par \uc2 Soames clearly thinks that \uc2 Serco\uc2  is a turnaround waiting to happen \u8211\'20\'13 and his timing looks cute. But there is also no underestimating the job that awaits him. Chairman \uc2 Alastair Lyons\uc2  bridles at the suggestion that the group is little more than a holding company for 800 contracts \u8211\'20\'13 but there\u8217\'20\'19s no question that \uc2 Serco\uc2  has lost its reputation for trouble-free, cohesive service.\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s also the small matter of around 15pc of the company\u8217\'20\'19s revenue base coming up for grabs, with looming re-bids for the Northern Rail and \uc2 Docklands Light Railway\uc2  franchises in the UK and an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  contract in Australia.\par \par \uc2 Soames got off to a flier on Friday. But he has seen enough disaster zones to know that restoring power takes time.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140301ea2s000gq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Europe: \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  can\u8217\'20\'19t match Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s simple message; What does not appear to be on offer is the return of the sovereignty that the UK ceded under the European Communities Act in 1972\b0\par\par\uc2 By Telegraph View   \par \uc2 534 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 20:59\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 There must be times when \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  envies Nigel Farage. The simplicity of the Ukip leader\u8217\'20\'19s message obviates any need for subtlety or nuance. His position is easy to articulate: he wants Britain to leave the EU \u8211\'20\'13 no ifs nor buts. Mr Cameron does not want to leave, but he must none the less give the impression that the UK will only stay in if the institution is radically reformed to meet British concerns about the way it is run. He needs to do this both to win back Tories who have defected to Ukip, and to appease many of his backbenchers who want out of the EU.\par \par \uc2 This week\u8217\'20\'19s events have made Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s task far easier than the Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s. The visit to London on Thursday of Angela Merkel was not a fatal blow to Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s hopes of achieving some sort of renegotiated package. But it gave us a much clearer idea of what might be achievable \u8211\'20\'13 with the support of the big players in the EU \u8211\'20\'13 and what is fanciful.\par \par \uc2 The first thing that is apparent is that while a deal of some sort is certainly attainable, it will necessarily embrace the entire institution, and not be for the UK alone. As for what it might contain, Mrs Merkel said that, while the free movement of people is sacrosanct, its implementation should be reformed to prevent the abuse of welfare systems. The Dutch, meanwhile, have produced a number of ideas for reinforcing the notion of \u8220\'20\'1Csubsidiarity", whereby more decisions are taken by nation states and limited powers of veto are given to national parliaments through a \u8220\'20\'1Cred card" system should one third of them object to a particular proposal. These are practical measures that could be the foundation for a better-run Europe, in which the wings of the Brussels bureaucracy are clipped.\par \par \uc2 What does not appear to be on offer, however, is the return of the sovereignty that the UK ceded under the European Communities Act in 1972. And the danger for Mr Cameron is that he has sometimes given the impression not just that this is the case, but that we will somehow be able to run our affairs on a different basis to the rest of the EU. The risk is that he will raise expectations that will inevitably be dashed.\par \par \uc2 None of this will concern Mr Farage, who at Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s spring conference in Torquay yesterday made \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  his central campaigning issue for the European parliament elections, under the slogan \u8220\'20\'1CLove Britain". Again, his message was clear: you cannot control your own borders and remain a member of the EU, a fact exemplified by the recent leap in net migration. Ukip is aiming to top the poll in May \u8211\'20\'13 an outcome that would cause panic at Westminster. Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s ability to stop it happening does not look any greater at the end of the week than it did at the start.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140301ea2s000mc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Four First World War artists who defined the conflict; Works by Wyndham Lewis, Otto Dix, Paul Nash and David Bomberg helped define the Great War, representing the challenging landscapes and the voices of the soldiers who would never return\b0\par\par\uc2 955 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 20:58\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014.

The Somme alone saw more writers take part than any other battle in history, including Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, JRR Tolkien and Edmund Blunden. There, and on other fighting fronts, a new breed of well-educated soldier vividly chronicled their first-hand experiences through words, art and music.\par \par \uc2 Some were killed in action, bright lights of their generation such as the composer George Butterworth \u8211\'20\'13 another Somme casualty \u8211\'20\'13 whose creative promise would never be fulfilled. The \u8220\'20\'1Cluckier" ones were left forever with a survivor\u8217\'20\'19s guilt that darkly permeated their future work. All leave an invaluable legacy, whether through poetry, memoirs, fiction or art, that helps future generations to understand the reality of war. Here, Patrick Bishop selects four artists, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-seven/10667636/first-world-war-composers-notable.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 composers}}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-seven/10667766/first-world-war-writers-defining.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 writers}}}\uc2  (and their key works) who experienced the conflict first-hand and whose works have not only come to define the war; they changed what came after.\par \par \uc2 WYNDHAM LEWIS: A BATTERY SHELLED (1919)\par \par \uc2 Wyndham Lewis perhaps knew more than any of his artistic contemporaries about the business of war.\par \par \uc2 He was in his thirties when the conflict began; and had already established himself as a leading light of the avant garde as the founder of the cubism-inspired Vorticist school and the author of its short-lived but hugely influential journal, Blast.\par \par \uc2 As an gunnery officer, he was intimately engaged in the artillery duels that did most of the killing on the Western Front. As well as commanding a battery, he acted as spotter, operating from exposed forward observation posts to call down fire on the enemy.\par \par \uc2 A Battery Shelled (above) is a mysterious construct. A group of soldiers, one of them apparently Lewis, look out with seeming indifference over a sterile landscape of bunkers and geometric trench lines peopled by robotic stick men.\par \par \uc2 Vorticism did not survive the war and subsequently Lewis applied his questing energy to writing and criticism, much of it contentious.\par \par \uc2 OTTO DIX: TRENCH WARFARE (1932)\par \par \uc2 Dix was a 23-year-old art student in Dresden when the war broke out and he enlisted enthusiastically in the German Army. He fought as a machine-gunner on the Eastern and Western fronts, took part in the Battle of the Somme, won the Iron Cross and left the trenches only after being shot in the neck a few months before hostilities ended. His experiences were to haunt him for the rest of his life and inform some of his darkest and most brilliant work. The results are exemplified by his 1932 painting Trench Warfare (below), whose macabre imagery and charnel-house palette evoke a medieval atmosphere of suffering and evil. Dix was determined to confront the public with the reality of the war, but his honesty was unwelcome and the picture caused an outcry when first shown in Cologne. The \u8220\'20\'1Cunpatriotic" message of pointlessness was not lost on the Nazis, who included it in their 1937 exhibition of degenerate art.\par \par \uc2 PAUL NASH: WE ARE MAKING A NEW WORLD (1918)\par \par \uc2 No human figure inhabits this 1918 landscape (left). Nash seems to be saying that they are all gone, subsumed in the churned, polluted earth, stagnant water and shattered tree stumps, which the rising sun will never restore to life.\par \par \uc2 Nash was a public schoolboy, the son of a successful London lawyer. In 1914 he was at the Slade School of Art, one of a brilliant batch of students that included Stanley Spencer, Ben Nicholson and CRW Nevinson. He volunteered first for the Artists Rifles and arrived as a subaltern on the Western Front in February 1917. He was sent home after injuring himself in an accident but returned that autumn as an official war artist. His work did little to popularise the cause. As he declared in a letter to his wife, he was \u8220\'20\'1Cno longer an artist, interested and curious", there to observe and record, but a \u8220\'20\'1Cmessenger" bent on bearing witness to the horrors of trench life. He succeeded triumphantly. Over the years, the flat colours and bold shapes of his wartime paintings have embedded themselves in our consciousness. When the next war broke out, Nash served once again as an official artist, creating images that are perhaps less bleak but equally unforgettable.\par \par \uc2 DAVID BOMBERG: SAPPERS AT WORK (1918-19)\par \par \uc2 Bomberg was the son of working-class Polish- Jewish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  parents and one of the most precocious talents of his generation. He was another product of the prewar Slade but left after disagreements with the surgeon-turned-teacher Henry Tonks, the school\u8217\'20\'19s presiding genius who disapproved of his avantgarde approach. Bomberg drew inspiration from cubism, futurism and Vorticism, employing an angular, machine-age aesthetic.\par \par \uc2 He joined the Royal Engineers in 1915 and his first-hand experience of the most mechanised war in history was to have a profound effect on his artistic development. By the time he painted this picture of Canadian tunnellers burrowing under Hill 50 at Saint Eloi, south east of Ypres, he was moving back to the more naturalistic style that he would employ for the rest of his working life.\par \par \uc2 Bomberg lost his brother and his friend, the poet Isaac Rosenberg, to the war. His subsequent preoccupation with the colours and shapes of nature can be seen as a response to his own harrowing experiences.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-seven/10667766/first-world-war-writers-defining.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 READ: Four First World War writers who defined the conflict >>}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-seven/10667636/first-world-war-composers-notable.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 READ: Four First World War composers who defined the conflict >>}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140301ea2s000md\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 'I got it wrong on Paedophile Information Exchange': Patricia Hewitt finally apologises over group's links to \uc2 National Council for Civil Liberties\uc2  when she was its boss\b0\par\par\uc2 MICHAEL SEAMARK and MARK DUELL   \par \uc2 1,245 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 00:29\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

\par \uc2 * 65-year-old adds that NCCL was 'naive and wrong' over links with PIE\par \par \uc2 Former Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt finally apologised last night over the shocking links between the \uc2 National Council for Civil Liberties\uc2  and the vile paedophile group that campaigned to legalise sex with children.\par \par \uc2 She said the NCCL was \u8216\'20\'18naive and wrong\u8217\'20\'19 in dealings with the Paedophile Information Exchange and conceded: \u8216\'20\'18As\u160\'00\'A0 General Secretary then, I take responsibility for the mistakes we made.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I got it wrong on PIE and I apologise for having done so.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The ex-Cabinet minister had remained silent since the Mail revealed the extraordinary connections between the NCCL and the predatory paedophile group, who wanted the age of consent to be cut to just four.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this week Labour\u8217\'20\'19s deputy leader Harriet Harman, the NCCL\u8217\'20\'19s former legal officer, belatedly expressed \u8216\'20\'18regret\u8217\'20\'19 but refused to apologise over links between the left-wing pressure group and PIE.\par \par \uc2 Miss Harman maintained she had nothing to apologise for and dismissed the Mail revelations as a \u8216\'20\'18politically-motivated smear campaign\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, Miss Hewitt \u8211\'20\'13 general secretary when PIE was allowed to \u8216\'20\'18affiliate\u8217\'20\'19 with the NCCL \u8211\'20\'13 said she took responsibility for the mistakes that had been made.\par \par \uc2 Miss Hewitt, who claimed she had been away for the past 12 days while the controversy raged, said any suggestion that she had condoned or supported the \u8216\'20\'18vile crimes\u8217\'20\'19 of child abusers was completely untrue.\par \par \uc2 But she acknowledged that she should have done more to protect the integrity of the NCCL from the activities of PIE.\par \par \uc2 Police are now investigating PIE as part of the Operation Fernbridge child sex inquiry, launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.\par \par \uc2 DAILY MAIL COMMENT\par \par \uc2 Yes, it was too long in coming, but Patricia Hewitt has at least had the decency to apologise for offering succour to a group of vile paedophiles while in charge of the \uc2 National Council for Civil Liberties\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Admitting to being \u8216\'20\'18na\u239\'00\'EFve\u8217\'20\'19 and \u8216\'20\'18wrong\u8217\'20\'19, the ex-Labour Cabinet minister says she takes \u8216\'20\'18full responsibility\u8217\'20\'19 for the \u8216\'20\'18mistakes we made\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 What a shaming contrast with her friend and NCCL sidekick Harriet Harman, who managed only a grudging expression of \u8216\'20\'18regret\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Like so many on the Left, she holds the arrogant, invincible conviction that she can never ever be wrong \u8211\'20\'13 no matter how damning the evidence.\par \par \uc2 A senior source said there was evidence PIE members were abusing children \u8216\'20\'18on an industrial scale\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 The Home Office is also looking into shocking claims that the Labour government of the 1970s may have helped finance the paedophile group.\par \par \uc2 Miss Hewitt said: \u8216\'20\'18NCCL in the 1970s, along with many others, was naive and wrong to accept PIE\u8217\'20\'19s claim to be a \u8220\'20\'1Ccampaigning and counselling organisation" that \u8220\'20\'1Cdoes not promote unlawful acts".\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I should have urged the executive committee to take stronger measures to protect NCCL\u8217\'20\'19s integrity from the activities of PIE members and sympathisers and I deeply regret not having done so.\u8217\'20\'19\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 In particular, she said that PIE leader Tom O\u8217\'20\'19Carroll should never have been allowed to join the NCCL\u8217\'20\'19s gay rights sub-committee.\par \par \uc2 Miss Hewitt, Miss Harman and her MP husband Jack Dromey all held key roles in the NCCL in the 1970s and 1980s when strong links were forged with PIE.\par \par \uc2 A Mail investigation discovered that Miss Hewitt described PIE in glowing terms and revealed that the NCCL lobbied parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten \u8211\'20\'13 if the child consented and \u8216\'20\'18understood the nature of the act\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 The NCCL also called for incest to be legalised in what one MP dubbed a \u8216\'20\'18Lolita\u8217\'20\'19s charter\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Miss Hewitt \u8211\'20\'13 who was at the helm of the NCCL from 1974 to 1983 \u8211\'20\'13 said that the proposal by the NCCL to reduce the age of consent had not been hers, although she admitted that it had been the policy of the organisation and the executive committee.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I do not support reducing the\u160\'00\'A0 age of consent or legalising incest,\u8217\'20\'19 she said.\par \par \uc2 'As the NCCL archives demonstrate, I consistently distinguished between consenting relationships between homosexual men, on the one hand, and the abuse of children on the other.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 She defended the roles played by Miss Harman and her husband \u8211\'20\'13 who is also a Labour frontbencher \u8211\'20\'13 when they were prominent figures in the NCCL.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18When Jack Dromey, as NCCL chairman in 1976, vigorously opposed PIE at the NCCL AGM, he did so with the full support of the executive committee and myself as general secretary,\u8217\'20\'19 she said.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Harriet did not join the NCCL staff until 1978. She was one of two legal officers, neither of whom was a member of the executive committee.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Miss Hewitt said that she was proud of the achievements of\u160\'00\'A0 the NCCL during her time as\u160\'00\'A0 general secretary.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18NCCL in the 1970s played a leading role in anti-discrimination and equality campaigns. We helped to secure the Sex Discrimination Act, anonymity for rape victims and an end to discriminatory \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rules against British women with a foreign husband. We also built support for equalising the age of consent for homosexual men \u8211\'20\'13 a change eventually made in 1998,\u8217\'20\'19 she said.\par \par \uc2 'As General Secretary then, I take responsibility for the mistakes we made'\par \par \uc2 Patricia Hewitt\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I am proud of the contribution NCCL made to these and other important reforms during my time as general secretary.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 She added: \u8216\'20\'18Although the evil of child sexual abuse is now properly recognised, as a society we still have a long way to go in protecting children, tackling the sexualisation of girls and supporting the survivors of sexual abuse.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I hope the lessons that are being learnt from the mistakes of the 1970s will contribute to those goals.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Labour leader Ed Miliband publicly defended Miss Harman on Monday.\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8216\'20\'18Harriet Harman is somebody of huge decency and integrity. I have known her for 20 years. I do not set any store by these allegations.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I know she has a long and proud record of being on the right side of all of these issues.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The apology by Miss Hewitt, who nowadays has a lucrative seat as a non-executive director on the board of BT, earning \u163\'00\'A3160,000 a year for a part-time job, came as more evidence emerged linking her with PIE.\par \par \uc2 Archive documents revealed letters she exchanged with its chairman Keith Hose in 1975.\par \par \uc2 Hose wrote to the NCCL general secretary \u8211\'20\'13 on PIE notepaper which features a logo of two young children sitting bare-legged on a rock \u8211\'20\'13 asking her to consider PIE\u8217\'20\'19s view in its policy on ages of consent.\par \par \uc2 Miss Hewitt wrote back to the paedophile group saying: \u8216\'20\'18Dear Keith, We have found your evidence... most helpful and I think it has certainly been taken into account by the people preparing our evidence.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 A memo from 1978 also emerged in which she said the NCCL would be prepared to offer legal advice to adults who wanted to have sex with 14-year-olds.\par \par \uc2 The Mail yesterday reported that the NCCL placed a recruitment advert for new members in PIE\u8217\'20\'19s house magazine and told how Miss Hewitt shared a conference platform with O\u8217\'20\'19Carroll in 1977.\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140228ea2s001p6\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 RightMinds\par \b \uc2 TOM UTLEY: Call me loopy but there's something mystical about a UK passport.

I am astonished and more than a little appalled.\par \par \uc2 Bonkers\par \par \uc2 I must confess that it had passed me by (or, more likely, I\u8217\'20\'19d just forgotten) that such a scheme existed. But it seems we\u8217\'20\'19ve been selling these visas, which can lead automatically to full citizenship for those who want it, ever since John Major\u8217\'20\'19s administration approved the idea in 1994.\par \par \uc2 Let me say at once that I can well understand why \uc2 the Migration Advisory Committee\uc2  (MAC) believes the system needs changing. For the deal as it stands appears to be extraordinarily generous to the non-EU plutocrats who take advantage of it, while offering much less to the British taxpayer than it surely could.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, it is misleading to suggest the visas cost these Russian oligarchs and Chinese zillionaires a penny, since all they are required to do is invest a minimum \u163\'00\'A31\u8201\'20\'09million in UK Treasury bonds \u8212\'20\'14 and since we have to shell out interest on these loans, there\u8217\'20\'19s a sense in which we are paying them to enjoy what Britain has to offer.\par \par \uc2 Under the current rules, that \u163\'00\'A31\u8201\'20\'09million will secure them permanent residency after five years, when they will be free to sell their gilts. But if they want to speed things up a bit, \u163\'00\'A35\u8201\'20\'09\u8201\'20\'09million will allow them to stay indefinitely after three years and \u163\'00\'A310\u8201\'20\'09\u8201\'20\'09\u8201\'20\'09\u8201\'20\'09\u8201\'20\'09\u8201\'20\'09million after only two.\par \par \uc2 Then it\u8217\'20\'19s just a 12-month wait until they become eligible for naturalisation as British citizens, when they have to take a bonkers test, answering such questions as: \u8216\'20\'18There is no place in British society for extremism or intolerance \u8212\'20\'14 true or false?\u8217\'20\'19 (Yes, that is one of the practice questions for the official Life In The UK Test \u8212\'20\'14 unless I\u8217\'20\'19ve fallen victim to an internet hoax).\par \par \uc2 From then until their dying day, they and their families can enjoy all the blessings bestowed upon us native Brits at birth, such as the rule of law, free and fair elections, excellent schools (for those who can afford them), a free Press (well, comparatively so, for the moment), wonderful shops and restaurants, uncorrupt officials, free healthcare, honest(ish) politicians, lovely weather, clean, uncrowded trains\u8201\'20\'09\u8230\'20\'26 All right, perhaps I\u8217\'20\'19m overselling it a bit.\par \par \uc2 Enough to say that British citizenship still has an awful lot of attractions to your average Russian, Chinese or Kazakhstani billionaire \u8212\'20\'14 particularly if things are getting hot for him at home.\par \par \uc2 So no wonder MAC chairman Sir David Metcalf believes we could squeeze more out of them in return for admitting them to Shakespeare\u8217\'20\'19s \u8216\'20\'18happy breed of men\u8217\'20\'19, awarding them Cecil Rhodes\u8217\'20\'19s \u8216\'20\'18first prize in the lottery of life\u8217\'20\'19 and allowing them to bag all our best houses and clog up the traffic with their stretch limos.\par \par \uc2 Yes, they contribute something to our economy by buying expensive goods and the priciest seats at the Royal Opera House.\par \par \uc2 Some of the 1,647 who have taken advantage of the scheme since 2008, when the Government belatedly started counting them, may even pay taxes like you and me \u8212\'20\'14 though I suspect most wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t dream of doing anything so silly and have accountants sharp enough to avoid the necessity.\par \par \uc2 Corruption\par \par \uc2 But as Sir David says, they would surely be prepared to pay more for the opportunity to join the ranks of the Queen\u8217\'20\'19s subjects. Hence his proposal that not only should we double the \u163\'00\'A31\u8201\'20\'09\u8201\'20\'09million minimum investment required, which hasn\u8217\'20\'19t been raised since the scheme began 20 years ago.\par \par \uc2 He suggests we should also test the market by auctioning off 100 or so visas, with a reserve price of perhaps \u163\'00\'A32.5\u8201\'20\'09\u8201\'20\'09million.\par \par \uc2 Under his plan, the first \u163\'00\'A32\u8201\'20\'09\u8201\'20\'09million of the proceeds would have to be invested in gilts, infrastructure bonds or venture capital, while the surplus would go into a fund for good causes.\par \par \uc2 All right, the sale he proposes wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be quite as I described in my opening paragraphs. Instead, he would invite applicants to send in sealed bids, without ever revealing how much the winner paid (which would surely offer huge scope for corruption, while offering m\u8217\'20\'19learned friends openings for lucrative legal challenges).\par \par \uc2 But the effect would be precisely the same. We would be selling British nationality for hard cash. And the idea of it fills me with distaste.\par \par \uc2 Yes, I know we\u8217\'20\'19re hideously in debt. And I can see the force of the argument that since we throw open our borders to all and sundry from the EU (just look at yesterday\u8217\'20\'19s release of rocketing migration figures), a few billionaires from outside it won\u8217\'20\'19t make much difference. So why not milk them?\par \par \uc2 But in my book, treating nationality as a saleable commodity, to be auctioned to the highest bidder, is tacky, demeaning and just plain wrong. Quite as wrong, in fact, as selling the right to vote (which is included in the package).\par \par \uc2 This sort of thing may be thought all right in banana republics or countries such as Malta, which offers a full EU passport for \u163\'00\'A3500,000 to anyone prepared to live there for a year. But surely it is far beneath the dignity of the United Kingdom.\par \par \uc2 At the risk of sounding loopy, I would say there is something almost mystical about nationality. It\u8217\'20\'19s a covenant between us \u8212\'20\'14 a bond second in strength only to our family\u160\'00\'A0ties.\par \par \uc2 It is this intangible blessing that gives us a wholly irrational surge of joy when a young woman we\u8217\'20\'19ve never heard of, but who happens to be British, hurtles down the Sochi ice on a tea-tray and wins a gold.\par \par \uc2 Devalue\par \par \uc2 Would you feel the same buzz if Lizzy Yarnold had bought her British citizenship at auction? I don\u8217\'20\'19t think I would. It\u8217\'20\'19s an asset beyond price \u8212\'20\'14 and trading it for money can only devalue it.\par \par \uc2 Nor do I think it any part of the business of government to sell official documentation for anything more than an administration fee. Obviously, it\u8217\'20\'19s fine to sell tradable assets, such as oil exploration rights or broadband licences. But you and I are not allowed to sell our British passports. It just feels wrong to me that ministers should feel that they can.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps, I really should see a shrink, but I thought the DVLA was behaving improperly when it began selling personalised car number-plates for huge mark-ups on the standard registration fee.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s a Government agency, for heaven\u8217\'20\'19s sake, employed simply to issue plates and make a note of who owns which vehicle.\par \par \uc2 I couldn\u8217\'20\'19t help wondering what business it was of a branch of the state bureaucracy to set up as a novelty gift shop. But if that was tawdry, how much more so is the plan to sell British nationality to any Xiaoping or Igor with deep enough pockets?\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, what next? An auction of letters from the Attorney General, granting immunity from prosecution to fraudsters and blood-soaked terrorists?\par \par \uc2 Now, that could be a very nice little earner.

And, indeed, she was able to help him out by saying that she, too, was worried about \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  using EU freedom of movement to come to Germany and milk its benefits system.\par \par \uc2 But vitally important though the question of controlling our own borders is, it is far from being the only crucial issue at stake.\par \par \uc2 And Mrs Merkel made it quite clear that any developments in Europe will take place within existing, unreformed, institutions.\par \par \uc2 T\u160\'00\'A0 o judge from rhetoric within her government about solving the continuing problems in the eurozone, the prevailing German view is that only by countries\u8217\'20\'19 further sacrifices of sovereignty and a unified approach to economic policies will the most deep-seated problems be ironed out.\par \par \uc2 Although many Germans fear \u8212\'20\'14 not least for historical reasons \u8212\'20\'14 being seen as imposing their will on other countries, running the eurozone efficiently without controlling the taxation and spending policies of the countries within it will prove impossible.\par \par \uc2 For when it comes to dealing with widely disparate national economies, one size does not fit all.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Merkel made two further, telling points before she went for tea with the Queen at Buckingham Palace.\par \par \uc2 The first was that changes could only be made to EU treaties if all 28 countries in the Union agree. There is already resentment, particularly in France, at some of the opt-outs enjoyed by Britain (such as exclusion from the euro), and it is hard to imagine all 27 other countries lining up to give us any more concessions.\par \par \uc2 This is particularly true if they could be seriously disadvantaged by them, as would be the case with Eastern European nations whose citizens wish to retain freedom of entry to the UK.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Merkel is a formidable stateswoman who deserves respect for her achievements on behalf of Germany and for sticking to her guns to get what she wants. She is also rare in European politics in being a head of government who is neither corrupt nor incompetent.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron is right to cultivate good relations with her. Even if very little progress in Europe is possible with her, nothing would be possible without her.\par \par \uc2 But if he thinks this wily German is going to provide him with a promise of serious EU reform that he can take into the election campaign next year, and then use to persuade the electorate to vote \u8216\'20\'18yes\u8217\'20\'19 in a referendum in 2017, he is utterly deluding himself.\par \par \uc2 It is not the first time he has made such a mistake.\par \par \uc2 Running for election as Tory leader in 2005, he promised immediate withdrawal of Conservative MEPs from the ultra-federalist European People\u8217\'20\'19s Party (the alliance of mainstream Centre-Right parties at Brussels).\par \par \uc2 It turned out this could not happen until the next European elections, which meant waiting nearly four years.\par \par \uc2 He then, as Leader of the Opposition, promised to repeal the unpopular Lisbon Treaty, which Gordon Brown signed in 2007, ceding yet more sovereignty to Brussels.\par \par \uc2 However, Mr Cameron was still making this claim long after senior diplomats had advised him and his foreign affairs spokesman, William Hague, that repeal was not possible because of how the treaty had been incorporated into law. To repeal it through the \uc2 British Parliament\uc2  would entail repealing all the legislation that bound us into the EU in the first place.\par \par \uc2 N\u160\'00\'A0 ow, desperate to appease backbenchers who want more urgent action on reform of the EU, and to ward off the relentless march of Ukip, he pinned his hopes on Mrs Merkel agreeing not just to support the sort of \u8216\'20\'18fundamental\u8217\'20\'19 renegotiation he wants to put before the British people, but also to use her influence to persuade the other member states to go along with it.\par \par \uc2 This was the real reason the German head of government received the sort of welcome yesterday that would normally be reserved for a head of state.\par \par \uc2 With no renegotiation worthy of the name in prospect, Mr Cameron has a grave problem.\par \par \uc2 He set the date of late 2017 for a referendum, he claimed, because it would allow time for such a renegotiation, and for its results to be placed before the electorate. He also did not want a referendum before then because of the serious possibility of the vote going, from his point of view, the wrong way, and the public voting to leave the EU.\par \par \uc2 But unless Mrs Merkel should radically change her mind, the excuse for delaying the vote has disappeared.\par \par \uc2 It may be that Mr Cameron genuinely thought Germany, and the rest of Europe, would pay any price to keep the UK inside the tent. If so, he was wrong about that, too, because Mrs Merkel said yesterday there was no such blank cheque.\par \par \uc2 As she also said, with a humility that was worthy of respect, she came to London on the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War, and the 75th anniversary of Hitler\u8217\'20\'19s war.\par \par \uc2 The haunting memories of both, and the enormous crimes against humanity perpetrated by Germans, impels\u160\'00\'A0 her to seek a Europe so united that, as she said, it is unthinkable that two countries could go to war with each other.\par \par \uc2 Germany\u8217\'20\'19s main collaborator, ever since 1950, has been France. But France is now a socialist basket case, its international credibility shot to pieces, and relations between Mrs Merkel and its president, Francois Hollande, are dire.\par \par \uc2 That is undoubtedly part of the reason why she is keen to maintain such good relations with Britain, at least until France comes under better management. But she will not compromise herself solely to maintain those relations.\par \par \uc2 However brave David Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s face yesterday, this key part of his European strategy is in tatters. He may get crumbs from the table,\u160\'00\'A0 but to hope for anything more is a fantasy.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately for him, Tory backbenchers understand this, and Ukip will ruthlessly exploit such weakness.\par \par \uc2 Holding his party together, particularly after the dismal European election results that the Tories now expect in May, is about to become very much more difficult.\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140228ea2s0026c\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Arizona lawmaker accused of racism after racially-charged roast of Sheriff Joe Arpaio\b0\par\par\uc2 RYAN GORMAN   \par \uc2 644 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par 02:48\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

I want us to be the people who say we are proud of our country.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Attacking the political establishment which he says dominates the other parties, he added: \u8216\'20\'18Don\u8217\'20\'19t get mad, get even.

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 CALL ME LOOPY, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING MYSTICAL ABOUT A UK PASSPORT. FLOGGING THEM TO OLIGARCHS JUST FEELS TAWDRY\b0\par\par\uc2 BY TOM ULTEY   \par \uc2 1,377 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 SOTHEBY'S\uc2 , Moscow, some time in the near future: 'Next we come to lot number 132. A lovely little item, this one, which we're selling on the instructions of Her Majesty's Government in London.\par \par \uc2 'Just the thing to brighten up the lives of the missus and the little ones, and to shake off those infuriating fraud investigators.\par \par \uc2 'Now, who will start the bidding for a guaranteed fast-track to permanent residency rights in the UK, with the promise of British citizenship and passports for all the family to follow? Do I hear \u163\'00\'A32.5 million sterling? That's 150 million roubles to you, sir ...'\par \par \uc2 Of course, this is pure fantasy \u8212\'20\'14 for the moment. But I can't have been the only one who was astonished to read that something like it could soon become a reality.\par \par \uc2 Proposals from the Home Office's official \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  advisers aim to reform the so-called investor route by which millionaires can buy indefinite leave to remain in these islands. I am astonished and more than a little appalled.\par \par \uc2 Bonkers\par \par \uc2 I must confess that it had passed me by (or, more likely, I'd just forgotten) that such a scheme existed. But it seems we've been selling these visas, which can lead automatically to full citizenship for those who want it, ever since John Major's administration approved the idea in 1994.\par \par \uc2 Let me say at once that I can well understand why \uc2 the Migration Advisory Committee\uc2  (MAC) believes the system needs changing. For the deal as it stands appears to be extraordinarily generous to the non-EU plutocrats who take advantage of it, while offering much less to the British taxpayer than it surely could.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, it is misleading to suggest the visas cost these Russian oligarchs and Chinese zillionaires a penny, since all they are required to do is invest a minimum \u163\'00\'A31 million in UK Treasury bonds \u8212\'20\'14 and since we have to shell out interest on these loans, there's a sense in which we are paying them to enjoy what Britain has to offer.\par \par \uc2 Under the current rules, that \u163\'00\'A31 million will secure them permanent residency after five years, when they will be free to sell their gilts. But if they want to speed things up a bit, \u163\'00\'A35 million will allow them to stay indefinitely after three years and \u163\'00\'A310 million after only two.\par \par \uc2 Then it's just a 12-month wait until they become eligible for naturalisation as British citizens, when they have to take a bonkers test, answering such questions as: 'There is no place in British society for extremism or intolerance \u8212\'20\'14 true or false?' (Yes, that is one of the practice questions for the official Life In The UK Test \u8212\'20\'14 unless I've fallen victim to an internet hoax).\par \par \uc2 From then until their dying day, they and their families can enjoy all the blessings bestowed upon us native Brits at birth, such as the rule of law, free and fair elections, excellent schools (for those who can afford them), a free Press (well, comparatively so, for the moment), wonderful shops and restaurants, uncorrupt officials, free healthcare, honest(ish) politicians, lovely weather, clean, uncrowded trains ... All right, perhaps I'm overselling it a bit.\par \par \uc2 Enough to say that British citizenship still has an awful lot of attractions to your average Russian, Chinese or Kazakhstani billionaire \u8212\'20\'14 particularly if things are getting hot for him at home.\par \par \uc2 So no wonder MAC chairman Sir David Metcalf believes we could squeeze more out of them in return for admitting them to Shakespeare's 'happy breed of men', awarding them Cecil Rhodes's 'first prize in the lottery of life' and allowing them to bag all our best houses and clog up the traffic with their stretch limos.\par \par \uc2 Yes, they contribute something to our economy by buying expensive goods and the priciest seats at the Royal Opera House.\par \par \uc2 Some of the 1,647 who have taken advantage of the scheme since 2008, when the Government belatedly started counting them, may even pay taxes like you and me \u8212\'20\'14 though I suspect most wouldn't dream of doing anything so silly and have accountants sharp enough to avoid the necessity.\par \par \uc2 Corruption\par \par \uc2 But as Sir David says, they would surely be prepared to pay more for the opportunity to join the ranks of the Queen's subjects. Hence his proposal that not only should we double the \u163\'00\'A31 million minimum investment required, which hasn't been raised since the scheme began 20 years ago.\par \par \uc2 He suggests we should also test the market by auctioning off 100 or so visas, with a reserve price of perhaps \u163\'00\'A32.5 million.\par \par \uc2 Under his plan, the first \u163\'00\'A32 million of the proceeds would have to be invested in gilts, infrastructure bonds or venture capital, while the surplus would go into a fund for good causes.\par \par \uc2 All right, the sale he proposes wouldn't be quite as I described in my opening paragraphs. Instead, he would invite applicants to send in sealed bids, without ever revealing how much the winner paid (which would surely offer huge scope for corruption, while offering m'learned friends openings for lucrative legal challenges).\par \par \uc2 But the effect would be precisely the same. We would be selling British nationality for hard cash. And the idea of it fills me with distaste.\par \par \uc2 Yes, I know we're hideously in debt. And I can see the force of the argument that since we throw open our borders to all and sundry from the EU (just look at yesterday's release of rocketing migration figures), a few billionaires from outside it won't make much difference. So why not milk them?\par \par \uc2 But in my book, treating nationality as a saleable commodity, to be auctioned to the highest bidder, is tacky, demeaning and just plain wrong. Quite as wrong, in fact, as selling the right to vote (which is included in the package).\par \par \uc2 This sort of thing may be thought all right in banana republics or countries such as Malta, which offers a full EU passport for \u163\'00\'A3500,000 to anyone prepared to live there for a year. But surely it is far beneath the dignity of the United Kingdom.\par \par \uc2 At the risk of sounding loopy, I would say there is something almost mystical about nationality. It's a covenant between us \u8212\'20\'14 a bond second in strength only to our family\u160\'00\'A0ties.\par \par \uc2 It is this intangible blessing that gives us a wholly irrational surge of joy when a young woman we've never heard of, but who happens to be British, hurtles down the Sochi ice on a tea-tray and wins a gold.\par \par \uc2 Devalue\par \par \uc2 Would you feel the same buzz if Lizzy Yarnold had bought her British citizenship at auction? I don't think I would. It's an asset beyond price \u8212\'20\'14 and trading it for money can only devalue it.\par \par \uc2 Nor do I think it any part of the business of government to sell official documentation for anything more than an administration fee. Obviously, it's fine to sell tradable assets, such as oil exploration rights or broadband licences. But you and I are not allowed to sell our British passports. It just feels wrong to me that ministers should feel that they can.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps, I really should see a shrink, but I thought the DVLA was behaving improperly when it began selling personalised car number-plates for huge mark-ups on the standard registration fee.\par \par \uc2 It's a Government agency, for heaven's sake, employed simply to issue plates and make a note of who owns which vehicle.\par \par \uc2 I couldn't help wondering what business it was of a branch of the state bureaucracy to set up as a novelty gift shop. But if that was tawdry, how much more so is the plan to sell British nationality to any Xiaoping or Igor with deep enough pockets?\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, what next? An auction of letters from the Attorney General, granting immunity from prosecution to fraudsters and blood-soaked terrorists?\par \par \uc2 Now, that could be a very nice little earner. But I mustn't go putting ideas into politicians' heads.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140228ea2s0000m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

By contrast, the number of non-EU arrivals dropped by 25,000 in the same period.\par \par \uc2 The latest data from the \uc2 Office of National Statistics\uc2  give credence to fears that the UK's education exports are suffering as a result of the government's stringent \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  controls , since statisticians attributed the 25,000 fall to a drop in migrants from New Commonwealth countries coming to the UK to study.\par \par \uc2 But while potential students from India and Pakistan are being deterred from applying to study in the UK, there has been a significant increase in arrivals from Romania and Bulgaria. In total, 24,000 migrants arrived from these countries in the year to September 2013, nearly three times the 9,000 who arrived the previous year. About 70 per cent came to work and 30 per cent for education.\par \par \uc2 Data on national insurance registrations showed a rise of less than 30 per cent in the number of EU nationals seeking work in the UK, an increase of 97,000 in the year to December 2013.\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives promised before the last election to bring net migration down to fewer than 100,000 by 2015 but, despite early reductions, the overall figure is creeping towards the highs of 250,000 seen just after the coalition took over.\par \par \uc2 Responding to the data James Brokenshire, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, said he and his team were building an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system that was "fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants", while being "tough on those who abuse the system or flout the law".\par \par \uc2 "The government is ensuring that our controls on accessing benefits and services, including the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and social housing, are among the tightest in Europe," Mr Brokenshire said. "We cannot impose formal \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  controls on EU migrants, so we are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and seeking to address the factors that drive European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to Britain."\par \par \uc2 But Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, said the figures showed that the net migration target was "in tatters".\par \par \uc2 "David Cameron and Theresa May chose this target despite being warned that it would be counter-productive as it includes students who contribute to Britain but doesn't include illegal \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  which is very damaging," she said.\par \par \uc2 "These figures show the number of students is falling, while evidence shows illegal \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is getting worse. And now they are even failing against their chosen net migration target, too."\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage, Ukip leader, said the figures showed "just what a failure the government has been" on controlling \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Scott Blinder, director of Oxford university's Migration Observatory, described the release as "challenging news" for the government.\par \par \uc2 "The key changes in this report are to EU migration, an area over which \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy has less direct influence," Mr Blinder said. "This highlights the fact that the net migration target is not something that can be delivered purely through policy but relies on other trends as well."\par \par \uc2 Blog: migration statistics that only Ukip could love {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ft.com/offmessage"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 www.ft.com/offmessage}}}\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020140228ea2s0000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 COMMENT\par \b \uc2 Merkel will not banish Britain's EU demons\b0\par\par\uc2 By Philip Stephens   \par \uc2 944 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2014\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFT\par \uc2 USA Ed1\par 09\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Margaret Thatcher was right. Campaigning to keep Britain in the EU, the former Conservative leader declared that Europe opened windows on the world that would otherwise close with the end of empire. To protect and promote its interests around the globe, Britain needed an anchor of authority and influence on its own continent. That was 40 years ago. Nowadays, it falls to \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  , Germany's chancellor, to make the case for British engagement.\par \par \uc2 Thatcher's argument, offered to the House of Commons before the 1975 referendum on EU membership, is not heard often in today's Tory party. Hardline eurosceptics, who have wrenched control of policy from \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  's government, shake a fist at geopolitical realities. Unshackled from the EU, they imagine, their plucky island nation would be restored to its rightful role as a global power.\par \par \uc2 The impact of such delusion is already being felt. There was a small glimpse of this when Ukrainian protesters gathered in Kiev's Independence Square to overturn the government of Viktor Yanukovich.\par \par \uc2 A couple of decades ago, to the great credit of John Major's government, Britain was a powerful champion of the efforts to extend security and democracy eastward. Yet the efforts to mediate in Ukraine devolved to Germany, France and Poland. Britain stood on the margins. Such has been the extraordinary narrowing of strategic focus that Mr Cameron seems more anxious to lock out \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  workers from the former Communist bloc than to support Ukraine's claim to a European future.\par \par \uc2 Ms Merkel was feted this week with lunch in Downing Street, tea with the Queen at Buckingham Palace and a rare audience of both houses of parliament in between times. The contrast with the low-key reception for \uc2 Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Hollande\uc2  when the French president visited Britain a few weeks ago was no accident.\par \par \uc2 The German chancellor had been invited to make the case that her host has allowed to go by default. Mr Cameron well knows that she is an indispensable ally. His promise fundamentally to renegotiate the terms of British EU membership was never terribly credible. Without some rhetorical support from the continent's most powerful leader, it would be entirely threadbare.\par \par \uc2 This insight has not been lost on Ms Merkel. One senior German official has been heard to remark - only a little unkindly - that she has two European missions: the first to rescue the euro, and the second to save Mr Cameron from his own political miscalculation. The open question is whether he has the political courage to help himself.\par \par \uc2 The signs are not encouraging. The prime minister has widened the channel separating Britain from the continent by overturning 40 years of British European policy. Hitherto, even when governments stood aside from this or that EU project, they have insisted on a seat at the table. Mr Cameron leaves an empty chair.\par \par \uc2 He had hoped - naively - that the promise of a second referendum would turn the tide of Tory europhobia. The reverse has been true. Many sceptics demand changes in the terms of the relationship that they know can be achieved only through departure. The original sin, you hear them say, was the transfer of sovereignty in the treaty of Rome.\par \par \uc2 Ms Merkel's readiness to offer an eloquent counter-argument was not entirely altruistic. For Germany, the most important relationship in Europe will always be that with France. Without the Franco-German axis, the enterprise will founder.\par \par \uc2 Berlin, however, does not want an exclusive arrangement. It also looks for allies in the more freewheeling north of the continent. Britain is an obvious choice. Berlin worries too about Europe's standing in the world. Ministers close to Ms Merkel make a telling point: what would it do for European prestige if the EU lost one of its most important, albeit troublesome, members?\par \par \uc2 So Ms Merkel wants to be helpful. Between the lines of her speech you could read that she will back reforms that promote a more outward-looking, competitive union. Some of the rules on social policy can be revisited and brakes applied to EU intrusions into matters better left to national governments. Protections can be offered to those nations that remain outside the eurozone.\par \par \uc2 There are, however, limits. Ms Merkel will not accept changes to the treaties or exemptions for Britain that would jeopardise the essential fabric of the union. For his part, Mr Cameron dare not list his demands with any precision for fear of inviting his party's sceptics to dismiss them as inadequate.\par \par \uc2 So even as she asks Britain to stay, reprising Thatcher's arguments about influence in the wider world, the chancellor is making plans against the possibility it will leave. The demarche in Kiev was a sign of things to come: Poland has begun to look a natural substitute for Britain as Germany's northern ally.\par \par \uc2 There are lots of reasons why Britain has felt uncomfortable in the EU - why, in the phrase of Lord Patten, the former Tory minister and EU commissioner, it has never really "joined Europe". Political culture, geography and imperial history have all played their part.\par \par \uc2 However, what most infuriates those now dragging it towards the exit is the idea of membership of a club Britain does not lead. A US secretary of state got it right some years ago. Never underestimate, Edward Stettinius wrote to president Franklin Roosevelt during the second world war, the difficulty an Englishman faces in adjusting to a secondary role after so long seeing leadership as a national right. As they say in Europe, plus \u231\'00\'E7a change.\par \par \uc2 philip.stephens@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020140228ea2s0002q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Tory failure to cap \uc2 immigration\uc2  is an opportunity for a policy rethink\b0\par\par\uc2 Hugh Muir   \par \uc2 theguardian.com\par \uc2 860 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par \uc2 Guardian.co.uk\par \uc2 GRULTD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Guardian News & Media Limited. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Hugh Muir: First thoughts: The PM promised something he couldn't possibly deliver. Now he needs an honest conversation with the public\par \par \uc2 Is there anyone who wouldn't have paid good money to have been a fly on the wall in Downing Street over the past 24 hours? \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  doesn't seem to be a sweary type; he doesn't blowtorch underlings or kick the copying machines in the style of \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 but there will have been ructions on receipt of those latest migration figures from the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2 . Net migration up 30% in the past year when, after all the breast beating and from all the promises Cameron made to the electorate, it should have gone down.\par \par \uc2 That was the battleground for the next election. Nothing else had the potential to address the Labour poll lead that has been so long out of reach. Cameron put all of his betting chips on what seemed to be the party's trump card: the "Vote for us, we're tough on migration and tough on migrants" strategy. The bet was lost; the result not even close. Net migration has hit 212,000 and gone is the hope of bringing it below 100,000 before the general election. What do you give a dumb punter who has lost everything. Sympathy? He hardly deserves it.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps some advice, instead. The first thing to say is that he should stop taking silly positions. His problem here is EU migration. He can't do much about that. He shouldn't have given the impression that events outside his control were within it. He can't change the rules because his EU partners won't let him. And regardless of the chunterings from his backbenchers, he knows that to actually leave the EU \u8211\'20\'13 the only way to regain complete control \u8211\'20\'13 would be ruinous for Britain in terms of economics and world positioning. The path to irrelevance.\par \par \uc2 He acted as he did to show those backbenchers that he is a toughie, to draw the poison from the tabloids, and to head off Ukip. But over-promising has left him in a worse position with all three than he was in before, and with his credibility in tatters. He should get back to square one and fast.\par \par \uc2 He needs to start listening, as he should have from the outset, to the people who actually have to make his market-based capitalist system work. They are against his crude machinations on migration because they know how it affects their efforts to provide for Britain the economy he says he wants. He has, to use Geoffrey Howe's cricketing metaphor, been sending them out to the crease having sabotaged their bats.\par \par \uc2 Frustrated by his inability to deal with EU migration, Cameron will inevitably redouble efforts to rein in non-EU migration, which might be popular for a while, not least because it might also curb visible migration by non-white Commonweath types. But if he does opt for a rethink, he might use as a starting point advice from Mark Boleat, policy chair of the City of London Corporation. Writing yesterday in the London Evening Standard, Boleat said: "What is needed is a sensible, fact-based debate over what migrants bring to the capital, while also acknowledging their impact on communities and services. A row where only the loudest are heard fails this test \u8230\'20\'26 Policymakers should clamp down on those \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who come to Britain to take rather than contribute. But the overwhelming majority of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  come here to make a better life for themselves and their families through hard work, and in so doing are of huge benefit to Britain. Closing our borders or Swiss-style \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  quotas are not viable or sensible solutions." No hangwringing Guardianista is he; no authority more instinctively Conservative than the City of London Corporation.\par \par \uc2 The PM might opt to be brave. To take on the unreasoned, backward thinking populism we hear from Ukip and his right. To rein in his own election strategist Lynton Crosby who, from all we have seen in this and previous campaigns, appears to think that divisive manoeuvring on migration works like some form of electoral Viagra.\par \par \uc2 Cameron might decide to have a straightforward and honest conversation with the public. People flows and money flows are how the modern world works; there will be costs and benefits. We can rage against the dynamic or we can better adapt to it, thinking more about how we channel resources to those areas most affected, how we strike the balance between the needs of long-term residents and those newly arrived, and how we achieve balanced and harmonious communities.\par \par \uc2 This is hard, mainly because it means a break from the nostalgia that underpins the worst of our failings in this area. But there really is no going back to Britain as it was. It is hard but it is necessary, and the PM may observe one of life's ironies: with failure comes opportunity.\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140228ea310012x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Leader Pages\par \b \uc2 Leading Article: Migration politics: Beyond the blame game\b0\par\par\uc2 695 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 36\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 There are several contrasting ways of pulling together the domestic political threads of the past few days. One prominent version, promoted by much of the press and reflected in many polls, says they show that Britain faces a migration-driven crisis. Nigel Farage spoke for this view when he told his Ukip conference in Torquay yesterday that parts of the country are unrecognisable. According to this version of events, the failure to control migration is at the heart of long-term national decline, a general collapse of confidence in the welfare system and the sustained fall in real wages.\par \par \uc2 In this narrative of Britain's options, this week's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  figures, showing net migration at 212,000, a rise of almost a third over the previous year, and driven mainly by migration from within the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , become damning evidence of the failure of government to address the core of the crisis. They certainly leave David Cameron's pledges to cut net migration to 100,000 by next year looking unachievable. With Angela Merkel making clear this week that EU freedom of movement must be maintained, Mr Farage sees an opportunity for migration anxieties to power Ukip to victory in May's European elections.\par \par \uc2 This is not, however, the only way of looking at these facts and issues. There is another way that says no European country can now, on its own, preserve the economic prosperity and welfare settlements of the 20th century without co-ordinated adjustment, managed reform and freedom of movement. Pulling up the drawbridge in the face of global economic change and the digital era, the course implied by Ukip, is simply not possible. Britain's problems, in other words, are not unique to Britain, or solvable by an island improbably restored to its role as a global power. The problems are shared, common to our part of the world, all connected, and they are only manageable in a flexible but co-operative way.\par \par \uc2 That, in essence, is the message that Mrs Merkel brought to Britain this week. It is not an easy message to put into practice, sometimes even for a Germany that is broadly comfortable with the shared European approach, let alone for a Britain that is broadly uncomfortable with it and which still battles to adjust to aspects of the continent around us.\par \par \uc2 But, for all its limitations and problems, it is still a better message than the one that places migration, as such, at the heart of our problems. As Mrs Merkel said in her speech, fair migration within Europe is in many respects a great shared achievement. But it needs to command the confidence of Europe's citizens. That is why the German chancellor acknowledged there may be a need for prosperous countries such as Germany and Britain to look again at aspects of migrants' access to welfare in order to reassure native workers and taxpayers. That is still a much more optimistic message than the one that demonises everything about the EU and European migrants, as Ukip does and as the Eurosceptics who have wrenched control of Tory party policy also do.\par \par \uc2 Only a fool would make the mistake of not taking Mr Farage and Ukip seriously. But their goal is to embarrass the other parties, not to change the world. No one who listened to Mr Farage's speech yesterday would have heard anything positive or practical. Ukip's currency, ably articulated by its leader, is blame - blaming migrants for causing Britain's crisis, and blaming governments for allowing them to do so. Yet it remains massively unclear what Ukip aims to do about migration, except to stop it, and even more unclear how it would do that. But that is because Mr Farage is a spoiler, nothing more. He often comes close, as he did in a speech last month at a TaxPayers' Alliance event, to admitting that in his view of politics there is nothing to be done. But there is - and this week it was Mrs Merkel, not Mr Farage or Mr Cameron, who set a version of that out best.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140228ea310009p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The voice was unmistakable, the Hampshire burr that stood out like a marrow in an orchard of plums among the cut-glass distorted vowels of immediate postwar broadcasting. John Arlott, who would have celebrated his 100th birthday this week, had easily the most unconventional path to the microphone of any regular practitioner: clerk in a mental home; wartime policeman screening conscientious objectors; published poet who became a friend of Dylan Thomas and John Betjeman; literary programmes producer at the BBC in succession to George Orwell. He espoused the cause of the common man with an unabashed liberalism - twice as an aspiring Liberal MP - and after a visit to South Africa, where he answered "human" to an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  officer who inquired as to his race, became an outspoken opponent of the apartheid regime. He was later instrumental in the "rescue" of the so\u8209\'20\'11called Cape Coloured Basil D'Oliveira, which led to a cricketing schism.\par \par \uc2 As a journalist he was most notably both the cricket and wine correspondent of the Guardian. The latter job he claimed as a right by asking "who else has got 5,000 bottles in their cellar?" And his command of the airwaves, particularly during his cricket commentary, was legendary: "His bat has as many holes in it as a Henry Moore sculpture"; "Botham runs in like a shire horse, cresting the breeze". The bon mots were prolific, and mostly spontaneous. When I congratulated him on his famous 1975 commentary at Lord's, when a streaker (Arlott called him a "freaker") vaulted the stumps before being ejected from the ground, he replied "No, I blew it.

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage said mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was making parts of the country appear "unrecognisable" and like "a foreign land" at Ukip's spring conference yesterday.\par \par \uc2 The speech put \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at the heart of Ukip's campaign for the European and local elections, which Farage followed with a declaration that he would resign if his party failed to win a seat in parliament in 2015. But he appeared to concede some concerns raised by Ukip about the scale of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from Bulgaria and Romania may have been unfounded. The greatest potential threat now came from the eurozone, Farage claimed.\par \par \uc2 "In scores of our cities and market towns, this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognisable," Farage told his audience in Torquay. "Whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don't hear English spoken any more. This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."\par \par \uc2 Asked at his press conference to justify the comments, Farage cited a recent experience on a rush-hour train leaving Charing Cross. "It was a stopper going out and we stopped at London Bridge, New Cross, Hither Green, it was not until we got past Grove Park that I could hear English being audibly spoken in the carriage," he said. "Does that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes it does." Asked why he minded people speaking in foreign languages, he replied: "I don't understand them . . . I don't feel very comfortable in that situation and I don't think the majority of British people do."\par \par \uc2 With some observers tipping Ukip to win the Europeans elections, even though polls have yet to show it overtaking Labour, members arrived in Torquay knowing expectations are high but that the party is still tainted by associations with extremism. Ukip believes its stance on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  can win votes from all sides of the political spectrum.\par \par \uc2 Ukip was criticised for saying 29 million Bulgarians and Romanians would have the right to live, work and draw benefits in the UK from January. In his speech Farage raised a fresh concern."It isn't directly Romania and Bulgaria I'm necessarily concerned about. What I'm really concerned about is the fact in the eurozone, in the Mediterranean there is no sign or prospect of any significant recovery at all," he said.\par \par \uc2 Leader comment, page 36 \u8805\'22\'65\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage declared that he would resign if his party failed to win any seats in\par \par \uc2 parliament in the 2015 election\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140228ea31000bd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Saturday Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 New Etonian: Ishak Ayiris grew up in one of the country's poorest boroughs, but now he's off to Eton. It will change his life, but it won't change his values, he tells Emine Saner\b0\par\par\uc2 1,769 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 30\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ishak Ayiris didn't really know much about Eton when his headteacher suggested he apply for a scholarship. He vaguely knew it was a public school that David Cameron had been to, but that was about it. For around a month, Ayiris and Simon Elliott, the headteacher of Forest Gate Community School in Newham, east London, had been having discussions at lunchtime that had started when Ayiris had asked him about the Iraq war, but soon moved on to politics more widely. A few weeks later, won over by his student's interest and intelligence, Elliott suggested he try for a scholarship to Eton College. I see what his headteacher must have seen - soon after meeting Ayiris, 15 and articulate and inquisitive, at a cafe near where he lives in Newham, he has mentioned government foreign policy, the suffragette movement, Islamophobia, quoted Malcolm X and asked about the state of the newspaper industry, all in a charming, not remotely arrogant, manner.\par \par \uc2  His parents, father Abate and mother Bekelech, are with him, and look on with a mix of extreme pride and bemusement - both are from Ethopia and neither received a formal education as children.\par \par \uc2 "I told him it would be a good idea but if he didn't get in, I was afraid he would be disappointed," says his father. "We knew he was a special boy," says his mother. "He liked reading, he talked too much." Ayriris plays down his gifts: "It wasn't like I was a sort of genius. I was an average kid and I liked to read. Once the headteacher told me about Eton I started to read many more non-fiction books, about history, current affairs, politics, the Iraq war for example. It was an overall process." He enjoyed school and enjoyed getting high grades, though he felt, he says, that "I didn't fit in - it wasn't as if I was someone who could sit with the other kids and have a laugh. Even today, I only have a few close friends. Other than that, school was just fine."\par \par \uc2 Ishak was singled out last year while he was in year 10, and the school also identified two other boys who had the potential to win scholarships to the top public schools: Irfan Badshah (who is going to Winchester) and Alexis Marinou (City of London School). "Like a lot of schools, certainly in the East End, we've got a lot of children who are aspirational, but I don't think that they ever think they can go on to be part of these elite institutions," says Simon Elliott when I speak to him on the phone. At his school, in one of the most deprived boroughs in the country, nearly 40% of children claim free school meals. "Myself and my deputy resolved to work with a select group of students to open their minds." The plan, he says, is to identify three or four students each year and try to win them scholarships. They have tended to be boys so far, because they are aiming for places at boys' schools.\par \par \uc2 For more than a year, Ayiris, Badshah and Marinou were nurtured. The teachers used the pupil premium, an extra funding scheme for poorer students, to buy them books - such as Edward Said's Orientalism, and others by John Pilger and Robert Fisk - and would spend lunchtimes discussing and debating with them. The boys were encouraged to attend public lectures and go to political rallies, and encouraged to talk to their teachers about what they had learned and thought. As much as anything, says Elliott, it was about developing their confidence and getting them to engage with adults.\par \par \uc2 When I ask Ayiris if he thinks the education he has received so far will put him behind his new Eton peers, he says the only difference between them he can tell is one of confidence. "From a young age, they are told they can have whatever they want and succeed in whatever way they want, and by going to these schools they understand they can, because the schools have history. So they do have that innate sense of success. Whereas in Newham, it's not really given to you - you're not really told you can succeed. My headteacher gave me hope and that's what I clung onto and it pushed me."\par \par \uc2 Ayiris's parents came to the UK, separately, in the early 90s, and met and married here. At 17, his father had moved to Egypt where, on his third try, he won a scholarship to a school in Cairo, having had barely any formal education before. His mother who, like her husband, grew up in the countryside, lived two hours' walk away from the nearest school - besides which, it was only for boys. She worked in a bakery before making her way to the UK. In press reports this week about Ayiris's achievement, much has been made of the fact his parents are \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who live in a council house and claim benefits, and the family seem stung by the negative tones. Bekelech, who has a hearing impairment and is still learning English, stayed at home to raise their children, and Abate had a job as a care worker until he was forced out by ill health. "Some newspapers have said, 'Son of Ethiopian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  on benefits gets into Eton'," says Ayiris. "I don't think [I got the place] because I was on benefits. It was based on how I did during the interviews and exams."\par \par \uc2 Still, does it make him a little uneasy that he has been given an opportunity that many other children from deprived areas, perhaps just as clever as he is, don't get? He nods. "I still wonder why, across the UK, there can't be equal education. Some people would say, 'If you want equal education, why are you applying to these schools?' But I have to better myself if I want to improve other areas." His hope, he says, is to go on to Oxford to read politics or history, before coming back to Newham and getting involved in politics, particularly on a local level, and perhaps as an independent candidate ("I see Labour and the Conservatives as two cheeks of the same backside"). "I don't want to be a career politician in the sense that you get into Oxford and then become a politician. I want to change my area, and live here for the rest of my life."\par \par \uc2 For Eton, of course, success stories such as Ayiris's reflect well on them. In the last few years the school has become a kind of shorthand for Britain's declining social mobility - with the current prime minister, London mayor, Archbishop of Canterbury and numerous successful actors, journalists and cultural figures all Old Etonians, the exclusive school is seen as dominating large parts of public life.\par \par \uc2 Like other independent schools, it is supposed to offer bursaries to gifted but disadvantaged children, among other public benefits, in order to justify its charitable status and associated tax breaks. Eton's aim, it has said, is to admit a quarter of its students on reduced fees, with 70 boys paying nothing, though they are still a way off that - and even then, 70 is a tiny proportion of its 1,300 students. Around 50 boys currently pay no fees.\par \par \uc2 Even if the school's motives are sincere, rather than cynical - Eton's headmaster, \uc2 Tony Little\uc2 , is himself a bursary boy, whose father was a Heathrow security guard - giving a chance to a handful of non-privileged boys each year can hardly do much to reverse the trends in social mobility. "As far as this young lad's concerned, good luck to him," says Michael Pyke, spokesperson for the Campaign for State Education. "But the idea that this can be replicated to a large enough extent to make a significant difference is completely fatuous. If Eton started offering free places to a significant percentage of people, that would different, but they can't do that because they would then find that people who are paying pounds 33,000 a year for their children will be wondering why their fees are going on this sort of thing."\par \par \uc2 A "significant percentage", he thinks, would be what Anthony Seldon, the headteacher at Wellington College, proposed in January - around 25% of places at independent schools to be reserved for disadvantaged children. "But of course it's pie in the sky."\par \par \uc2 Ayiris's place at Eton, to study A levels in English, history, politics and maths, still depends on getting good grades at GCSE, though he seems quietly confident. Is he worried about not fitting in there? "At the start I was thinking that, but later on, speaking to the students [at the open day he attended], I realised they weren't too different. The first question they asked was, 'What team do you support?', and I thought they'd ask me about politics or something. I think that once you get in, they don't really care about your background. You're just another student there. I'd have to find out once I get in how it's going to be, but I have spoken to other students who got scholarships and they said it was fine, they just got on like normal students."\par \par \uc2 Being exposed to people with money may take some getting used to, he says, though adds that his has "been a normal life for me. You don't understand that your parents don't have a lot of money, because I had everything I wanted." This, he says, amounted to books, games consoles, access to the local library and playing tennis in the nearby local park. "There's nothing I could complain about." Eton, he says, "will change my life but it won't change my values."\par \par \uc2 Will he become another old Etonian, though one a bit more in touch with ordinary people, to make it to prime minister? "Who knows?" says his father, smiling.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Eton College, alma mater of the current prime minister, London mayor and Archbishop of Canterbury\par \par \uc2 'It wasn't like I was a sort of genius.

\par\par \b \uc2 Ukip leader Nigel Farage says parts of UK 'taken over' by \uc2 immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jim Pickard, Chief Political Correspondent   \par \uc2 585 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par 00:06\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage has escalated the political row over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  by warning that many areas of Britain are being "taken over" by incomers, making them "unrecognisable".\par \par \uc2 The leader of the UK Independence party said untrammelled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from the EU had done "great damage to the cohesion of our society". Speaking on Friday at Ukip's spring conference in Torquay, Mr Farage said he felt "uncomfortable" sitting on a train full of foreigners.\par \par \uc2 While insisting that he was "not anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ", Mr Farage nevertheless said that parts of Britain were becoming a "foreign land".\par \par \uc2 "I got the train the other night, it was rush hour, from Charing Cross. It was a stopper going out and we stopped at London Bridge, New Cross, Hither Green," he said. "It was not til we got past Grove Park that I could hear English being audibly spoken in the carriage. Does that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes it does."\par \par \uc2 His comments on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  came a day after data showed a jump in net migration to the UK by more than a third to 212,000 in the year to September.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said many schools now had a predominance of children for whom English was not their main language. Britain had an enviable record for race relations and tolerance compared to the rest of Europe, he said. "Integration is very important but \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on the scale we have seen under New Labour makes that very much harder."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage earlier made an explicit pitch for former Labour voters, telling the conference that his party now poses the biggest threat to the political establishment in modern history. "This is the moment we've been waiting for," the Ukip leader said. "This is the big one."\par \par \uc2 The anti-Brussels party still has no seats in Westminster but is expected to pick up more than a quarter of the British votes in the imminent European parliamentary elections.\par \par \uc2 Asked if he would quit if Ukip had no MPs in Westminster after the next general election in 2015, Mr Farage said: "Good God, yes: I'd be out of the door faster than Jack Robinson."\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader was speaking to the world's media where he was visibly rattled by some questions, including why Neil Hamilton, the disgraced former Conservative MP, was organising his European election campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said only a third of people backing Ukip were former Tory voters, with the rest of the support coming from across the political spectrum. His attempt at claiming political equidistance between the two parties belies the traditional view of Ukip as a haven for rightwing Tories unhappy with prime minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's moderate path.\par \par \uc2 Ukip is hoping to pick up votes in Labour metropolitan strongholds in the north, as well as the Tory shires, in the May local and European elections. It is putting forward a record 2,500 candidates to stand in the local elections.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip gathering in Torquay has attracted unprecedented media attention, with journalists from Chinese state media, five Swiss outlets and 15 attendants from the BBC.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage dismissed the idea that Mr Cameron could renegotiate Britain's place in the EU as a precursor to a referendum on membership.\par \par \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2 , the German chancellor, had made clear that renegotiation was merely an attempt by Mr Cameron to "kick the issue into the long grass beyond the next election", he said.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140301ea310002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - HOUSE & HOME\par \b \uc2 Why I need two homes\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ben Pentreath   \par \uc2 1,476 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFTA\par \uc2 Surveys RES1\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Ben Pentreath responds to critics of his decision to rent a flat in London and a house in Dorset, rather than buy a single property\par \par \uc2 I wrote a little article for House & Home the other day on why I like renting , and it never occurred to me that it would generate so much comment. First my mum didn't like the headline ("Rent Boy"), second came critiques from \uc2 Lucy Kellaway\uc2  , and more recently Ed Hammond . Then there was a curiously hysterical lady who wrote something on the message boards along the lines that "Ben Pentreath can only afford all this because he's gay and doesn't want children", which was somewhat personal, and also inaccurate given that my four-bedroom house in Dorset would happily accommodate my family, if I had one. I reckon that same family would be pretty happy to have a nice two-bedroom flat in WC1. I can't quite quote her accurately because a moderator eventually removed her witty gem, something she took the opportunity to complain about in a comment on the \uc2 Lucy Kellaway\uc2  column the following week. But it would have probably been truer for her to write "Ben Pentreath is too much of a workaholic to form a lasting relationship", let alone make a family, but that's a subject for another day.\par \par \uc2 A lot of people found the whole conversation a bit smug, which was unanswerable; and London-centric, which was equally true. Many people were apt to write "but he didn't reveal his rent", which merely means you don't understand word counts, or how to keep the flow of prose (Dorset: \u163\'00\'A31,250, rising to \u163\'00\'A31,500 per month after five years, in part compensation for the improvements I made when I signed the long lease; London, currently \u163\'00\'A31,420 per month, which will also rise to about \u163\'00\'A31,820 per month on the same basis). A number of people were very cross that I hadn't revealed the names of my landlords, which I'm still not going to do in print, but the readers who sent me an email with that question were promptly put in touch with the agents.\par \par \uc2 There was a lot of conversation about not being able to paint your walls the colour you want, which is something I've always been very surprised by (just paint your whole flat white at your own expense when you leave, which is cheaper than two days skiing - and you can live there how you want for five or ten years). The fear of people to make roots in rental houses is actually a fear of making roots generally. Which, in our transient, internet-surfing, restless lives, is a wider cultural problem; one that only, just for a start, equates meaning with ownership.\par \par \uc2 But of all the commentary, the one that niggled was a letter to the editor which read: "Sir, it is refreshing that Ben Pentreath prefers to rent his home in Dorset, and his London flat," it began, "rather than buying a property and being saddled with debt. I wish him well, but does it really make sense for one person to occupy two homes in such 'desirable' areas when the country is suffering an acute housing shortage?"\par \par \uc2 Gosh. Well, This Reader had at least understood something that I think both Kellaway and Hammond, in their beautifully written pieces, had failed to pick up - one of the big reasons I rent is because, for me, it appears to be a lot cheaper than buying the equivalent house. And one of the reasons I'm interested in it being cheaper is because I want to live in two places. Doubtless, let's face it, if I was putting \u163\'00\'A31,500 plus \u163\'00\'A31,820 into a London mortgage, I'd get somewhere solid in Camden, wouldn't I?\par \par \uc2 That would be to neglect one small salient fact. I love living in two places at once. Which is why, as I say, of all the commentary, the one which I found most offensive was This Reader's mean statement that my personal choice was somehow contributing to the housing shortage.\par \par \uc2 Let me explain. I am a Dorset boy. I was born in Dorchester, the county town. So in a sense, my living here is all to do with nurturing roots. One of the curious things about my Old Parsonage is that in the 1970s and early 1980s, my best friend Ben's parents rented the house for about 15 years. I grew up in that house, a real home from home. So I have been curiously drawn back here my whole life, and it was amazing when I found myself in a position to rent, the house empty, and the landlord looking for a tenant.\par \par \uc2 My decision to have a West Country base is not pure nostalgia. I do a lot of work in Dorset. For years now, I've worked on Poundbury, Prince Charles's urban extension of Dorchester, and we're at present doing some quite big schemes in neighbouring Weymouth. Once a month, and most fortnights, I'm down for work for at least a couple of days. My house in Dorset is essential to my sanity in making these and other work visits, rather than always trekking back to London at the end of the day. Dorset is where I have my drawing board; it's where I design buildings, and enjoy some quiet space to think, which is not always possible in the more frenetic pace of London.\par \par \uc2 It's not just about work. Having two houses is what keeps me grounded. It's a tradition that extends back as far as Pliny's villas of ancient Rome; leaving the city; spending time in the country, deep in my garden, walking, or pottering up and down our beautiful coastline. Sometimes, I'm in Dorset alone for days at a time; sometimes my house is filled with friends and family. Many of the significant moments of my year are marked there. And there's a richness to life in two places that I think is inestimable.\par \par \uc2 I am aware, of course, that this entire conversation is ready for submission to that brilliant meme "First World Problems", otherwise known as White Whine. But there is something serious, and underlying about this. I presume that some of my critics do not sanction rich people taking up more room generally. Should one person occupy a large house, I wonder? (The government's rather toxic-sounding "bedroom tax" touches rather uncomfortably to my mind on this precise issue).\par \par \uc2 There is a lot in the press about commuter villages, where the lights come on each Friday evening and go off on Sunday night. I made a personal choice, for sure, to avoid the grim tweeness of the Cotswolds, where every house is done up to the nines with \uc2 Farrow & Ball\uc2  paint and electric Agas, but I'm not sure that having a few second-home owners in a village isn't an enriching thing. For a start, one of my most important roles in life is chairman of our village social club (elected three years in a row now, despite my desperation to stop). Frankly, I'm as scared by places where no outsiders are welcomed as by the villages where no locals can afford to live. Everything, presumably, is a question of balance.\par \par \uc2 A lot of my work, indirectly, is do with addressing the housing shortage; which has developed for many reasons - an ageing population; the increase in divorced households; the desire of young people to own their own homes. Quite a long way down the list (doubtless to the disappointment of Ukip) is \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , and, very far down, foreign investors in London property - which receives a disproportionate amount of screaming time in the media. Second-home ownership doubtless plays its part too, but I've always found the English to be slightly hysterical on the subject.\par \par \uc2 Fundamentally, we're not building enough homes in this country to keep up with demand. I could give up my life in Dorset, or, I suppose in London, but I don't think that would solve a thing. Governments that control where you live, or how big your house is, haven't tended to succeed, or indeed to make happy societies that I would like to live in. So for as long as I'm allowed, by government, I'd love to be allowed to work in London, but to be able to leave, and come to another house of my own, where I can rest my head in my own bed, and clear my mind, ready for another day.\par \par \uc2 To comment on this article, visit FT.com/twohomes\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140301ea310003l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Books | The Romani face a lot of prejudice about their way of life, but is it so different from our own? I MET LUCKY PEOPLE: THE STORY OF THE ROMANI GYPSIES BY YARON MATRAS (ALLEN LANE, \u163\'00\'A320) \u187\'00\'BB Order at \u163\'00\'A316 inc. p&p from the Independent Bookshop\par \par \uc2 WHO ARE THE ROMANI people? They are, Yaron Matras writes, a nation like no other, without territory, sovereignty or institutions, and with no tradition of agriculture or ownership of land. Yet they are also a model of cultural tolerance and flexibility who "are the only nation in Europe and western Asia that has never declared war on another nation and that has never tried to subjugate others into adopting its ways". We have a lot to learn from them.\par \par \uc2 Romani history is unseen and unrecognised. Matras synthesises what facts we have to create a visible, compelling record. I Met Lucky People explores Romani society, customs, language, identity - and history. Their history possesses a merciless quality. "I travelled long roads and I met lucky people" is the first line of the song "Gelem, Gelem", now the Romani national anthem written by a survivor of three concentration camps during World War Two.\par \par \uc2 The genocide of the Roms under the Nazis is usually invisible - because of the Romani fear of the dead, and the shame of the brutalised survivors. Humiliation continued after the war. Although investigations took place, no criminal charges were brought against any of those suspected of the genocide of Gypsies.\par \par \uc2 Yet knowing more about the Roma is "not a guarantee for tolerance, nor is it a prerequisite for affection" - although the Roma have found friends in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , The \uc2 World Bank\uc2  and the \uc2 Open Society Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Knowledge of their culture can find itself at odds with the double-bind of Gypsy romanticisation. The exotic image of Gypsies - apparent superpowers, ability to tell fortunes - has not only been foisted upon the Roma but sometimes self-cultivated to maintain invisibility within a hostile and, at times, lethal majority culture. Matras has little time for the exotic, nor for the fiction and fantasy that "have dominated the depiction of Gypsies in the arts and literatures for many centuries". Academic study, he claims, is the best answer to prejudice. I'd argue that the imaginations of Romani artists such as Delaine Le Bas, and dramatists such as Dan Allum of the Romani Theatre Company, are equally essential to addressing that challenge.\par \par \uc2 Matras detects small, significant enlightenments both within the Roma community and in Gadje (non-Roma) cultures. Some of these are local events with larger implications. Since 2010, for example, Manchester Roma \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  worked successfully with schools, police, academics and charities. Their 'Roma Strategy' project is an example that dealt with realities, not Gadje bigotry or Roma self-romancing. School attendance of Romani children outstripped that of non-Romani children.\par \par \uc2 Matras raises fascinating questions. Can one become Romani by adoption or choice? Are we all Gypsies? He believes that "in embracing global, transnational and cosmopolitan attitudes, we are becoming in some ways more like the Roms, while the Roms are adopting some of our ways". Romani identity has assumed "a new twist". It is rarely a matter of heredity (the Nazi death-camps having obliterated thousands of family lines), but of the narratives we shape and share. Matras believes that negotiating a Romani identity is now as much about being free to pick who we are, and what blend of customs and values we call our own. As citizens of the world, there is fresh force in the Angloromani phrase: "We are all one: all who are with us are ourselves".\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140301ea310003b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

However, having spent 40 years teaching in secondary education, I have lost count of the number of initiatives targeted towards the socalled "non-academics". Our education system continues to be a feeder system for the universities.\par \par \uc2 Vocational education has always been the preserve of those not suited to A-levels and higher education.\par \par \uc2 Lip service to parity of esteem has been shown through initiatives such as the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative, Youth Training Scheme etc. All have failed because, unlike many European countries, we have always looked down upon training, rather than academia, as a worthwhile career.\par \par \uc2 MIKE ANCIL TAVISTOCK, DEVON\par \par \uc2 Vote the Scots out\par \par \uc2 It is for the residents of Scotland alone to decide if they wish to remain in the UK. But that does not preclude a referendum for the rest of the UK to vote on expelling the Scots. As an Englishman, I would certainly vote for expulsion. Why should we subsidise the Scots and, above all, why should they be doubly represented, with an MP in London and an MSP in Edinburgh?\par \par \uc2 EDWARD JEAVONS\par \par \uc2 Summer-born dilemma\par \par \uc2 I read with sympathy the article on summer-born children. ("Too much, too young?", 27 February). A child not quite ready for school being punished by having to miss a whole stage of early education when she does start... the distress of her mother, Ms McLoughlin, speaks volumes.\par \par \uc2 The article, like many I have read on summerborn children, misses a salient point of comparison. In Scotland the cut-off point for entry at the end of February is at a different time of year from the term start date. The youngest a child can be at the start of Primary 1 is fourand-a-half. Furthermore January- and Februaryborn children (and sometimes Novemberand December-born) can have their entry to nursery and P1 deferred to the following session.\par \par \uc2 A different system on the doorstep has been in practice for years - separating age boundaries from the start of the school session, and allowing parents to select deferment at the younger end of the cohort - thereby possibly transforming a "youngest" child to an "oldest".\par \par \uc2 We have many concerns to deal with in Scottish education, but summer-born fouryear-olds missing reception is not one of them.\par \par \uc2 HARRIET NEVILL DUNBLANE\par \par \uc2 I have just read the article on summer-born children and disagree. Our daughter was born in early July (11 weeks prematurely). She started school (parttime) when she was four and two months. She loved it and was raring to read. She scored highly in Richmond tests, but on moving to Gloucestershire from Cornwall, she trod water for a year. On starting grammar school, she was bullied, but the school dealt with it brilliantly. This held her back a little but she achieved average Sats results at 13 and then achieved above-expected at GCSE and A-level and finally with her degree. If she had waited another year to start school, she would have been bored silly attending playgroup.\par \par \uc2 L SMITH GLOUCESTERSHIRE\par \par \uc2 I would like to correct a common misconception that school is compulsory and the education of our children is the responsibility of the state. Sarah Cassidy wrote "children do not have to be in education until the term after their fifth birthday. But if they delay, they forfeit the right to a place in reception." She is confusing "education" with "school".\par \par \uc2 The Education Act 1996 places the duty of a child's education on the parents, not the state.\par \par \uc2 I have much sympathy for Ms McLoughlin when she describes having "no choice at all" regarding her daughter's education. The McLoughlins could look into the choices available through Elective Home Education.\par \par \uc2 FLEUR ATKINS\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  increases\par \par \uc2 What further proof do we need that the people running the country are insane than Vince Cable exulting over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rising?\par \par \uc2 We live in a tiny country, short on housing and with services overrun, are \u163\'00\'A31.2trn in debt yet are paying benefits to people who have never contributed.\par \par \uc2 We are paying to keep millions of people on the dole and benefits, while importing more cheap labour. It's a lose-lose situation for those of us picking up the tab.\par \par \uc2 PHIL GRANGER WEST MALLING, KENT\par \par \uc2 Low marks for \uc2 Lloyd Webber\par \par \uc2 Natalie Haynes ("Why can't we do musicals any more?", 28 February) comments that it comes "as little surprise to anyone" that Andrew Lloyd Webber's latest musical is closing early; and ALW himself says that he is resigned to the fact that anything he does probably nobody is going to like. As a professional musician, it is no surprise at all to me that the public have tired of his musicals; nothing new, tunes that you've heard in some shape or form before, and harmonies that might struggle to gain an E grade in GCSE music.\par \par \uc2 RICHARD LESTER CIRENCESTER\par \par \uc2 Merkel victorious\par \par \uc2 Angela Merkel's speech to Parliament on Britain's future in Europe merely confirms the opinion that, while Britain won the war, Germany certainly won the peace.\par \par \uc2 MIKE BAKER BROMSGROVE\par \par \uc2 More signs of madness\par \par \uc2 Two names that made me laugh:\par \par \uc2 A sandwich bar in Winchester: Baguetti Junction; and a bric-a-brac shop in Totton, Hampshire: Junk & Disorderly.\par \par \uc2 ANTHONY R YOUNG ASHURST, HAMPSHIRE\par \par \uc2 In Blackpool there's a carpet store called Walter Wall Carpets.

His problem here is EU migration. He can't do much about that. He shouldn't have given the impression that events outside his control were within it. He can't change the rules because his EU partners won't let him. And regardless of the chunterings from his backbenchers, he knows that to actually leave the EU - the only way to regain complete control - would be ruinous for Britain in terms of economics and world positioning...

He insisted all women wearing a \u8220\'20\'1Cfull Islamic veil" should have to compulsorily remove it to be identified by \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  officials.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hollobone told the Commons that he had received correspondence from alarmed Britons across the country.\par \par \uc2 His bill would prevent the use of balaclavas, favoured by some demonstrators, as well as full-face Islamic veils such as burkas and niqabs.\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8220\'20\'1CI can find absolutely nowhere at all anywhere in the world any prescription that women are required by Islam to cover their face.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAs far as I can understand it, the Koran \u8211\'20\'13 the holy book to Muslims \u8211\'20\'13 requires women to dress modestly."\par \par \uc2 Men are dressing up as Islamic women in burkas to commit crimes, he added. Terror suspect Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed went missing last November after changing into a burka at a mosque.\par \par \uc2 But Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said he could not recall any other incidents of that nature.\par \par \uc2 Rushanara Ali, Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, a London constituency with a large Muslim population, described the Bill as \u8220\'20\'1Cnarrow-minded and intolerant".\par \par \uc2 But Mr Hollobone said his Bill would remove ambiguity in public places, such as garages, courts of law, police stations and schools on how to deal with face coverings.\par \par \uc2 Shadow communities minister Lyn Brown said it would lead to an increase in people wearing face coverings. \u8220\'20\'1CIn a fundamentally British tradition, the introduction of such an illiberal law would, I feel, encourage civil disobedience and an affinity with those who are seen to be targeted."\par \par \uc2 The Bill is unlikely to make progress after running out of time to complete its second reading yesterday. Mr Hollobone said the debate would resume on May 16 but is likely to be relegated to the bottom of the day\u8217\'20\'19s list of business.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140301ea3100107\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Political Sketch\par \b \uc2 Fruitcakes go barmy for leader with the winning smell\b0\par\par\uc2 Ann Treneman, Political Sketch   \par \uc2 601 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par 00:17\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 I suspected that I\u8217\'20\'19d found the UKIP conference in Torquay when I saw a man in the car park dressed in a three-piece wine red corduroy suit, accessorised with obligatory \u163\'00\'A31 UKIP badge. They do like to do dapper at UKIP. But it was the man with the fruitcake that clinched it.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHave some fruitcake!" urged Herbert Crossman, beaming with pure happiness as he handed me something crumbly. \u8220\'20\'1CThe only fruitcake here is on the tray!" This is not quite true, but as someone who has covered UKIP for many years I can report that yesterday\u8217\'20\'19s shindig at the Riviera Centre in Torquay was, definitely, UKIP\u8217\'20\'19s first post-fruitcake conference.\par \par \uc2 The party leader, Nigel Farage, has spent the past year ruthlessly culling the party of (most) of its major screwballs. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ve got rid of them!" he shouted yesterday. Badgers aren\u8217\'20\'19t the only thing endangered here. The transformation of UKIP to NewKIP is almost complete.\par \par \uc2 Of course, more than any other party, this one IS its leader. Nigel Farage, rhymes with barrage, arrived on the stage festooned with signs that said \u8220\'20\'1CLove Britain, Vote UKIP", his marvellously cartoony rubber face morphing into a look of wonder as he gazed out at the crowd.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNIGE!" a woman near me cried.\par \par \uc2 It was a riveting performance and, as I watched him, I saw that \u8220\'20\'1CNige" is a party leader with more than a touch of the demagogue about him. The speech was a barnburner and at the core of it was a message on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  delivered with the precision of an Exocet.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe fact is that in scores of our cities and market towns, this country, in a short space of time, has frankly become unrecognisable!" he cried.\par \par \uc2 How they loved it! Every one of the 700 or so people crammed into this hall clapped.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a fact that in many parts of England you don\u8217\'20\'19t hear English spoken any more. This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."\par \par \uc2 I looked around. The faces of the NewKippers were rapt.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CDid you see the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  figures yesterday?" asked Nige to a room of despairing nods (the figure showed a large increase, almost all from Europe). \u8220\'20\'1CIf the eurozone goes as badly over the next few years as I believe it will, we face the prospect of the largest migratory wave that has ever come to this country and we have three political parties who are not prepared to do anything."\par \par \uc2 It was UKIP, he said, that had made it possible to debate \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CRemember ten years ago? You couldn\u8217\'20\'19t talk about it. If you did, somehow, you were a terrible, bad person. We proved the point. It is not extremist to talk about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , it is responsible and right!"\par \par \uc2 He made forays into other subjects \u8212\'20\'14 quangos, floods and the foreign aid budget to name a few \u8212\'20\'14 but then exhorted his groupies (sorry, audience) that the message for the next 84 days (he knows, he ticks off every day until the Euro elections) must be about Europe.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is the moment that we waited for!" he barked, his voice overpowering the microphone and the room. \u8220\'20\'1CThis IS it! This is the big one for UKIP. Together we can achieve something remarkable in these European elections. We can top those polls."\par \par \uc2 He received an instant standing ovation. As he toured the room, pressing the flesh, I could almost smell how much he wants to win.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140301ea3100109\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 I feel awkward in towns where no one talks English, Farage tells party\b0\par\par\uc2 Laura Pitel, Political Correspondent   \par \uc2 540 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par 00:17\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Parts of Britain have become unrecognisable after being taken over by migrants, Nigel Farage claimed yesterday.\par \par \uc2 In a speech at his party\u8217\'20\'19s spring conference, the UKIP leader said that there were market towns in England where only foreign languages could be heard on the streets.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don\u8217\'20\'19t hear English spoken any more, this is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren," he said. Mr Farage added that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  would be the biggest issue at the forthcoming European elections.\par \par \uc2 UKIP, which wants a five-year freeze on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , has harnessed public concern over the issue in recent years to boost its profile and bolster its argument for leaving the EU. Its growing support has forced both Labour and the Conservatives to take a tougher line.\par \par \uc2 The timing of yesterday\u8217\'20\'19s speech could not have been better for Mr Farage, coming the day after statistics showed a huge increase in net migration. The increase from 154,000 to 212,000 in the year to September undermined David Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s pledge to reduce the figure to 100,000 by 2015.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said that a massive over-supply of cheap labour in Britain was hurting \u8220\'20\'1Cordinary folk".\par \par \uc2 Asked to expand on his claim that he no longer recognised some areas of the UK, he said he and many other Britons felt uncomfortable when surrounded only by foreign languages. He described a train journey home from inner-city London to Kent, saying it was only towards the end of the trip that he heard English spoken in the carriage. \u8220\'20\'1CDoes that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes it does."\par \par \uc2 Yesterday\u8217\'20\'19s gathering in Torquay was billed as an opportunity to show off a new, more professional UKIP. The maverick MEP Godfrey Bloom, blamed for ruining UKIP\u8217\'20\'19s autumn conference, stayed away. The party has urged activists not to engage in \u8220\'20\'1Ccranky" behaviour that would distract from its core message.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, the day was not without incident. The first blip came when it emerged that a new slogan unveiled on the conference stage \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1CLove Britain, Vote UKIP" \u8212\'20\'14 was almost identical to one previously used by the British National Party. Mr Farage sought to shrug off the parallel, but it was awkward given the party\u8217\'20\'19s efforts to distance itself from the far-Right group.\par \par \uc2 A further flashpoint came at a fringe debate on Sharia when a conference delegate stood up and asked the panel: \u8220\'20\'1CHow can you be both a Muslim and an Englishman?" He was shouted down and told by the party\u8217\'20\'19s culture spokesman, Peter Whittle: \u8220\'20\'1CThat we absolutely reject . . . We are absolutely in favour of a multi-ethnic society."\par \par \uc2 UKIP hopes to use May\u8217\'20\'19s elections as a springboard for the general election campaign next year. Mr Farage said he would consider it a failure if he did not secure a representative in Westminster. Asked if that meant he would resign, he said: \u8220\'20\'1CGood Lord yes." UKIP later insisted that the remark was a joke.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140301ea310010a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 What a tangled web \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2  has woven in her attempt to escape her tainted past.\par \par \uc2 In recent days, this paper has exposed the damning links in the Seventies and early Eighties between the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), a sinister pressure group that campaigned to legalise child sex, and the radical Left-wing organisation the National Council of Civil Liberties (NCCL), for which Harman was the high-profile legal officer.\par \par \uc2 As public pressure mounted over the Mail's revelations, Harman finally took to the airwaves to defend herself. Bristling with indignation in a BBC2 Newsnight interview, she refused to show a shred of remorse over the fact that the Paedophile Information Exchange was formally affiliated to the NCCL.\par \par \uc2 It was a remarkably disingenuous performance. I write that as someone who spent three years running her Parliamentary office, from 1989 to 1992 \u8212\'20\'14 an experience that led me to admire some of her qualities, such as her resilience, drive and energy. But on this issue, I am afraid she is being profoundly misleading.\par \par \uc2 For she has refused to acknowledge the disturbing reality that, in parts of the radical Left in Eighties Britain, there was a climate of opinion which held that paedophiles were an oppressed minority deserving support rather than condemnation.\par \par \uc2 That astonishing moral inversion was sickeningly illustrated by a Press release issued in March 1976 by the NCCL, which proposed that the official age of consent should by lowered to 14 and even be dropped to ten in cases where 'the consent of the child' could 'be proved'.\par \par \uc2 Just as disturbingly, the NCCL wanted to decriminalise incest 'when committed between mutually consenting persons'. Effectively, it wanted to legalise child abuse and depravity. In the dark world envisioned by this organisation, predators would have been able to act with impunity.\par \par \uc2 Patricia Hewitt\uc2 , the former Labour Cabinet minister who was General Secretary of the NCCL at the time, has now admitted: 'I got it wrong on PIE and I apologise for having done so.'\par \par \uc2 But her public contrition is in stark contrast to Harman, who has maintained all week that she has 'nothing to apologise for'. Hewitt now says that she and her colleagues at the NCCL were 'naive', but this saga was driven by something far worse than mere naivety.\par \par \uc2 It reflected an extraordinary political outlook which was partly fuelled by other liberation campaigns of the time, with their emphasis on sexual rights and their contempt for the constraints of traditional morality.\par \par \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2  might try to deny it now, but there was undoubtedly an ideological movement within the Left towards a toleration of paedophilia.\par \par \uc2 This helped to foster a deep moral ambivalence about child abuse, which was not only exploited by perverts, but also ultimately led to a string of appalling scandals, perhaps most infamously at \uc2 Islington Council\uc2  in the early Nineties \u8212\'20\'14 which was at the time run by Harman's close friend Margaret Hodge, now Labour MP for Barking.\par \par \uc2 The Left-wing roots of this movement can be seen in the creation of the Paedophile Information Exchange, which was founded in Edinburgh in October 1974 by two gay campaigners, Michael Hanson and Ian Campbell Dunn, both of them leading members of the Scottish Minorities Group, which later became the Scottish Homosexual Rights Group.\par \par \uc2 An outspoken, egocentric individual who worked as a town planner in Edinburgh, Campbell Dunn was a trade union official and Labour party activist. At one stage he was a local Labour council candidate, and, before his death, he had applied to become a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.\par \par \uc2 He publicly denied he was a paedophile, claiming he had become involved in PIE because he believed in supporting minorities. Yet he allowed his flat to be used as the mailbox for an insidious journal called Minor Problems, which billed itself as 'a radical review for free inter-generational and child sexuality'.\par \par \uc2 When this was exposed in the Scottish press, Campbell Dunn threatened to sue, but he quietly dropped the legal action after a tape emerged of his boasting about having sex with a 14-year-old boy. At his funeral in 1998, one young man turned up with the bitter words: 'I just came to make sure he was dead.' Explaining his anger, he said that he had been raped by Campbell Dunn when he was 15.\par \par \uc2 After its Scottish beginnings, the Paedophile Information Exchange moved to London, where it rapidly expanded in size, going up from 100 members in November 1975 to more than 250 in 1977. At its peak in the late Seventies, it had 450 members.\par \par \uc2 Some of this expansion reflected its gradual takeover of the extremist outfit the Paedophile Action for Liberation (PAL), which lobbied for the abolition of the age of consent.\par \par \uc2 Instead of cowering in the face of justified public opprobrium, the increasingly self-confident Paedophile Information Exchange went on the offensive to promote its cause. Part of its strategy was to link up with other Left-wing campaign groups. So it infiltrated the Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE) and, more importantly, joined the National Council of Civil Liberties.\par \par \uc2 And what is so striking about the NCCL at the time of PIE's affiliation is how many of its top officials went on to become major figures in the Labour Party or in civic life. As well as \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2 's husband Jack Dromey, who was chairman of the NCCL, the body's General Secretary was \uc2 Patricia Hewitt\uc2 , later a Labour Cabinet Minister.\par \par \uc2 There was also Henry Hodge, a solicitor, Labour Parliamentary candidate, and Islington councillor, who was elected chairman of the NCCL in 1974.\par \par \uc2 The husband of the aforementioned Margaret Hodge (the future Islington leader and East London MP, and now the influential chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee), Henry Hodge later became Britain's most senior \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  judge before his premature death in 2009.\par \par \uc2 Other key members of the NCCL in this period included its chairmen Bill Birtles (who married \uc2 Patricia Hewitt\uc2  and is now a High Court judge); barrister Peter Thornton (now Chief Coroner of England and Wales); Catherine Scorer (who worked as a trade union legal officer); and Larry Grant (who became an adjudicator at the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Appelate Authority).\par \par \uc2 Executive members included: Tony Smythe (later head of the mental health charity MIND), Bernard Dix (a Marxist trade union leader), Anna Coote (subsequently a think-tank adviser), Jo Richardson (who became a Labour MP), Tess Gill (later a senior union officer and lawyer), the human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson (who has since defended \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  founder Julian Assange), one-time Communist Sue Slipman (later a quangos chief), Paul Boateng (who became a Labour Cabinet minister, then British Commissioner in South Africa and now Labour peer), and there was legal officer Howard Levenson (now a judge of the Upper Tribunal \u8212\'20\'14 a senior judicial appeals body).\par \par \uc2 It is, in short, an astonishing list of the Left-wing great and good.\par \par \uc2 'We thought we could manipulate the Establishment and find allies within it,' said the former PIE chairman Tom O'Carroll. Through the NCCL, he achieved a degree of success in that aim, at least within the Left.\par \par \uc2 In her Newsnight interview this week, \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2  downplayed the importance of the PIE affiliation in 1975, implying it was only a minor administrative matter, which the NCCL could do nothing to prevent.\par \par \uc2 Yet O'Carroll told Radio 4: 'Harman and Hewitt couldn't just kick us out, or they could but they didn't try. The reason was their careers in the NCCL depended upon them not rocking the boat too much.'\par \par \uc2 And indeed, Stephen Green, the Christian campaigner and author who conducted extensive research in the NCCL archives in the mid-Eighties, says that the initiative for affiliation actually came from the NCCL itself. According to his research, the NCCL officer Nettie Pollard, who worked in the organisation until the late Nineties, 'wrote a letter inviting the Paedophile Information Exchange to affiliate in 1975'.\par \par \uc2 Pollard, a militant lesbian and gay rights campaigner and a member of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality's executive, was a powerful voice in support of a more relaxed approached to child sex.\par \par \uc2 In 1980, she even helped Tom O'Carroll with the writing of his proselytising book Paedophilia: The Radical Case. Such support reflected her own belief that children are sexual beings and that Britain 'should eliminate harmful age of consent laws'.\par \par \uc2 The extreme nature of her views was highlighted in a 1993 feminist book to which she contributed a chapter. 'Far from being innocent and becoming sexual at puberty, it is now indisputable that everyone is sexual even before birth,' wrote Pollard. 'Babies often react sexually when being held, or in other moments of physical pleasure.'\par \par \uc2 This is the mentality of the woman who worked at the NCCL alongside Harman, Dromey, Hewitt and Henry Hodge in the Seventies and early Eighties.\par \par \uc2 The assertion that child sex campaigners had absolutely no impact on NCCL is further undermined by the annual report of the Paedophile Information Exchange for 1975/76 \u8212\'20\'14 now held in the British Library \u8212\'20\'14 written by its chairman Keith Hose, the predecessor to Tom O'Carroll. In this incriminating document, Hose openly boasts about how his involvement with the gay rights sub-committee directly influenced NCCL policy.\par \par \uc2 As he put it: 'Copies of our evidence were sent to the executive of the NCCL before their decision on their policy in this area was reached, and some of the proposals of the gay rights sub-committee were adopted.\par \par \uc2 'The section on paedophilia in the report would undoubtedly not have been as positive had it not been for our lobbying. Our report therefore had some effect on the NCCL.'\par \par \uc2 Such words reflect the ideological madness that had infected sections of the Left, presenting abuse as childhood freedom or a lifestyle choice. What Hose called 'positive' would have been described by most people as monstrous.\par \par \uc2 Fascinatingly, one contributor to a website that criticises police action against child pornography made this recent statement. 'I used to read Peace News (a pacifist journal) and I belonged to the NCCL. Many articles in Peace News and other libertarian/alternative journals were written in support of PIE's aims and children's rights.\par \par \uc2 'I think it is extremely important to remind today's fascistic Britain that things were very different then, and some people believed passionately in children's sexual rights, lowering the age of consent, opposing corporal punishment in schools and liberalising child pornography. Sexual rights were part and parcel of the children's rights movement.'\par \par \uc2 In this political culture, paedophiles were gaining a spurious form of credibility.\par \par \uc2 So Tom O'Carroll was invited to address an NCCL conference, and sat on an NCCL gay rights sub-committee alongside Nettie Pollard. When O'Carroll was finally arrested in 1981 \u8212\'20\'14 and later convicted \u8212\'20\'14 for conspiring to corrupt public morals, the NCCL expressed its outrage at the 'deplorable nature of the conspiracy charge used by the prosecution', to quote the words of \uc2 Patricia Hewitt\uc2  at the time.\par \par \uc2 In the group's official publication, The NCCL Guide To Your Rights, an address was provided for the Paedophile Information Exchange at Elgin Avenue in West London. This was, in fact, the base of Release, an ultra-liberal drugs charity that received funding from the Home Office.\par \par \uc2 (The question of whether PIE itself received government funding was raised this week by the Labour MP Tom Watson.)\par \par \uc2 During her appearance on Newsnight this week, Harman claimed that PIE had been pushed out by the NCCL by the time she was appointed legal officer. But this is hardly the case. PIE remained affiliated until 1983, a year after Harman left her post on her election as Peckham's MP. Indeed, her successor as legal officer, Marie Staunton, openly defended the affiliation in an astonishingly frank statement of September 1983, which reflected the continued hold of the sexual rights agenda.\par \par \uc2 'Unless something is unlawful, people should not be prosecuted for the opinions they hold. The NCCL is campaigning to lower the age of consent to 14. An affiliate group like the Paedophile Information Exchange would agree with our policy. That does not mean it's a mutual thing and we have to agree with theirs.'\par \par \uc2 Like so many others in this saga, Ms Staunton \u8212\'20\'14 now a CBE \u8212\'20\'14 has gone on to have an elevated public career, enjoying spells as the British director of \uc2 Amnesty International\uc2  and deputy director of Unicef in the UK, and head of the international charity \uc2 Plan International\uc2 . She is now chair of the overseas environmental charity Raleigh International.\par \par \uc2 Even though the Paedophile Information Exchange went into rapid decline from 1984, when two of its leading members were jailed, the propaganda in favour of child sex continued. Exploiting the language and dogma of the radical Left, supporters of paedophilic activity portrayed the law as an outmoded instrument of repression, similar to the institutionalised prejudices against women and gays.\par \par \uc2 That viewpoint was graphically illustrated in an extraordinary book entitled The Betrayal Of Youth: Radical Perspectives On Childhood Sexuality, published in 1986 and compiled by PIE activist Warren Middleton.\par \par \uc2 Among those thanked in the preface were, inevitably, Nettie Pollard of the NCCL, as well Dr Brian Taylor, a sociology lecturer of \uc2 Sussex University\uc2  and Dr Ken Plummer, of Essex University. Both these academics were involved in the drive for acceptance of paedophilia.\par \par \uc2 In fact, Plummer, the former head of the Sociology Department at Essex, where he worked for 30 years, openly stated that his aim with paedophilia was to 'humanise it, normalise it and politicise it'.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, in our post-Jimmy Savile times, we are far more aware of the consequences of paedophilia. Yet there are still some on the Left who are drawn to this dark world, as can be seen in the catalogue of cases of abuse in recent years by Labour councillors and activists.\par \par \uc2 For example, Stephen Carnell, a school governor and the agent to Labour MP Chris Bryant in the last general election, was jailed for three years after being caught with 12,000 indecent images and 450 films. And Peter Tuffley, a former aide to Labour Cabinet Minister Hazel Blears, was jailed in 2006 for grooming a 13-year-old on the internet.\par \par \uc2 There have, of course, been a large number of cases involving Tories and Liberal Democrats. But the two crucial differences are, first, that the Left likes to pretend that it has a monopoly on compassion and, second, that a pernicious creed of 'children's rights' underpins much of this activity. It is a creed that has its origins in the period when Hewitt, Harman and Dromey were at the heart of the NCCL.\par \par \uc2 PATRICIA HEWITT\par \par \uc2 NCCL general secretary 1974-83.\par \par \uc2 Former Labour MP and Minister for Women\par \par \uc2 Jack Dromey\par \par \uc2 NCCL executive member 1970-79.\par \par \uc2 Labour MP and shadow police minister\par \par \uc2 SUE SLIPMAN\par \par \uc2 NCCL executive member.\par \par \uc2 Led single parent pressure group and is now \uc2 NHS\uc2  quango boss\par \par \uc2 TONY SMYTHE\par \par \uc2 NCCL general secretary.\par \par \uc2 He later ran the mental health charity MIND\par \par \uc2 PETER THORNTON\par \par \uc2 NCCL chairman 1981-1983.

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 SUSANNA'S PAID PRICE FOR PUTTING FAME FIRST\b0\par\par\uc2 BY AMANDA PLATELL   \par \uc2 1,479 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Susanna Reid seemed to have it all. The glamorous BBC Breakfast presenter (now moving to front ITV's new morning show for a big fat fee) was one of TV's rising female stars.\par \par \uc2 That was thanks in no small part to her flirty performances on Strictly Come Dancing.\par \par \uc2 She had three young sons and, just as fortunate, a long-term partner, Dominic Cotton, who we were told was happy shouldering the burden of caring for the little ones while Susanah was busy chasing the limelight.\par \par \uc2 Now we learn life was not as blessed as it seemed. Reid's 16-year relationship appears to be over after Cotton advertised online for a new partner, informing perspective dates that he is 'currently separated' and that his 'best feature' is his 'bum'.\par \par \uc2 While I feel great sympathy for Susanna and her boys, I fear it's no surprise that her partner has sought companionship elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 To present BBC Breakfast, she travelled from London to Salford three days a week, leaving her family each evening, getting up at 3.30 am to do the show, then returning home in the afternoon \u8212\'20\'14 no doubt exhausted.\par \par \uc2 Add in the hours she devoted to training for Strictly and her appearances in the touring stage version of the show, and frankly there could have been little time left to be a mother \u8212\'20\'14 let alone be a loving partner.\par \par \uc2 Now it seems it's Mr Cotton who's had enough.\par \par \uc2 It is a salutary lesson for all women that, however unfair, most men do not feel at ease living in a woman's shadow, least of all when she's so often absent. Precious few 'house husbands' are truly comfortable in the role.\par \par \uc2 Even in our post-feminist, progressive age, it is hard-wired into most men's DNA that even if they are not the primary earner, they do not relish being the primary childcarer.\par \par \uc2 It may not be right or fair, but it is human nature.\par \par \uc2 The result is that women face an impossible struggle to get the work-life balance right: to hold down fulfilling jobs, to care for their children and love their men.\par \par \uc2 Those who say they have found the perfect formula are usually deluding others \u8212\'20\'14 or themselves.\par \par \uc2 Susanna once paid tribute to her partner, saying 'he's unrivalled as a parent. I can't even come close'.\par \par \uc2 No doubt. But however brilliant Daddy may be, he wants the mother of his children to be around, too. And as Susanna has found, there is a heavy price if you put fame before family.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 As the debate rages about getting more women into politics, consider the case of Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers.\par \par \uc2 Her pathetic handling of the 'comfort letters' to IRA terrorists and her mauling by John Humphrys on the Today programme yesterday was proof \u8212\'20\'14 if it were needed \u8212\'20\'14 that politicians should be promoted for ability, not their gender.\par \par \uc2 * David Cameron said he would slash net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , yet figures show it has soared, with a staggering 40 per cent increase in migrants from the EU.\par \par \uc2 The poisonous Lib Dem Vince Cable says this is a 'good thing'.\par \par \uc2 Since 76 per cent of people supported Cameron's pledge to reduce \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , I can only assume Vince means it's a good thing because it makes the PM look incompetent. Or perhaps he's lost what remains of his marbles.\par \par \uc2 * In a week that saw ten of his flagship academy schools taken over after failing \uc2 Ofsted\uc2  tests, you'd think Michael Gove would have more things to worry about than female genital mutilation.\par \par \uc2 Yet he has agreed to ensure all schools educate girls in awareness of the issue.\par \par \uc2 Given this hideous practice is restricted to a minority population, surely the majority of schoolchildren would be far better concentrating on learning the three Rs than FGM.\par \par \uc2 * SCOTLAND will lose the BBC if it goes independent, warns Culture Secretary Maria Miller.\par \par \uc2 So be it. But please can we let them have Jim Naughtie back?\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 How curious that Channel 4 News should choose Steve Coogan as their preferred guest to discuss the Paedophile Information Exchange scandal. Is he a campaigner against child abuse or an expert on paedophilia? No. Coogan's expertise lies in drug-fuelled sex and lap dancers. Oh, and a hatred of newspapers that seek to expose uncomfortable truths. He is fast becoming even more of a joke figure than his alter-ego, Alan Partridge.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday I was at an event for the Coming Home charity, which adapts houses for seriously wounded soldiers.\par \par \uc2 Ed Addington, who served with 2 Rifles, moved me to tears as he spoke about the need to give returning soldiers like him a home and a chance of a new life. Visit their website and buy one of their scented candles. It will make your home sweeter to come home to, and theirs: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.coming-home.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 www.coming-home.org}}}\uc2 . uk and click on to the shop link for the aromatherapy candles.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The mother of the 30-year-old Polish former sausage factory worker who is dating \u163\'00\'A3148 million Lottery winner Adrian Bayford insists her daughter (right) is not a gold-digger, but is simply working as his bodyguard.\par \par \uc2 Of course she is. But then I fear the one thing the barrel-chested multi-millionaire needs protecting from is his own gullibility.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Happily married Claudia Schiffer says she turned down a \u163\'00\'A31 million indecent proposal to sleep with an Arab prince.\par \par \uc2 Yet she reveals 'some other supermodel took it'. Proving that Schiffer's not only held onto her magnificent looks, but also to her catwalk cattiness, as the hunt is on to find out which of her former rivals DID accept the offer.\par \par \uc2 Who's your money on?\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Poor old Fergie just never stops trying. The former face of WeightWatchers has just spent 12 weeks in a boot camp in the Swiss Alps, running each day and sticking to a diet of blended foods to lose weight.\par \par \uc2 'I may have lost 30lb, but I want to help combat global obesity,' she said.\par \par \uc2 Strange how she's so reluctant to shed that great lump of lard she's still attached to \u8212\'20\'14 otherwise known as Prince Andrew.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Freebie-LOVING Cherie Blair was an honoured guest of the Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols, as he was installed as a Cardinal at the Vatican. Pictures of the event revealed Cherie had a large Louis Vuitton bag suspiciously stuffed to the gills at her feet. I trust it wasn't full of purloined holy water and rosary\u160\'00\'A0beads.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Pippa Middleton says she's been hurt by accusations that she has cashed in on her royal connections. Well, the truth can be painful.\par \par \uc2 Does she really think she'd have been paid a \u163\'00\'A3400,000 advance for her silly party book if she was just an ordinary Home Counties girl helping out at the family firm? A source from her former publishers said: 'Pippa's sales are nothing to celebrate.\par \par \uc2 'She was a superstar after the wedding, but even Sarah Ferguson sold more when \u160\'00\'A0she started her writing career.' Ouch, now that really must hurt.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 After days of silence, \uc2 Patricia Hewitt\uc2  finally apologised for how the \uc2 National Council for Civil Liberties\uc2  allowed itself to be linked to a paedophile organisation seeking to lower the age of consent to ten and to legalise incest.\par \par \uc2 We still await an apology from Labour's Deputy Leader, \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2 , who has obfuscated, dodged and dissembled over her role in this whole murky affair.\par \par \uc2 Her position is increasingly untenable, but what is even more bewildering is the continued unconditional backing she's received from Labour Leader Ed Miliband.\par \par \uc2 As they say, a fish rots from the\u160\'00\'A0head down.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 * So the romance between Shane Warne and Liz Hurley is over after he was spotted heading off to the hotel suite of lingerie entrepreneur \uc2 Michelle Mone\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Warne insisted that the story was 'ridiculous and laughable' \u8212\'20\'14 before promptly jetting out of the country.\par \par \uc2 No doubt Liz didn't find it quite so hilarious.\par \par \uc2 * LUCKILY, when Victoria Beckham took time out of her catwalk schedule to visit children suffering with Aids in South Africa, she took along world-famous celebrity snapper Annie Leibovitz to capture her every move.\par \par \uc2 Well intended, I'm sure, but I can't be the only one cynically thinking a baby clothing line is on the way.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 I never thought I'd say this, but what a pity Susanna Reid did not follow in the footsteps of Natasha Kaplinsky, winner of the first Strictly. Say what you will about Spangles (and I have), but when the former primetime TV presenter became a mother, she cut down on her work schedule and put her family first. The result? Two children and a happy marriage. There's a lesson there somewhere.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140228ea3100064\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 IF HE FAILS TO WOO WHITE VAN MAN, DAVE'S SET FOR A CRASH\b0\par\par\uc2 BY SIMON HEFFER   \par \uc2 1,228 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 43\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Long before outspoken Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries accused her party's leadership of being 'posh boys', there were widespread concerns about whether \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and his political circle understood the lives of typical voters.\par \par \uc2 A new poll, claiming that 70 per cent believe the Eton and Oxford-educated stockbroker's son PM is 'out of touch', suggests the problem is far from solved.\par \par \uc2 This week we learned that five of the six people drawing up the Tories' election manifesto are Old Etonians \u8212\'20\'14 the sixth is George Osborne, who slummed it at London's elite St Paul's (where annual fees are as much as \u163\'00\'A331,000).\par \par \uc2 Entering this debate is the thoughtful Tory backbencher Robert Halfon, who represents the Essex town of Harlow. He wants the Tory leadership to work much harder to win the support of aspirational, hard-working people. Otherwise, he fears, they have no hope of winning the election.\par \par \uc2 They are a similar group of voters to whom I had in mind nearly a quarter of a century ago when I coined the phrase Essex Man.\par \par \uc2 Back then, they were people liberated from Socialism by Margaret Thatcher \u8212\'20\'14 treated for the first time as aspirational and economically enfranchised by being able to buy their own council homes.\par \par \uc2 Mr Halfon describes such values today as 'white van' conservatism.\par \par \uc2 The principles that this white working-class espouses haven't changed much since Mrs Thatcher's day: the wish to own their own home, to send their children to university and to keep more of what they earn rather than pay high taxes to fund a bloated state.\par \par \uc2 ThAT is why incentives must be offered by the Conservatives if they are ever to win back these traditional Tory voters.\par \par \uc2 The challenge is made more difficult by the rival appeal of Ukip. It wants to control \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , reclaim sovereignty from Europe, stop billions of pounds being squandered on overseas aid, create new grammar schools, cut taxes for low- earners, boost the Armed Forces and increase social mobility.\par \par \uc2 Once, most of these were Tory policies. But under Mr Cameron, priorities include giving taxpayers' hard-earned money to African despots as foreign aid and making same-sex marriages legal. The problem is so acute that one senior Tory MP told me this week that his constituency membership had 'evaporated' since last year, mainly out of anger over gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 Significantly, one of the party's former major donors, hedge fund manager \uc2 Michael Hintze\uc2 , has demanded repayment of a \u163\'00\'A32.5 million loan, because he is so unhappy with the same-sex marriage policy.\par \par \uc2 It is crucial that the Tories come up with a series of measures that appeal to millions of working-class people.\par \par \uc2 And that doesn't mean token patronising gestures, such as this week's suggestion to cut taxes on bingo.\par \par \uc2 One sensible way would be to offer voters an immediate referendum on Europe. Also, the Tories must do more (preferably through tax incentives) to encourage business start-ups and improve infrastructure in areas such as Tyneside and Lancashire.\par \par \uc2 And they should harness the entrepreneurial spirit and aspiration of the \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  communities of Northern and Midland towns and cities, and appeal to their deep sense of family values.\par \par \uc2 This strategy would be helped, too, if the Tories counter their socially elite image by making sure the voices of Yorkshiremen William Hague and Eric Pickles, and plain-speaking Liverpudlian Nadine Dorries, are heard as well as those of the 'posh boys'.\par \par \uc2 The men in white vans and their families are not yet fatally lost. But if the Tories remain deaf to their needs, they very soon will be.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 THE serious depletion of Britain's Armed Forces makes it much harder to run a foreign policy because potentially hostile countries know politicians don't have the force to back up their words.\par \par \uc2 America, too, this week announced a reduction in the size of its army to the smallest level since 1940. No wonder Russia is manoeuvring on Ukraine's borders and brandishing its fist.\par \par \uc2 The world is a dangerous place and what is happening in Ukraine should be a wake-up call.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 EVEN many in the Labour Party are admitting that Ed Balls's unpopularity among voters is a reason why Ed Miliband might struggle to win the next election. Now Lord Mandelson, who as an acolyte of Tony Blair once feuded with Mr Balls, feels he ought to endorse him as a fine Shadow Chancellor. Given Lord Mandelson's innate bad judgment, I suggest Mr Balls ought to start looking for a job outside politics.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 IT SHAMEFULLY mocks the rule of law that 187 suspected terrorists in Northern Ireland, some accused of the gravest crimes, should have been excused prosecution as part of the so-called peace process.\par \par \uc2 The public should have been told of this morally repugnant arrangement at the time.\par \par \uc2 This scandal further diminishes \u8212\'20\'14 if that is possible \u8212\'20\'14 the reputation of the Blair government, which seems to have wanted to present the 'triumph' of peace at any price, irrespective of what it involved.\par \par \uc2 Punishment beatings and knee-cappings continue to this day, and the gangsters have not gone away, concentrating now on drug-dealing.\par \par \uc2 The problems of Ulster, I fear, are not over, merely paused.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 I FIND it deeply demoralising that Lib Dem MP David Laws should have been rehabilitated with a government job despite admitting to an eight-year expenses fiddle worth \u163\'00\'A340,000. But to make matters worse, in his post as education minister, he now says grammar schools should reserve places for children from the poorest homes.\par \par \uc2 This is absurd: such schools should select pupils according to brains, not parental income.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The Left's use of the phrase 'child poverty' is highly emotive and is often a false measure of a child's true well-being.\par \par \uc2 Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is right to broaden the definition from meaning a household with an income of less than 60 per cent of the average.\par \par \uc2 He should also come up with an alternative and more objective term. Instead of talking about 'child poverty', we should speak about 'family deprivation', something that takes into account factors other than just income.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 SCARCELY a day passes without the Scots being told what will happen if they vote for independence.\par \par \uc2 There will be no currency union with England, no automatic membership of the EU, no BBC \u8212\'20\'14 and possibly no Eurovision Song Contest entry! Leading businesses, such as Standard Life, also say they might have to move over the border. These are almost unanswerable arguments in favour of the Union.\par \par \uc2 So, why does Mr Cameron think he needs to engage in absurd stunts to win over the Scots, such as holding a Cabinet meeting in Aberdeen?\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 JUDGE Keith Cutler outraged public decency by suggesting a 20-second silence before conducting the inquest into the killing by police \u160\'00\'A0of gun-toting criminal Mark\u160\'00\'A0Duggan.\par \par \uc2 This week, he appalled Britain by giving a derisory four-year jail sentence to a thug who killed a harmless man with a punch.\par \par \uc2 Though most judges are first-class, it is very hard to hold to account those who are out of touch with public opinion.\par \par \uc2 It is time to put them on five-year, renewable contracts.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140228ea3100069\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 THE CHAMBER OF HORRORS\b0\par\par\uc2 BY JERRY HAYES    \par \uc2 3,411 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 44\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Looking back on my days as a Tory MP in the Commons is like reflecting on my childhood. All the days seemed to be sunny and the characters larger than life.\par \par \uc2 But I'm sure that they genuinely were always far more interesting than today's lot \u8212\'20\'14 many of whom are pretty vanilla.\par \par \uc2 People moan about the standard of behaviour in the chamber, but it's a teddy bears' picnic compared with the Eighties, when I started out as a Tory MP for Harlow in Essex \u8212\'20\'14 a constituency I represented until 1997.\par \par \uc2 Back then, there was plenty of aggressive, alpha-male stuff \u8212\'20\'14 much of it from those who had actually fought hand-to-hand in the war. Today's bunch weep to the Press if another Member so much as frowns at them. And the men are as bad as the women.\par \par \uc2 So, where are the big beasts now? On the Tory side, apart from \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , George Osborne and Theresa May, the nearest contenders are Eric Pickles and Michael Gove.\par \par \uc2 Labour has more of a problem. Ed Miliband still hasn't quite found his voice, and Ed Balls is probably the one big beast they have left, though he's been wrong on just about everything.\par \par \uc2 But none compare to the characters I encountered during my time in the Commons, whose antics were often as outrageous as they were entertaining.\par \par \uc2 My dust-up with Tebbit\par \par \uc2 One of the golden rules in politics is that those who appear to be rather nice often aren't, and those who seem ferocious are rather engaging. Two names come to mind: Dennis Skinner and Norman Tebbit.\par \par \uc2 Labour MP Skinner is regarded by those who don't know him as a national treasure. In reality, he's a ghastly, bigoted, self-obsessed and probably the most unpopular man in the Commons.\par \par \uc2 But reading his press, you'd think he's an institution. And, in a bizarre unpleasant sort of way, I suppose he is. The sort of institution that requires its guests to wear jackets with buckles round the back.\par \par \uc2 What confirmed his copper-bottomed unpleasantness for me was an incident after the Brighton bombing in 1984.\par \par \uc2 John Wakeham, the Tory Chief Whip, had lost his wife and was horribly injured. Weeks later, the chamber was packed for a debate when the main doors suddenly swung open.\par \par \uc2 And there, standing on crutches, was a very frail John Wakeham.\par \par \uc2 Painfully, he hobbled to his place on the front bench. The debate came to a halt.\par \par \uc2 In one movement, the House rose in respectful silence for the courage of a man who'd suffered so much. Well, all of us stood save for Skinner, who sat scowling in his place. What a revolting little man.\par \par \uc2 On the other side of the coin is Norman Tebbit \u8212\'20\'14 another man who suffered terrible personal loss at the bombing.\par \par \uc2 He was a rottweiler in the chamber, and nicknamed the Chingford Skinhead by Labour leader Neil Kinnock.\par \par \uc2 But actually, he's a nice guy, with a twinkle in his eye and a great sense of humour. Although we did have a little falling-out.\par \par \uc2 Just after the 1987 election, I walked to the House on a beautiful day with a spring in my step. As I entered the Members' cloakroom, an enormous bulletproof limo glided to a halt outside.\par \par \uc2 A gothic gloom descended and Conservative Party chairman Norman Tebbit, with a smile like the brass plate on a coffin, marched in.\par \par \uc2 'Morning, Norman. Lovely day, mate,' I smiled.\par \par \uc2 'What's so lovely?' came the curt reply.\par \par \uc2 'What's the matter?' I asked\par \par \uc2 'You, you c***. I saw you on the News At Ten last night. Asking for more money for pensioners and the health service.'\par \par \uc2 'But I was only being reasonable.'\par \par \uc2 At that, Norman came up close and started prodding me in the chest, giving me the full hairdryer. 'It's not your job to be reasonable. Your job is to unquestioningly support your leader and your party, in that order.'\par \par \uc2 And, with a snarl, off he strode.\par \par \uc2 A few years later, I was making a film for Newsnight. John Major was Prime Minister and the Amish wing of the party was causing him grief over Europe.\par \par \uc2 At that point, Tebbit made a speech of such stunning disloyalty towards Major that it would have led to summary execution in Zimbabwe.\par \par \uc2 Afterwards, he was surrounded by the usual dandruff-flecked ghastlies, who were in a state of damp-gusseted ecstasy over his words. I sauntered up and said: 'Unquestioning loyalty to your leader, eh? Who's the c*** now?'\par \par \uc2 It didn't go down well.\par \par \uc2 Enoch's war on snoring\par \par \uc2 For a few months, I shared a desk in the Commons library with Enoch Powell \u8212\'20\'14 a tiny, trim little man, with a strong Black Country accent and piercing blue eyes.\par \par \uc2 When Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister, he'd refused to have Enoch sit opposite him in Cabinet as he said that 'he had the eyes of a fakir'.\par \par \uc2 To me, Enoch was always studiously polite. But he didn't like to be disturbed. He had his own way of dealing with snorers in the library: he'd creep up behind them and bang two large books together. It always worked.\par \par \uc2 He also used to get rather irritated by the Commons barber, who was almost as lethal with a cut-throat razor as Sweeney Todd (and made me look as if I'd been hurled though a car windscreen). This barber never stopped talking, which annoyed Enoch.\par \par \uc2 On one occasion, the barber asked him what sort of haircut he'd like. The grim reply was: 'A silent one.' Although sometimes a little quirky and remote, Enoch had a dry sense of humour. Once, when I was travelling by train to speak at an Oxford Union debate, he happened to be in the seat next to mine.\par \par \uc2 We had a delightful chat and as we were walking in the direction of the Union a chanting mob could be heard. Poor Enoch had to put up with a lot of abuse, even though it was more than 15 years since his controversial Rivers of Blood speech warning of the perils of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Once one occasion we appeared on Any Questions together \u8212\'20\'14- protesters water-bombed us and the programme came off air for about ten minutes.\par \par \uc2 So I thought that a few words of encouragement were needed during our Oxford walk. 'I'm sorry you have to put up with so much abuse \u8212\'20\'14 it must be dreadful,' I ventured.\par \par \uc2 He smiled and simply said, in that lilting Black Country accent: 'If you listen carefully, you will hear that the abuse is aimed at you, not me. I'm off to dinner with some friends.'\par \par \uc2 And with that he raised his trademark homburg hat and disappeared into the night.\par \par \uc2 A punch from Prezza\par \par \uc2 I suspect John Prescott has a sensitive side; it's just that it is not apparent if you're a Tory, since he thinks we really are lower than vermin. It was probably being a steward on the cruise liners and having to serve Tory PM Anthony Eden and his ghastly braying entourage that gave Prescott his hatred not just of the policies but of the class.\par \par \uc2 But he did get his own back on a patronising Eden by 'accidentally' spilling scalding-hot soup on his crotch.\par \par \uc2 I often attempted to be jolly with Prescott but never succeeded in breaking through the barrier. Once, we both appeared (in different studios) on Radio 4's Today programme. I was being irritatingly jovial and gave Prezza a few playful metaphorical jabs on air.\par \par \uc2 I thought nothing of it until I bumped into him in the Members' lobby later.\par \par \uc2 With my legendary judgment and timing, I bounced up to him with a grin. 'Hi, John. That was a bit of fun this morning, wasn't it?'\par \par \uc2 All I can remember is a jab in the solar plexus and a low primal growl: 'You little Tory c***.'\par \par \uc2 And then Labour Chief Whip Derek Foster, grinning from ear to ear, and saying: 'Nice fellow, isn't he?'\par \par \uc2 Willie Whitelaw,\par \par \uc2 whisky fiend\par \par \uc2 At the start of the Aids campaign, I once found Willie Whitelaw, then Deputy Prime Minister to Margaret Thatcher, looking ashen-faced and forlorn, nursing a bucket of whisky in the Smoking Room. I asked him what the matter was.\par \par \uc2 His rheumy old oyster eyes looked up at me as he slowly shook his head as if ridding himself of a terrible memory. 'I've just spent an hour with Margaret,' he groaned.\par \par \uc2 'Well,' I said cheerily, 'grim, but not the end of the world.'\par \par \uc2 'Really? Not the end of the world? I was explaining to her what a*** sex was.'\par \par \uc2 I thought it best to leave him to his whisky. And, God, could that man drink. In the days when he was Ted Heath's Chief Whip, it was his occasional duty to rise and move: 'That this House do now adjourn.'\par \par \uc2 One evening, after a very good dinner, he misread the time and almost missed his cue. So he staggered to the Bar of the House, slurred the magic words and then collapsed in a heap.\par \par \uc2 Willie's idea of a light lunch was a bottle of champagne, a bottle of white, a bottle of red and a couple of large brandies.\par \par \uc2 When he had his first heart attack his doctor advised that he confined himself to one champagne before lunch. So he did. Just one bottle.\par \par \uc2 Willie also had a reputation for discretion. Very often in the Smoking Room, you could hear him booming to a minister: 'I want to tell you something in absolute confidence.'\par \par \uc2 To this day, I'm not quite sure whether this was a ruse to plant misinformation \u8212\'20\'14 or just that he had a very loud voice.\par \par \uc2 Denis really was a menace\par \par \uc2 Denzil Davies, the Shadow Defence Secretary under Neil Kinnock, had once been a Treasury Minister.\par \par \uc2 But sadly, his boss Denis Healey \u8212\'20\'14 then Chancellor \u8212\'20\'14 was a bit of an old bruiser and didn't like Denzil's rather mild Welsh manner. As for Denzil, he couldn't bear constantly being told by Healey that he was a t*** or a w***** or plain 'bastard'.\par \par \uc2 So, in the end, he got Healey to agree that they'd communicate via written memos rather than face-to-face.\par \par \uc2 It made no difference. As Denzil told me, Healey just used to scrawl t***, w***** or bastard in the margins of all the memos.\par \par \uc2 Healey could also be one hell of a bully in the chamber \u8212\'20\'14 particularly when he locked horns with Michael Heseltine. This would happen late at night, when everyone had been drinking.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes, it almost got physical, with Healey \u8212\'20\'14 an enormous presence and a former beach master at the D-Day landings \u8212\'20\'14 aggressively shouting at Hezza to sit down, adding 'you bastard' more sotto voce.\par \par \uc2 A Major peas protest\par \par \uc2 When he first became Prime Minister, John Major was a little star-struck. 'Well, now you're Prime Minister, you can have dinner with whomever you want,' he was told.\par \par \uc2 'Really? Even Joanna Lumley?' he asked. His wish was her command. Bless her, she came.\par \par \uc2 I once had lunch with him when Spitting Image was endlessly repeating a sketch of him eating peas off the end of a knife.\par \par \uc2 When he arrived, there on the table was an enormous tureen of peas.\par \par \uc2 'Oh God, not peas again,' he moaned. 'Don't they realise it's a joke? I can't stand the bloody things.'\par \par \uc2 Slipping Paisley a snifter\par \par \uc2 In his drinking days, the \uc2 Press Association\uc2  journalist Chris Moncrieff went to interview Ian Paisley. Clearly, Moncrieff must have smelt like a Guinness brewery, because the big man exploded.\par \par \uc2 And he point-blank refused to be interviewed by a man who had 'the devil's buttermilk on his breath'.\par \par \uc2 A few years later, an Ulster Unionist MP and I decided to set the big man up.\par \par \uc2 Over lunch, we told Paisley that we'd buy him the most expensive pudding on the Commons menu if we failed to make him laugh.\par \par \uc2 Well, he couldn't lose. So the prize pudding duly arrived and he got stuck in.\par \par \uc2 About five minutes into his pud, my chum, in fits of giggles, sniffed the air. 'Ian, I can smell the devil's buttermilk on your breath,' he said\par \par \uc2 Then I got a fit of the giggles \u8212\'20\'14 and we had to explain that the pudding he'd won was actually laced with about three liqueurs.\par \par \uc2 We looked apprehensively at the big man, but the expected explosion never came. Just a chuckle and then a booming laugh. But he never finished his pudding.\par \par \uc2 And despite the fact that I often had enough devil's buttermilk in me to make a rather large Satanic cheese, Paisley used to smile politely every time we met.\par \par \uc2 His abstinence was in sharp contrast to fellow Northern Ireland MP Gerry Fitt \u8212\'20\'14 a tremendous character, and also enormously brave.\par \par \uc2 He'd been bombed out of his Belfast home a few times and always returned. The final straw was when he fought off gunmen on the stairs.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Thatcher, to her credit,made him a life peer and he came to London. At Westminster, Gerry was a prodigious drinker, rarely seen without an industrial-sized gin and tonic in his hand.\par \par \uc2 When he sat on the Commons terrace, he'd wave to passing Thames pleasure boats, raising his glass with the salute: 'It's all free!' (Sadly, it wasn't.)\par \par \uc2 If he wasn't on the terrace, he could be seen with his long-suffering armed detective, chugging along the river in his own little boat, gin and tonic in hand, entreating us to join him.\par \par \uc2 Gerry insisted his detective match him, drink for drink. As the man was packing a weapon, he politely declined but agreed to join him drink for drink with tonic water.\par \par \uc2 A few weeks later, the detective was rushed to hospital. It took a while for the consultants to work out what was wrong.\par \par \uc2 It was an unusual condition: quinine poisoning as a result of an overdose of tonic water.\par \par \uc2 A good year for mistresses\par \par \uc2 Sir George Gardiner, a cadaverous old Right-winger, was one of Mrs Thatcher's earliest supporters and guardian of the True Flame of the Blessed Blue Shrine \u8212\'20\'14 otherwise known as the 1922 Committee, a group of Right-wing Tories. Actually, although we lived on different political planets, I rather liked old George.\par \par \uc2 We were having dinner one evening when I let it slip that it was my fortieth birthday. Suddenly, he became wistful.\par \par \uc2 'Ah, 40. That was when I had one of my finest mistresses,' he saidwith a sigh.\par \par \uc2 The day Fatty put his foot in it\par \par \uc2 I'm not sure how much he weighs, but were he the Aga Khan, who balances himself against a ray of gold and diamonds every year (God knows why), Nicholas 'Fatty' Soames would be a very wealthy man.\par \par \uc2 Being the grandson of \uc2 Winston Churchill\uc2  mercifully hasn't given him airs and graces. He sees the world and its problems pragmatically \u8212\'20\'14 but he does have his delightful moments of innocence.\par \par \uc2 In Eighties \uc2 BBC\uc2  recording studios, the sound man always needed to test the 'level', so he'd ask guests what they'd had for breakfast, and adjust the sound accordingly.\par \par \uc2 One of Nick's earliest broadcasts went like this. 'For the level, Mr Soames, what did you have for breakfast, sir?'\par \par \uc2 'Oh, some cold grouse and half a bottle of breakfast claret. What about you, old boy?'\par \par \uc2 Once, Soames came into the Commons Smoking Room, rather ashen-faced, and sank a large gin and tonic.\par \par \uc2 'I'm afraid I've done something quite unforgivable,' he wailed.\par \par \uc2 He'd just received a delegation of single mothers and had been rather sniffy about feckless women.\par \par \uc2 'Feckless, Mr Soames?' said one. 'We are all Falklands widows.'\par \par \uc2 The poor fellow was utterly mortified.\par \par \uc2 Downsizing the Heseltine way\par \par \uc2 After his resignation over the Westland helicopters affair in 1986, I bumped into Michael Heseltine at a party conference, and he offered to give me a lift back to my hotel.\par \par \uc2 As we were walking towards the exit, he was accosted by a pack of journos.\par \par \uc2 'What's it like not being in the Cabinet, Mr Heseltine?' was the deeply insightful question.\par \par \uc2 'Well, I do miss my ministerial car,' he said sadly.\par \par \uc2 Then he led me off to a magnificent limo, bristling like a porcupine with aerials \u8212\'20\'14- and far, far grander than anything the government could provide. And he still had the same driver.\par \par \uc2 Not such a virgin train for Gordon\par \par \uc2 Once, the Labour leader \uc2 John Smith\uc2  was on a train up to Glasgow and found himself sitting next to Gordon Brown and a very rough-and-ready Glaswegian MP called Tommy Graham.\par \par \uc2 Tommy was a nice bloke but perhaps not a candidate for Brain of Britain. Put it this way: you weren't likely to drown in his gene pool.\par \par \uc2 The journey was coming to an end and, as Tommy hadn't been involved in the high-octane conversation between Brown and Smith, he felt he needed to make an impression.\par \par \uc2 As the train was pulling into Glasgow, he made an announcement. 'See tha fence over theeer?' he said in his impenetrable Glaswegian accent. 'Thass weer I shagged the missus for the feer taame.' And who said that the age of romance is dead?\par \par \uc2 Carry on in the cubicle\par \par \uc2 Dear old Ron Brown, a Scottish Labour MP, was affable but quite bonkers. His face was horribly scarred from receiving 5,000 volts in an industrial accident.\par \par \uc2 The word was that this had scrambled his brain. I remember coming back from a run and having a shower in the Members' changing room, then a rather Victorian affair with a tanning lamp that was built in the Twenties and looked as if it was on loan from Dr Frankenstein's laboratory.\par \par \uc2 Anyhow, as I was sluicing myself down, I heard gruntings and groans and then squeals of ecstasy. I looked in the end cubicle, and there was Ron indulging in what Private Eye used to call Ugandan discussions.\par \par \uc2 How Heath left Maggie seething\par \par \uc2 Ted Heath threw a party at the Savoy hotel to celebrate his 40th year in the House. The guests were glittering, the food and wine magnificent and an orchestra played discreetly in the background.\par \par \uc2 The only person not enjoying herself was Mrs Thatcher, who ousted Heath as Tory leader. Later, I pointed out to Ted that she seemed to be having rather an uncomfortable lunch as she was stuck between two people she loathed: Sonny Ramphal, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, and Bob Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury.\par \par \uc2 Ted's smile grew to a grin, his grin to a belly laugh and then those famous shoulders started to gyrate. 'That was rather the point,' he chortled.\par \par \uc2 Ruskies who came to the rescue\par \par \uc2 Following the 1983 election, Mrs Thatcher made Peter Walker \u8212\'20\'14 that consummate political operator \u8212\'20\'14 her Energy Secretary. He was the first Cabinet minister to invite backbenchers to lunch in his office. I mean a proper lunch, with decent booze, laid on by private caterers at his department.\par \par \uc2 Pretty young girls who'd been to finishing school served us, and Peter paid for everything out of his own pocket. Politically, this was a very clever move, as he was able to keep backbenchers up to speed with the miners' strike in private.\par \par \uc2 One day, he was a little late and insisted that he caught us up on the booze front. After a few drinks, he let slip that \uc2 MI5\uc2  had just told him they'd intercepted a container-load of cash from the Russians to support the miners' strike.\par \par \uc2 Peter said he'd insisted that the container should be allowed to get to Arthur Scargill's people. This rather confused us. Why, we asked.\par \par \uc2 'Oh, we did a deal with the Russians. They send money in fraternal solidarity to the NUM \u8212\'20\'14 and sell us cheap Russian coal so we can break the strike.'\par \par \uc2 And I thought I was pretty cynical.\par \par \uc2 * Extracted from An Unexpected MP by Jerry Hayes, to be published by Biteback on March 17 @ \u163\'00\'A316.99. \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Jerry Hayes.

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 FARAGE: I FEEL AWKWARD WHEN I DON'T HEAR ENGLISH ON THE TRAIN\b0\par\par\uc2 BY TAMARA COHEN    \par \uc2 613 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 NIGEL Farage yesterday said he felt 'awkward' when he could hear no English being spoken while on a train from London to Kent.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader described how he was on his way home when he went several stops without hearing his native tongue.\par \par \uc2 His comments followed a provocative speech in which he claimed some areas of Britain are being 'taken over' by migrants, while others have become 'frankly unrecognisable'. They came a day after figures showed a significant rise in net migration.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to journalists at his party's annual conference in Torquay, Mr Farage said: 'It was rush hour, from Charing Cross, it was the stopper going out. We stopped at London Bridge, New Cross, Hither Green.\par \par \uc2 'It wasn't until after we got past Grove Park that I could actually hear English being audibly spoken in the carriage. Does that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes.\par \par \uc2 'I wonder what's really going on. And I'm sure that's a view that will be reflected by three quarters of the population, perhaps even more.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage insisted he was not anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  but said Britain should be able to limit the 'quality and quantity' of migrants. While he denied wanting people to be forced to speak English, he said the challenge of integration was 'very, very important'.\par \par \uc2 Earlier, the Ukip leader attacked the main political parties for allowing 'open door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ' and said this was not the legacy he wanted to leave to 'our children and grandchildren'.\par \par \uc2 In his address to the 800-strong audience, he claimed he was leading a 'patriotic fightback' against the EU.\par \par \uc2 He predicted his party could win the European elections and pick up support in the local council elections, both in May. He even claimed he will have 'failed' if Ukip wins no Westminster seats at the General Election next year - and that he might resign if this happens.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said eight in ten British people believed unrestricted \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was 'irresponsible'. He linked it to a doubling of youth unemployment since 2004.\par \par \uc2 This has a 'social price', he added. 'The fact that in scores of our cities and market towns, this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognisable. Whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don't hear English spoken any more. This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren.'\par \par \uc2 The conference, with a large international media presence, was blighted by a gaffe in which a Ukip member asked: 'How can you possibly be a Muslim and an Englishman?'\par \par \uc2 He addressed the question to Ukip small business spokesman Amjad Bashir, and was told by officials that his views were not in line with the party's policy.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage was also embarrassed yesterday when it emerged his 'Love Britain, Vote Ukip' slogan echoes one used by the British National Party. It has promoted itself with 'Love Britain, Vote BNP' for several years.\par \par \uc2 BNP leader Nick Griffin accused Ukip of stealing 'our slogan and our policies'. Mr Farage tried to shrug off the association, saying people still fly the Union Flag which is also used by the far Right.\par \par \uc2 But the debacle is embarrassing given the lengths to which he has gone to distance himself from the BNP, including banning former members from joining his party.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  figures this week showed a large increase in net migration to 212,000 last year, most of it from debt-stricken southern Europe.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140228ea310006z\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Why such surprise at these soaring migration figures?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Douglas Murray   \par \uc2 929 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par 01:29\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 SCAREMONGERING! That was the accusation from certain quarters when this paper warned about further relaxing of EU border controls.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CScare tactics" they said, over warnings that lax border controls would mean an increase in the thousands of Eastern Europeans already coming to this country.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat happened to your migration wave?" they taunted in the first days of January when the whole of Romania and Bulgaria did not move to the UK in two days . How they sneered.\par \par \uc2 And yet the figures from the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  are in.\par \par \uc2 And once again it is those who have warned of an increase in the number of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who have been proved right and the sneering mass-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  lobby who have been proved wrong.\par \par \uc2 But none has been proved more wrong than the Government.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron promised to bring down net migration drastically.\par \par \uc2 Indeed the Conservative Party\u8217\'20\'19s online manifesto still promises \u8220\'20\'1Cto bring annual net migration down to the tens of thousands \u8211\'20\'13 rather than the hundreds of thousands we saw under Labour \u8211\'20\'13 by the end of this Parliament".\par \par \uc2 So how well is that going?\par \par \uc2 Not very, according to the new figures. Far from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  coming down it has soared in the past year.\par \par \uc2 And the numbers arriving from the EU went up most of all.\par \par \uc2 In the year to September 2013 net migration from within the EU rose from 154,000 the previous year to 212,000, despite the Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s spokesman saying this week it remained \u8220\'20\'1Cabsolutely the objective" of the Government to bring \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  down.\par \par \uc2 This rise in migration from within the EU is a massive blow to the coalition.\par \par \uc2 As it happens \u8211\'20\'13 and this is something for which the coalition ought to be applauded \u8211\'20\'13 migration into the UK from outside the EU fell again last year, down by almost 90,000 from two years earlier.\par \par \uc2 That is because this is an area that our Government can do something about.\par \par \uc2 And to give ministers credit they are trying to do something about it even though they are still far off their own targets.\par \par \uc2 But the real issue is that despite all the grandstanding they simply cannot fulfil their promise.\par \par \uc2 Because the largest cause of migration is at present beyond this or any other government\u8217\'20\'19s control.\par \par \uc2 And unless this country gets out of our current arrangement with the EU there is no prospect of us regaining control over our borders.\par \par \uc2 So the situation will only get worse.\par \par \uc2 After all we must remember that these new figures are only for the period up to September last year. That is \u8211\'20\'13 they are from before the opening up of Britain to anyone from the new member states of Romania and Bulgaria.\par \par \uc2 And as the Daily Express reported earlier this week the ONS figures show that 24,000 citizens from the two countries arrived in the year up to September 2013.\par \par \uc2 This presents an almost three-fold increase on the numbers \u8211\'20\'13 9,000 \u8211\'20\'13 who arrived in the 12 months before that.\par \par \uc2 Is there anybody outside of the major political parties who remains in denial of the fact that the figures for the present year are going to be many times that number?\par \par \uc2 Sadly these figures have already become a football for a political class that is incapable of dealing with this problem.\par \par \uc2 Prominent figures from the Labour party \u8211\'20\'13 which lost control of our borders utterly while in government \u8211\'20\'13 have seized the opportunity to criticise the Government\u8217\'20\'19s \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy Labour MP Keith Vaz has called the Government targets \u8220\'20\'1Ctotally unrealistic".\par \par \uc2 But far more infuriating for Conservative ministers must be the glee of some of their Liberal Democrat colleagues \u8211\'20\'13 who have actually welcomed these appalling figures. Senior Lib Dems have been saying that these figures are \u8220\'20\'1Cgood news".\par \par \uc2 Their glee will be shortlived because poll after poll shows that a vast majority of the British people want \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  brought down not just by a little but by a lot.\par \par \uc2 Any party which continues to argue for unalloyed \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  will rightly suffer at the ballot box. Because this is not primarily about the politicians but about us, the people.\par \par \uc2 And although politicians in favour of mass-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  forever praise its advantages the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  which is currently soaring brings more problems than it does benefits.\par \par \uc2 This is not just because of the strain on our schools and hospitals but because most of the migrants from within the EU \u8211\'20\'13 including 70 per cent of those Romanians and Bulgarians \u8211\'20\'13 are looking for work.\par \par \uc2 Many others are fleeing countries such as Spain which have been wrecked by the euro.\par \par \uc2 It is no fault of these \u8211\'20\'13 often young \u8211\'20\'13 people that they cannot find work at home.\par \par \uc2 But with one million young Britons unemployed here what is the sense in importing vast numbers who will make things even harder for our own young?\par \par \uc2 Of course some unemployed British people do not want to work but the vast majority do.\par \par \uc2 And their ability to find a paying job is undermined by each of these waves of migrants.\par \par \uc2 Any party truly wishing to sort this out must start by finally addressing the fundamental problem \u8211\'20\'13 that our borders are currently controlled not by Westminster but by Brussels.\par \par \uc2 There are elections coming up for the EU in May and for Westminster the May after that.\par \par \uc2 Those are the best two moments we have to tell our politicians finally that our concerns are not to be sneered at.\par \par \uc2 And they are not simply to be \u8220\'20\'1Clistened to". They are to be acted upon.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140301ea31001b9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 Will London always win?\b0\par\par\uc2 Alwyn Turner   \par \uc2 1,914 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph\par \uc2 DT\par \uc2 1; National\par 20,21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Ahead of a \uc2 BBC\uc2  documentary, Alwyn Turner charts the prickly relationship between our country and its capital\par \par \uc2 The yowls of anger and anguish were inevitable. When, earlier this year, Boris Johnson laid claim to the Beatles as part of London's heritage, he must have known he was \u8211\'20\'13 even by his own high standards \u8211\'20\'13 courting controversy. "They recorded their stuff in London and it was London that helped propel them around the world," he pointed out, and the protests were not confined to the group's native city of Liverpool. It was bad enough that London sucked in the wealth and talent of the country, many complained, without the perceived note of triumphalism to rub it in.\par \par \uc2 What made the outrage even greater was the fact that Johnson's argument was self\u8211\'20\'13evidently true. The all\u8211\'20\'13conquering progress of the Beatles depended entirely on them relocating to the capital in search of a record deal.\par \par \uc2 And the music they went on to make, despite its nods back to their childhood home, was shaped by the like\u8211\'20\'13minded people they encountered there. In 1965 The Daily Telegraph published an article headlined "London: the most exciting city in the world", and the myth of the Swinging Sixties was born. But no one believed it applied to the whole country. The following year Time famously gave its cover to the city and was quite clear that London was the only place that mattered in the world, let alone in Britain: "It swings; it is the scene."\par \par \uc2 Nor was there anything particularly new about the process. A century earlier, the Gateshead\u8211\'20\'13born singer George Leybourne had been discovered performing in Manchester; brought to London by a shrewd promoter, he developed a caricature of the metropolitan swell and, with the song Champagne Charlie, became the first true superstar of the music halls.\par \par \uc2 Back then, London had been in a phase of rapid growth, ending the 19th century with a population five times larger than it had been at its outset. Other cities \u8211\'20\'13 Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester among them \u8211\'20\'13 might have been growing by even greater multiples, but still they were dwarfed by the capital. The 1901 census showed that 18 per cent of Great Britain's population lived in Greater London, up from 11 per cent a hundred years before. Despite the driving force of the Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and North, nowhere else came even close to the numbers of London's huddled masses.\par \par \uc2 This was despite the minor part played by manufacturing in the city. Instead its role as the centre of the country's banking and trade, established in Elizabethan times, ensured its continued significance as the Empire grew. The building of the docks provided direct and indirect employment opportunities that resulted in a new influx of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from elsewhere in Britain and from the colonies. Jewish, Irish and Chinese communities were perhaps the most visible manifestations of London's expansion, but were far from being alone.\par \par \uc2 The pattern was well established. The story of Dick Whittington coming from Gloucestershire in the hope of finding streets paved with gold, and ultimately making his fortune in trade, dated from the 14th century. The popular version of that tale, first published in 1604, emphasised the rags\u8211\'20\'13to\u8211\'20\'13riches narrative and went on to be one of the great myths of Victorian pantomime.\par \par \uc2 Whittington effectively became the patron saint of the capital's newcomers, a symbol of what was possible.\par \par \uc2 In his footsteps came a wave of writers who were to cement London's cultural dominance. Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw.\par \par \uc2 They were not cockneys, of course, but all made their name in London and used the city as a springboard to international acclaim.\par \par \uc2 One of the charges laid against the capital is that, by attracting the talented and the ambitious, it has drained the rest of the country. In the Fifties, the Angry Young Men were celebrated for articulating the voices of the provinces, but the heroes of the literature, from Kingsley Amis's Lucky Jim to Keith Waterhouse's Billy Liar, dreamed of throwing off their small\u8211\'20\'13town shackles and escaping to London. This was the aspiration of the time, and the process has only accelerated, so that 58 per cent of the London workforce is made up of graduates, compared with a national average of 38 per cent.\par \par \uc2 For socialists, the answer to this imbalance could have been found in a redistribution of cultural wealth. But from its creation in 1946, the Arts Council has focused its money on the great institutions at the heart of the Empire. By 1965 Jennie Lee, then the arts minister, was pointing out that arts funding was skewed towards the capital, yet the situation persists. A report in 2013 found that for every \u163\'00\'A310 spent per capita in London by government on the arts, only 70p was spent elsewhere in the country. Even allowing for touring companies, that discrepancy was hard to ignore. Jim Hacker in Yes Minister once described arts subsidy as "a middle\u8211\'20\'13class rip\u8211\'20\'13off", but it's also possible to see it as a metropolitan rip\u8211\'20\'13off.\par \par \uc2 Behind these cultural manifestations is a long\u8211\'20\'13standing belief that London is also calling the shots in terms of the economy, with a concentration on financial services in the City at the expense of manufacturing. In vain, it appears, does London protest that it is the largest net contributor to the nation's reserves, in terms of income and corporation tax and of property charges: council tax is higher, and it accounts for a disproportionate element of stamp duty and inheritance tax. This, the city's detractors argue, only reflects the fact that it owns an unfair share of the country's wealth to start with. Every property boom in London further distorts the national economy.\par \par \uc2 A similar charge is made in politics. The current Government is seen as being out of touch with the electorate not merely because of the individual wealth of its members but also because \u8211\'20\'13 with due apology to William Hague and Eric Pickles \u8211\'20\'13 it is seen as being metro\u8211\'20\'13centric. So too is the Opposition. The choice is between Notting Hill and Primrose Hill. And even the fact that media reports assume such districts mean anything outside the M25 is a source of irritation; the only way a part of another British city can guarantee national recognition is to stage a riot.\par \par \uc2 London's dominance has contributed to the antagonism between the electorate and the governing class.\par \par \uc2 And in that gap Ukip has found room to grow: the party is regularly denounced as a south\u8211\'20\'13eastern, suburban, saloon\u8211\'20\'13bar operation, but it is certainly not the product of London.\par \par \uc2 Despite the standard shorthand of "London and the South East", the city has actually detached itself even from its geographical surroundings to become, along with New York and Hong Kong, a world city that transcends national origins.\par \par \uc2 Politically it is firmly to the left of its neighbouring counties, despite the celebrity endorsement of Boris Johnson as Mayor.\par \par \uc2 Again, this is not a new phenomenon. In 1971, Michael Palin visited friends in Guildford, Surrey, and noted in his diary: "They talked about 'London' as a descriptive term for all rather suspect, critical, Left\u8211\'20\'13wing, un\u8211\'20\'13British opinions." The image of the city as the home to what was becoming known as the liberal elite arose in the Sixties and has never quite been shaken off. The reforms that had characterised the second half of that decade \u8211\'20\'13 the abolition of the death penalty, the facilitating of divorce, the legalisation of abortion and male homosexuality, the outlawing of racial discrimination \u8211\'20\'13 had been achieved despite widespread public distrust. The result, according to Enoch Powell at the time, was a "gulf between the overwhelming majority of the country on the one side, and on the other side a tiny minority, with almost a monopoly hold upon the channels of communication".\par \par \uc2 The politician who argued that case most effectively was Margaret Thatcher, especially in her first decade as Conservative leader. "I'm a plain straightforward provincial," she explained.\par \par \uc2 "I've got no hang\u8211\'20\'13ups about my background, like you intellectual commentators in the South East." And the liberal elite \u8211\'20\'13 most notably those sections in receipt of state subsidy \u8211\'20\'13 responded with fury, attacking what \uc2 Jonathan Miller\uc2  called "her odious suburban gentility".\par \par \uc2 Yet it was during her premiership that the Big Bang facilitated the transformation of the City, local councils were diminished in status and the decline of the manufacturing North was accelerated.\par \par \uc2 Ideologically, Thatcher's greatest foe was not the trade union\u8211\'20\'13dominated Left, led (for want of a better word) by Michael Foot, which was already fading, but the new metropolitan Left that had emerged from those campaigns of the Sixties, symbolised by Ken Livingstone during his time as leader of the Greater London Council.\par \par \uc2 So provocative was the GLC that, using a sledgehammer to crush a nut, the Thatcher government abolished the authority altogether.\par \par \uc2 It was a short\u8211\'20\'13term display of power that failed to achieve its objective. Because while Thatcherism won the economic argument, Livingstone won everywhere else. In the Eighties, when he was being called "the most odious man in Britain", he was pilloried for advocating a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Northern Ireland, for demanding the Metropolitan Police change its approach to ethnic minorities, for providing pensioners with free bus travel. Who would have foreseen then a future in which a Conservative\u8211\'20\'13led government would legislate to introduce samesex marriages?\par \par \uc2 We're now living in a country shaped by Thatcherite economics and social and cultural Livingstonism, brought together by Tony Blair (another born\u8211\'20\'13again cockney) and continued by his self\u8211\'20\'13proclaimed heir, David Cameron. Or at least that's how London is. Following the banking crisis, the extraordinary growth of the Square Mile's financial industries has resumed, political and economic power is even more concentrated, and the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony sent out an unequivocal message: the green and pleasant land, transformed by the Industrial Revolution, is now defined almost solely by London. Even the \uc2 NHS\uc2  sequence of the spectacle was centred on \uc2 Great Ormond Street Hospital\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the eyes of the world, Britain is falling ever farther into the shadow cast by its capital city. The pop music that is exported comes from the BRIT School in Croydon or from the mind of \uc2 Simon Cowell\uc2 , the international stars \u8211\'20\'13 from Nigella Lawson to Benedict Cumberbatch \u8211\'20\'13 are disproportionately Londoners, Britain's best hopes for the Oscars are Steve McQueen and the special\u8211\'20\'13effects team behind Gravity. There seems no possibility of reversing the trend.\par \par \uc2 And perhaps the ultimate reason London is so resented is not simply that it holds all the economic, cultural and political cards, and then plays its hand with what is seen as haughty condescension. It is the nagging recognition that the rest of the country will ultimately be obliged to follow its lead, that London will always win. And, yes, that the Beatles did rely on the capital's infrastructure to succeed.\par \par \uc2 Alwyn W Turner is the author of A Classless Society: Britain in the 1990s, published in paperback in April (Aurum, RRP \u163\'00\'A310.99 + \u163\'00\'A31.35).\par \par \uc2 To pre\u8211\'20\'13order from Telegraph Books, call 0844 871 1514 or visit books.telegraph.co.uk\par \par \uc2 Mind the Gap: London vs the Rest is on BBC Two on Monday at 9pm\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140301ea310008y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 On a road trip through Napa and Sonoma, Sasha Abramsky observes the Silicon Valley set at play in a land of fine wine, boutique hotels and great American restaurants. Plus, further south, Celia Walden and Piers Morgan uncork the pleasures of Santa Barbara's vineyards\par \par \uc2 I view it as a sort of miracle," said Sir Peter Michael on the phone, when I asked him about the landscape surrounding his winery in Knights Valley, northern California. "You sit with a glass of wine in hand, looking at the sunset. It is absolutely stunning territory."\par \par \uc2 Days later, as my claret Nissan Altima hybrid \u8211\'20\'13 a fashionable choice, as I was soon to learn \u8211\'20\'13 came gliding to a halt in the parking area, I could see what he meant. His main office is a white shingle\u8211\'20\'13and\u8211\'20\'13timber building with a charming little bell tower poking up into a brilliant blue sky. Mount St Helena soars above deepgreen foothills ribbed with vines and, on hot days, eagles can be seen turning tight circles in the thermal currents.\par \par \uc2 I'd imagined this area of Sonoma County, an hour's drive north\u8211\'20\'13east of San Francisco, to be familiar and somewhat tame, a subtler twin to Napa County, with its faux chateaux and coachloads of wine tourists. But there is nothing tame about Sonoma. Wild and beautiful, it recalls the paintings of Gregory Kondos, with their sunbrowned valleys, curvaceous hills and expanses of water in exuberant Mediterranean blues. Deer congregate near the huge solar panels that provide the estate's energy.\par \par \uc2 And, where deer hang out, fearsome mountain lions hunt.\par \par \uc2 Brown bears are also known to frequent these hills, as do skunks, possums and coyotes \u8211\'20\'13 a who's who of the wildlife headliners of the great American West.\par \par \uc2 Sir Peter Michael is something of a headliner himself and, like California's natural wonders, is larger than life. A British technology venture capitalist, he discovered the beauty of Sonoma\u8211\'20\'13Napa in 1972 on weekend trips north from the California headquarters of his Quantel high\u8211\'20\'13tech company. In the early 1980s, he bought hundreds of acres and planted vines on what was originally cattle\u8211\'20\'13ranching land on the Sonoma side of the mountains. His aim was to create a world\u8211\'20\'13class winery and a family retreat for generations of Michaels to come. In both, he succeeded.\par \par \uc2 Back in England, his legacy is The Vineyard (see "Sonoma, Berkshire", page 35), a five\u8211\'20\'13star hotel with an exceptional collection of Californian wines. They come not only from the Peter Michael Winery but also from a select group of suppliers including Schramsberg, world\u8211\'20\'13famous for its sparkling wines, Charles Heintz, Honig and Rudd.\par \par \uc2 Most of these estates are open for tastings, though often by appointment only (see "How to live the Californian dream", page 35). Together, the wines in Sir Peter's cellars represent the cutting edge of Californian winemaking.\par \par \uc2 With The Vineyard as my unofficial wine concierge, I set off on a three\u8211\'20\'13day trip with a friend to experience the very best of the region's wine, food and lodgings. Starting from Sacramento, where I have lived for the past decade, we headed south\u8211\'20\'13west through Davis, Dixon and Vacaville to Fairfield. The colours became more extreme as we left the I\u8211\'20\'1380, one of America's great cross\u8211\'20\'13country roads, and drove west to the town of Napa itself. In late spring, the burned grass of the hillsides was as golden\u8211\'20\'13brown as a Van Gogh haystack, while the green trees and vines took on ever\u8211\'20\'13deeper hues.\par \par \uc2 The noises of urban life began to dissipate. It was an absence of sound that first struck me when we stopped for a capuccino at the Small World Cafe in Napa. In the window were dozens of model vintage cars, of the throaty sports and supercar variety. By contrast, many of the vehicles on the streets were muted. The Prius hybrid is the best\u8211\'20\'13selling car in California these days \u8211\'20\'13 and the higher an area's income, the more eco\u8211\'20\'13friendly the traffic.\par \par \uc2 In Napa, the Tesla electric car is more of a status symbol than a Rolls\u8211\'20\'13Royce, cruising silently past the salons and upscale clothing stores, the Quent Condair Fine Art gallery and Joey's Bakery, with its delightful cakes.\par \par \uc2 Half an hour after finishing our coffees, we were deep in wine country. Napa County has just four per cent of California's wine\u8211\'20\'13producing acreage, but it accounts for a third of the dollars generated by wine sales. Sonoma County is larger and its vineyards grow a wider variety of grapes. The scenery is more dramatic, the hills higher.\par \par \uc2 There is a sense of menace, almost, to some of its densely wooded slopes. Where Napa's broad valleys are sun\u8211\'20\'13drenched, Sonoma's are hemmed in by high hills. It is a mountain\u8211\'20\'13biker's paradise.\par \par \uc2 Most visitors come to Sonoma\u8211\'20\'13Napa not for the adventure sports but to eat in some of America's finest restaurants, including The French Laundry in Yountville, where reservations have to be made months in advance.\par \par \uc2 More accessible are the Michelin\u8211\'20\'13starred restaurant at the Auberge du Soleil resort, and Morimoto Napa, in the town of Napa itself, serving the delicate sushi creations of the chef and television star \uc2 Masaharu Morimoto\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Fine restaurants require fine wines, which the Peter Michael Winery has been happy to supply. Virtually every Michelin\u8211\'20\'13starred restaurant in America stocks the vineyard's cabernets, says sales manager Peter Kay, including the signature Les Pavots (see review, opposite), and several stock its pinot noirs and chardonnays, too.\par \par \uc2 That success is due to an extraordinary attention to terroir. Sir Peter's team measures variations in the mineral content of the volcanic soil, and the moisture, sunlight and wind to which different parts of his land are exposed, then plants the grapes accordingly. In Sonoma County, famous for its micro\u8211\'20\'13climates, planting a couple of thousand feet apart can result in very different conditions.\par \par \uc2 The result is a set of superior wines, with delicate variations in texture and huge aromatic shifts from label to label. One can practically smell, touch and taste the earth's varying qualities in each glass. Over lunch at the winery, Peter Kay chose wines to match our food. The first course, scallops, was accompanied by a La Carriere chardonnay. The second course, wild boar terrine, came with a glass of Ma Danseuse pinot noir, made from grapes grown on the estate's Ma Danseuse vineyard. Sir Peter named it as a love note to his wife, Maggie, whom he met at a dance school in Croydon in the late 1950s.\par \par \uc2 In the 1976 Judgment of Paris \u8211\'20\'13 a one\u8211\'20\'13off blind tasting competition organised by a British wine merchant \u8211\'20\'13 California chardonnays and cabernet sauvignons ran away with the top prizes, proving to the world that Californian wine had arrived. That was the year that Sir Peter, entertaining business associates at the Fairmont San Francisco hotel, tasted a top\u8211\'20\'13end \uc2 Chateau Montelena\uc2  from Napa and was hooked. Yet even today, relatively few Californian wines are sold in Britain \u8211\'20\'13 something the pioneering winemaker is keen to change. "Wine," he insists, "is social networking for civilised people; it is \uc2 Facebook\uc2  for those who want to have a life. The story begins in the vineyard, and after the bottle is opened, people tell their friends. The two greatest products to come out of the Golden State are technology and wine."\par \par \uc2 Our next stop was Schramsberg, the second\u8211\'20\'13oldest winery in California. Situated just over the hills, on the Napa County side of the mountains, it is set in a landscape of lily ponds and has a fascinating history. In 1862 Jacob Schramsberg, a German \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , planted a vineyard up in the hills. A few years later he hired unemployed Chinese labourers, left stranded by the completion of the transcontinental railroad, to hand\u8211\'20\'13dig a series of caves through the hillsides, in which to store his wines.\par \par \uc2 Fast forward 150 years and those caves, in which the pick\u8211\'20\'13marks of those labourers can still be seen, have been expanded. Inside are 2.7 million bottles of top\u8211\'20\'13notch cabernet sauvignons as well as some of California's best sparkling wines: an oenologist's Fort Knox. One sparkling wine, the 2005 JSchram ($210/\u163\'00\'A3130) was listed by the American Robb Report magazine as one of the top 18 wines in the world.\par \par \uc2 Since 1972, when President Nixon took several cases to China on his breakthrough visit to meet Chairman Mao, the brand has been a White House favourite. The Prince and Princess of Wales drank Schramsberg with Ronald Reagan in 1985; Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh shared a Brut Ros\u233\'00\'E9 with George W Bush in 2007; and the Obamas have served Schramsberg at a number of state functions.\par \par \uc2 Having sampled a few of the wines myself, I spent the night at Auberge du Soleil in the hills above the little Napa town of Rutherford. Its rooms, in adobe bungalow style, are scattered up the hillside; its landscaped gardens, planted with semi\u8211\'20\'13tropical flowers, are dotted with metal sculptures placed discreetly among the trees and shrubs.\par \par \uc2 One thing you notice in Napa County is an obsessive attention to detail, with an emphasis on absolute numerical precision \u8211\'20\'13 as befits a wineland so intertwined with the fortunes of high\u8211\'20\'13tech high\u8211\'20\'13flyers. At Auberge du Soleil, the pool is maintained at exactly 27 degrees. In the acclaimed restaurant, presided over by chef Robert Curry, $175 gets you an ounce, to the dot, of caviar.\par \par \uc2 My dinner there comprised lobster, a shot glass full of creamy fennel soup, halibut, squab (with a far from local Chateauneuf du Pape), steak pav\u233\'00\'E9 the rich purple of a Roman imperial toga, and dainty chocolate dumplings encircled by vanilla ice cream and drizzled with olive oil.\par \par \uc2 The great Californian essayist Joan Didion once wrote that "great hotels have always been social ideas, flawless mirrors to the particular societies they service". Auberge du Soleil's society is the \uc2 Google\uc2 \u8211\'20\'13and\u8211\'20\'13\uc2 Facebook\uc2  crowd \u8211\'20\'13 wealthy but casual, as reluctant to turn up for a $500 dinner in a jacket and tie as to show up driving a Rolls\u8211\'20\'13 Royce. They wear jeans and drive Subarus or Teslas, and they expect to be given a wine menu on an iPad, not on printed paper. At Auberge, they are not disappointed.\par \par \uc2 Next day we visited the Rudd estate, owned by the family behind the \uc2 Dean&DeLuca\uc2  deli chain. Its entrance is formal, wood\u8211\'20\'13panelled and old\u8211\'20\'13worldly, but underground all is modern. The cellars are antiseptically clean, lined with concrete and containing smooth, giant concrete eggs in which some of the wines are fermented.\par \par \uc2 Visitors pay $80 for a food\u8211\'20\'13and\u8211\'20\'13wine tasting that often includes produce from the Rudds' own gardens. In those gardens stand eight ancient olive trees, each brought by helicopter from Humboldt County, 200 miles away.\par \par \uc2 Rudd produces a terrific set of reds, including the noted Rudd Oakville Estate Red (see review, page 32), but my favourite was Samantha's Cabernet Sauvignon, named after proprietor \uc2 Leslie Rudd\uc2 's daughter. Having just been shown around the estate by Samantha, it seemed only polite to have a drink in her honour.\par \par \uc2 The final winery on my list was the Honig estate, a casual, family\u8211\'20\'13run affair noted for its environmental sustainability. The Honigs don't use fertilisers or pesticides, and instead rely heavily on bringing in birds to eat pests that threaten the vines. In German, Honig means honey \u8211\'20\'13 hence the bee logo on the estate's bottles. My favourite here was a dessert wine made from sauvigon blanc grapes, grown near the Napa River and affected by the botrytis fungus which lends the wine a delicious honeysuckle flavour.\par \par \uc2 It would be the perfect partner to foie gras, said winemaker Stephanie Honig, our host.\par \par \uc2 On our final evening in Napa County, we stopped in the town of St Helena. It was far too hot to go hiking in the hills, too hot even to stroll through town. We passed half an hour sampling olive oils out of shot glasses at Long Meadow Ranch, including the pricey but delicious Prato Lungo, made from olives grown on ancient trees and, with its peppery kick, ideal for dipping bread in before dinner.\par \par \uc2 That took place at Solbar, the Michelin\u8211\'20\'13starred restaurant at Solage Calistoga. They seated us outside, next to a long fire pit and opposite an Olympic\u8211\'20\'13size pool ringed by palm trees. I ordered salad followed by duck confit, with yet another fine local cabernet. Dessert was an over\u8211\'20\'13the\u8211\'20\'13top bread pudding, with a dolphin\u8211\'20\'13shaped scoop of vanilla ice cream and an apple crisp on top.\par \par \uc2 My friend looked up. "That's Joe Montana," he said quietly. And it was. There at the table next to us was America's most famous footballer. We raised our glasses and toasted wine country. It was time to head back to the real world.\par \par \uc2 Bon Voyage (0800 316 0194; bon\u8211\'20\'13voyage.co.uk) is offering a five\u8211\'20\'13night stay in California from \u163\'00\'A35,995 per person.\par \par \uc2 The price includes return Virgin Upper Class flight from London Heathrow to San Francisco, b&b accommodation at Auberge Du Soleil for three nights, and at Solage Calistoga for two nights, plus transfers, tours and tastings at the Schramsberg, Honig and Rudd wineries.\par \par \uc2 ART OF THE STATE\par \par \uc2 Ultratravel's pick of the finest Californian wines\par \par \uc2 Schramsberg 2010 Blanc de Blancs\par \par \uc2 This 100 per cent chardonnay sparkling wine is a White House favourite, offered to guests by Presidents from Nixon to Obama.\par \par \uc2 It opens with fresh aromas of green apple, pineapple and ripe grapefruit, with nuances of fresh\u8211\'20\'13baked brioche and lemon tart.

But bathing in Californian cabernet doesn't have quite the same effect\par \par \uc2 HE SAYS\par \par \uc2 My father has given me only two pieces of advice in his life: "Always be nice to policemen" and "Drink the best French wine you can afford". I have focused considerable energy on nurturing both tips for the past 48 years, successfully maintaining both my liberty and a high\u8211\'20\'13grade Bordeaux and Burgundy\u8211\'20\'13enhanced palate.\par \par \uc2 American wine has never held the same allure. It can be very good, but never quite as good as its French counterparts. The same applies to its cheese, fashion sense and gun laws. But that brilliant movie Sideways made me at least want to try to be persuaded. So Celia and I drove the 90 minutes from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara, where it was filmed, for a weekend of self\u8211\'20\'13indulgent barrel\u8211\'20\'13guzzling.\par \par \uc2 Everything in Santa Barbara, you quickly discover, revolves around wine. They produce it, drink it, enthusiastically debate its merits, and even scrub you in it here. I'm not sure what Utopia looks or feels like. But I now know what it smells like. My wife arrived back from her spa treatment at the enchanting El Encanto hotel, exuding a strong aroma of the delicious pinot noir she had been massaged in. "A magnificent vintage!" I exclaimed, unfortunately forgetting that the only time Celia wants to hear the word "vintage" is when she is shopping for clothes.\par \par \uc2 Tucked up in the hills overlooking this quaint little city, the El Encanto is an oasis of high\u8211\'20\'13class serenity. Our suite was spacious and well equipped, and the service friendly and efficient. Our meals, whether scrambled eggs and smoked salmon in bed for breakfast, fresh oysters by the infinity pool for lunch, or dinner in the absurdly romantic candle\u8211\'20\'13lit, sea\u8211\'20\'13view terrace restaurant, were consistently good. But I viewed the hotel merely as a very pleasing port in a storm of alcohol. On the second day, we drove an hour into wine country, to a family\u8211\'20\'13run winery called Grassini.\par \par \uc2 It was a spectacular journey through miles of vineyards (Sideways saw the number of winemakers in the area rocket), until we arrived at our location, a delightful wooden winery tucked away in an area appropriately named Happy Canyon.\par \par \uc2 Grassini produces more than 2,000 bottles each harvest, and the family samples every single one, then grades them into four categories to sell to the public. We tasted each of the four, over a sumptuous lunch by the vineyards, then had a surprisingly fascinating tour of the winemaking process.\par \par \uc2 Later that day, I took our daughter Elise to Santa Barbara zoo, where she out\u8211\'20\'13stared a gorilla, giggled with the giraffes, and ran away from a roaring lion. Then Celia and I spent the evening sampling a few fun bars down by the sea. But everything here eventually comes back to the wine. Before we left, Celia went for a second pinot scrub and came back with lust in her eyes. "Sorry," I said, sadly, "but I think you're corked."\par \par \uc2 SHE SAYS\par \par \uc2 Wine has always been the leitmotif of my relationship with Piers. I was wooed with magnums of Chassagne\u8211\'20\'13Montrachet, rendered limp and compliant by a fine Gevrey Chambertin on the night of our engagement, and kept in a lightly soused state by my husband for the whole first year of our marriage presumably in order to delay the inevitable "Oh God what have I done?" moment of sobriety.\par \par \uc2 Then I got pregnant, moved to LA, became a mother none of which are conducive to heavy drinking and took a break with the wine. Which is why wandering around the grounds of El Encanto in Santa Barbara (possibly the only city in California where wine is considered a pleasure not a moral and ethical violation) in a bathrobe and waffle slippers, with a glass of pinot noir in my hand, feels like coming home.\par \par \uc2 It helps that I stink of wine. That every pore on my finely exfoliated body is exuding a rich cabernet\u8211\'20\'13like scent, and that my hair smells like it has been rinsed through with pinot grape elixir, which of course it has. I've just had the pinot and cabernet crush sugar\u8211\'20\'13scrub at the hotel spa which I recommend doing after an afternoon at the vineyards.\par \par \uc2 When I say "vineyards", I mean "vineyard". Piers, who has the attention span of an ADD\u8211\'20\'13affected gnat, did his usual thing of asking our ebullient tour guide, Matt Cooper of Coastal Concierge, "What's the best one to see if you could only see one?" (He does this in museums, too, to the obvious consternation of the staff.)\par \par \uc2 So off we went to the Grassini Family Vineyards, where we sampled a whole series of merlots and petit verdots over a sumptuous picnic lunch. Spitting out the wine, I'm glad to find, isn't done here, which is why, when we're driven back through "Happy Canyon" to the hotel, we're both feeling pretty damned happy. It's a state only heightened by a brisk 50 lengths in the infinity pool overlooking the Pacific, an hour\u8211\'20\'13long scrub and vinotherapy massage, and more pinot, along with a cheese plate, on the terrace of our luxury suite.\par \par \uc2 By eight o'clock I am so pinoted\u8211\'20\'13up that my husband is just a blurry, full\u8211\'20\'13bodied shape extended in front of the flat\u8211\'20\'13screen TV on the California king\u8211\'20\'13sized bed. "Sorry," he grins, "but I think you're corked." Frankly, I don't know what is sadder: that he interpreted my pie\u8211\'20\'13eyed gaze as libidinous or that he has spent the past 48 hours thinking up that line.\par \par \uc2 Piers Morgan and Celia Walden were guests of El Encanto (0845 077 2222; elencanto.com) in Santa Barbara, California. Prices start at \u163\'00\'A3316 per night, based on two sharing a Superior Bungalow.

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Exclusive interview\par \par \uc2 What is it like to be the husband of \uc2 Amy Chua\uc2 , notorious for her savagely strict parenting? And why is their new book, The Triple Package, proving so controversial? Law professor Jed Rubenfeld tells all to Judith Woods\par \par \uc2 HAT does a human doormat look like? WA bystander in his own family? The sort of father who abdicates responsibility for the excesses of his wife's extreme parenting?\par \par \uc2 It's fair to say he looks nothing like Jed Rubenfeld, husband of \uc2 Amy Chua\uc2 , whose controversial 2011 book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother sent shock waves the length and breadth of the planet.\par \par \uc2 Sitting in a Manchester hotel, so jet\u8211\'20\'13lagged from his New York flight that he knocks back not only his own strong coffee but mine too in a matter of minutes, Rubenfeld is very much his own man. Tempted though I am to call him The Tiger Mother's Mate, I think the better of it rapidly.\par \par \uc2 He is a tall, rangy 52\u8211\'20\'13year\u8211\'20\'13old with a attractive air of sardonic melancholy: "I'm familiar with the concept of happiness but I think that I'm constitutionally unsuited to it," he jokes, drily. At least I think it's a joke, but then again, maybe it isn't.\par \par \uc2 A brilliant professor of law at Yale \u8211\'20\'13 as is his wife \u8211\'20\'13 Rubenfeld bears a marked resemblance to the Little Miss Sunshine actor Greg Kinnear, who is also a past master of the deadpan one\u8211\'20\'13liner.\par \par \uc2 But for a very long time, Rubenfeld has kept his own counsel as his Tiger Mother wife was vilified and insulted, subjected to racist slurs and bombarded with death threats and anonymous messages expressing a hope that her children would commit suicide.\par \par \uc2 Chua's unflinching, often scurrilously funny account of how she chivvied, bullied and browbeat their two children into academic and musical high achievement saw her slated as a wicked pariah in the US, feted as a parenting prophet in Asia and regarded with shock, awe and no small amount of envy here in Britain.\par \par \uc2 The book was essentially a satire that misfired, if an international bestseller can ever be regarded as misfiring. Chua, with a string of worthy academic tomes to her name, unapologetically portrayed herself as a Tiger Mother harridan, who ruthlessly sacrificed her daughters' childhood in the pursuit of excellence, by way of cocking a snook at wishy\u8211\'20\'13washy permissive parenting.\par \par \uc2 Of their father there was no mention. Although himself an author, inter alia of successful novels including The Interpretation of Murder, which topped the bestseller list here in Britain, Rubenfeld's absence from his wife's narrative was noted, extrapolated and condemned \u8211\'20\'13 hence the "human doormat" charge.\par \par \uc2 So where was he while Chua banned sleepovers and television and playdates, introduced rotelearning and hours of music practice daily? Was he present when his wife threatened to burn elder daughter Sophia's toys or when four\u8211\'20\'13year\u8211\'20\'13old Lulu handed her mother a homemade birthday card, featuring a big happy face, only to be informed that it wasn't good enough and told "I reject this"?\par \par \uc2 "I was there, in real life and in the book," he says. "But I made Amy take out all references to me, because I didn't want to be a character in her memoir; I don't particularly like talking about myself or my family."\par \par \uc2 Despite the fact he would have incontrovertibly come across as the good guy? Or did Rubenfeld fear being caricatured as a powerless (for which read spineless) bystander?\par \par \uc2 He brindles with supressed irritation, then tells me a story.\par \par \uc2 "When Lulu was young, aged about five, she was supposed to learn a piano piece with both hands for the first time," he says. "She tried and tried and couldn't do it.\par \par \uc2 Again and again her mother made her stick with it and there was crying and shouting, and I took Amy aside and said, 'Let her stop, what you're doing isn't useful and it's not going to achieve anything'."\par \par \uc2 His wife wouldn't countenance backing down. More yelling and sobbing followed. Then, after 20 minutes, Lulu suddenly, mercifully had an epiphany and mastered the technique.\par \par \uc2 "Her eyes lit up, and in that moment she realised that even when she was sure she couldn't do something, it didn't mean she couldn't do it. And do you know what I learnt from this?"\par \par \uc2 That you are a much nicer person than your wife? To his credit, Rubenfeld smiles. Briefly. Reluctantly.\par \par \uc2 "What I learnt was that if I had let Lulu quit, she would never have had that much better experience of overcoming adversity. People think that I somehow "let" Amy rear the kids, but we were always on the same side.\par \par \uc2 "In the book Amy never mentioned the unconditional love she showed the girls, the rolling about giggling on the bed, the fun stuff," he says. "That was very much part of life, but she was writing a different sort of book."\par \par \uc2 Rubenfeld came into his own during the downtimes; it was he who insisted on the family bike rides and apple\u8211\'20\'13picking and water slides and \uc2 Yankees\uc2  games. In truth, Tiger Mother is more finely nuanced than the headlines would suggest and by all accounts Chua herself is a far cry from the Asian\u8211\'20\'13American Mommie Dearest figure she provocatively projected in the book.\par \par \uc2 And yet the incidents in the book all happened.\par \par \uc2 I wonder if the dynamic might have been different had they had two sons? Would The Tiger Mother's Matehave been quite as noninterventionist if one of his boys was so stressed he left teeth marks on the piano, as one of his girls did?\par \par \uc2 Rubenfeld pauses for a long moment, then grins, ruefully.\par \par \uc2 "That's very difficult for me to know \u8211\'20\'13 but I might have pushed them more in sports if they had been boys."\par \par \uc2 Nature, nurture; the interplay never ceases to fascinate, and indeed, unsettle. My hunch is that Rubenfeld and Chua come down firmly on the side of nurture, although his intellectual yet laissezfaire Jewish upbringing was the polar opposite of her highly pressured home environment, and they both ended up in the same Ivy League ivory tower.\par \par \uc2 Their common experience was as the children of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 ; Rubenfeld's parents emigrated to the US from Poland. Chua's family were Chinese Filipino. And it is that very success that has led them to collaborate on their latest book, The Triple Package: What Really Determines Success. If anything \u8211\'20\'13 and this is saying a lot \u8211\'20\'13 it actually manages to offend more people than Tiger Mother did.\par \par \uc2 It's a densely written, minutely researched, hugely inflammatory work that dares to ask questions such as: why do Jews win so many Nobel Prizes? Why do the children of poorly educated Chinese \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  excel so remarkably at school? Given he is Jewish and she is Chinese, they're on reasonably safe territory here.\par \par \uc2 More eggshell topics are: Why are Mormons running America's financial sector?\par \par \uc2 Quickly followed by, Why are Nigerian Americans doing better than Appalachian Americans? Alongside the groups that succeed are those who, by contrast, fail; a thorny issue in a country of heightened racial sensibilities, where, post\u8211\'20\'13cold war, China is perceived as the 21st century's most potent threat.\par \par \uc2 To this end, The New York Post has already lambasted The Triple Package as "a series of shock\u8211\'20\'13arguments wrapped in self\u8211\'20\'13help tropes... meant to do what racist arguments do: scare people." But Chua and Rubenfeld steer conspicuously clear of the word "race", preferring "groups" or "culture". Their premise \u8211\'20\'13 that can be equally applied in Britain \u8211\'20\'13 is that there are three traits that certain groups possess that lead them to succeed.\par \par \uc2 The first is a superiority complex, which is to say a feeling you and your group are exceptional. The second, paradoxically, is a feeling of insecurity which is expressed by a need to prove oneself. The third is "impulse control" or self discipline.\par \par \uc2 "These qualities aren't racially determined or the product of genetics," says Rubenfeld. "They are very often seen in the children of certain \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  groups, such as those from China and India, who are tremendously high\u8211\'20\'13achieving, both the US and Britain.\par \par \uc2 "But by the third generation that advantage can peter out as they are exposed to a Western culture where parents offer unconditional love which is severed from high expectation."\par \par \uc2 If Tiger Motherdom was about screaming in your daughter's face and calling her "garbage" and "fat", The Triple Packageis about instilling in every child a sense of extraordinary potential, which creates drive \u8211\'20\'13 but not entitlement, which begets complacency.\par \par \uc2 If this is accompanied by the strict understanding that said potential has not yet been reached \u8211\'20\'13 and Mummy and Daddy really won't love you as much as they could until it is \u8211\'20\'13 then all that remains is a massive injection of steely self\u8211\'20\'13discipline and ta\u8211\'20\'13dah! Your offspring might end up at Harvard like Sophia, or Yale, which has offered a place to Lulu.\par \par \uc2 Rubenfeld is aware, of course, that the flipside of a superiority complex is intolerance, just as inadequacy can breed resentment. Throw overarching self discipline into the mix and you're perilously close to the realms of the Third Reich.\par \par \uc2 "Our book isn't a celebration of the cultures that are way ahead in terms of average income and education, it's an explanation of them and a pretty honest one at that," stresses Rubenfeld. "If this is what it takes for people to get ahead in our hyper\u8211\'20\'13competitive economic world, is it worth the price we might have to pay?"\par \par \uc2 He rejects the idea that The Triple Package is a how\u8211\'20\'13to manual. That's his wife's territory. "If I were a single parent bringing up kids, they would be unemployed and probably unemployable," he muses. "I wouldn't dream of giving anyone parenting advice."\par \par \uc2 Perhaps not, I reassure him. But the bike rides and apple\u8211\'20\'13picking sound fun. And they won't leave teeth marks on the baby grand.\par \par \uc2 The Triple Package (Bloomsbury) is available from Telegraph Books for \u163\'00\'A316.99 + \u163\'00\'A31.35 p&p. 0844 871 1515 ; books.telegraph.co.uk\par \par \uc2 'If this is what it takes to get ahead in our world, is worth the price?'\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140301ea31000h8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw160\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2400\pichgoal600

Henry Reilly (below) has said parts of Northern Ireland have also become unrecognisable through \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and said he receives complaints that people cannot get jobs because of so many foreign nationals.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at the opening of his party's spring conference in Torquay yesterday, Ukip leader Nigel Farage claimed that "open door, mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 " had hurt the poorest in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Newry and Mourne councillor Henry Reilly, who will run for Ukip in this May's European elections said parts of Northern Ireland are unrecognisable because of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . "It's not as bad here but it certainly has the potential to get as bad," he told the Belfast Telegraph.\par \par \uc2 "There are small pockets over here from where we get complaints from people that they can't get jobs at all, \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  seem to be the priority.

Not changing it, keeping it for ever."\par \par \uc2 In a speech in Torquay, Devon, he railed against mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and bemoaned the lack of English spoken on London trains.

Mr Farage said his party forced \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  into committing to an in-out referendum on EU membership by 2017.

Soames, 54, brother of former Tory minister Nicholas Soames, gets a \u163\'00\'A3255,000 pension and is eligible for a bonus of up to 150 per cent of his \u163\'00\'A3850,000 salary plus shares worth double that subject to performance.\par \par \uc2 He was at the helm of \u163\'00\'A34billion FTSE 100 power supplier \uc2 Aggreko\uc2  for 11 years and joins an outfit with a market value half its size. Former boss \uc2 Chris Hyman\uc2  quit after it was accused of over-charging on contracts to tag criminals that led to a \uc2 UK Government\uc2  ban on new work.\par \par \uc2 Soames said: "The work that \uc2 Serco\uc2  does is important to the lives of millions of people and I believe we can find a way through to a bright future."\par \par \uc2 Aggreko chairman \uc2 Ken Hanna\uc2  described Soames as "a charismatic leader of men, very politically astute, with good strategic insight and leadership skills".\par \par \uc2 Shore Capital analyst Robin Speakman said: "We believe that \uc2 Serco\uc2 's reputation with clients and decision makers has just gone up two notches on the dial from zero. Mr Soames will be a very busy man for the next few years."\par \par \uc2 Serco\uc2  shares rose 49\u190\'00\'BEp to 460\u189\'00\'BDp, while those of \uc2 Aggreko\uc2  fell 70p to 1560p.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140301ea310003o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

It was a time where the country needed workers for its factories, foundries, and new public services in order to boost the postwar economy.

At midday, there is a live concert from Wigmore Hall, where the Nash Ensemble play some of his best-known chamber works, while at 1.10pm, Roy Howat joins Sara Mohr-Pietsch, above, and Tom Service to talk about Ravel's piano compositions and to play a couple of the composer's miniatures. The highlight is A Ravel Soir\u233\'00\'E9e (7.30pm), an evening of live music, guests and recordings of some of his last works including the Piano Concerto for the Left Hand and the Don Quichotte songs.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140301ea31000gx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw142\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2130\pichgoal600

It wasn't until after we got past Grove Park that I could actually hear English being audibly spoken in the carriage. Does that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes.\par \par \uc2 "I wonder what's really going on. And I'm sure that's a view that will be reflected by three quarters of the population, perhaps even more. "That does not mean one is anti \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , we're not anti \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , but we do absolutely believe we should be able to judge it both on quantity and quality."\par \par \uc2 In his earlier speech, he said: "The fact that in scores of our cities and towns, this country in a short space of time has become unrecognisable. This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."\par \par \uc2 Document EVEMAI0020140301ea310002l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw125\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1875\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Finance\par \b \uc2 To deal with more \uc2 immigration\uc2 , build fewer houses in the South East\b0\par\par\uc2 By Andrew Lilico   \par \uc2 879 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par 08:02\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Despite the Conservative Party's pledge to reduce net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  into the UK to the tens of thousands, in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10664667/Net-migration-soars-over-200000-despite-David-Camerons-pledge.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 latest data}}}\uc2  net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has soared to 212,000, up 60,000 in a year. The commonest objection to large amounts of net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is the "we're full" one \u8211\'20\'13 the thought being that Britain is a crowded island already with decaying infrastructure and the last thing it needs is even more pressure to absorb extra cars on the road, passengers on the trains, children in the schools or sick in the hospitals.\par \par \uc2 It is normal in such arguments to talk about the economic benefits of migration or the enriching of our cultures from those coming from abroad or the freedom of allowing people to move around the world, and compare it with the infrastructure challenges mentioned or the cultural challenges of absorbing large numbers of foreigners or the impact on low-paid British workers.\par \par \uc2 What is much less often pointed out is that the "we're full" argument applies only to a small portion of the UK. We can illustrate the point by contrasting the population history of different regions. The population of Englandwas 33 million in 1911, 39 million in 1951, and 53 million in 2011 \u8211\'20\'13 a rise of about 60 pc in a century. When we note that the rise is focused upon the South East, Birmingham and Greater Manchester, the sense of people in some parts of the country that the growth in population is overwhelming them can be understood.\par \par \uc2 But, by contrast, Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s population in 1911 was 4.8m and by 2001 was still just 5.0m (lower, in fact than in 1951). Even more extreme is the case of Northern Ireland, where the population was 1.65m in 1841, and only 1.69m in 2001.\par \par \uc2 For England as a whole the population density is 4 persons per hectare; in Greater Manchester it is 5; and in the South-East 4.5. But in Northern Ireland the population density is only 1.3 and in Scotland only 0.7 \u8211\'20\'13 barely a sixth of the population density of England.\par \par \uc2 Thus, much of the UK is not remotely full and has not experienced any material rise in population that makes \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  difficult to absorb. Indeed, many regions (especially Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of North-East and South-West England), would benefit significantly from having more population, not only for the familiar reasons of cultural excitement and diversity and work ethic that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  bring, but for the more brute reason that it would be good to have more persons.\par \par \uc2 More on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/tag/immigration/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \b immigration\b0 }}}\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ambroseevans-pritchard/100026618/whatever-your-view-on-eu-migrants-swiss-show-sovereignty-really-matters/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 EU migrants: sovereignty really matters}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/matspersson/100026608/eu-immigration-why-ukip-should-pay-close-attention-to-what-happens-next-in-switzerland/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Ukip should pay attention to Switzerland}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/matspersson/100026318/uk-natives-are-running-a-larger-deficit-than-eu-migrants-but-were-all-in-the-red/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 UK natives are running a larger deficit than EU migrants}}}\par \par \uc2 The challenge, of course, is how to get more population to live in the regions where population is low instead of where it is high. London, the South East and Greater Manchester are more densely populated because they are where the wealth and jobs and business opportunities are (and, incidentally, vice versa). One option might be to grant \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  leave to live and work in the UK provided they live and work in the lower-population density regions. Other countries make such "regional passporting" schemes work, so presumably the UK could as well.\par \par \uc2 But there is another kind of option here worth mentioning. We could simply refuse to grant permission to build more houses or more factories or more offices in the higher population-density regions. Over the past two decades, for all the complaints about planning restrictions, the surpluses of dwellings over households in London and the South East has risen \u8211\'20\'13 we've built properties faster than the population of households has risen. We could, instead, build fewer houses. That wouldn't immediately prevent the population in these regions from growing, because existing properties could be used with more dwellers. But it would result in property prices in London and the South East rising even faster, relative to the rest of the population, than they have done recently. The consequence would be, eventually, that it would become economically unattractive to live and work in the high-population density regions. That would drive more population and more business activity into lower-population-density regions.\par \par \uc2 We can think of this as the Market's version of regional policy. Many commentators note the failures of central government regional policies to stimulate adequate activity outside London and the South-East. But if we simply refused to allow extra dwellings or offices to be built there, the price mechanism would chase activity elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 Then we could welcome increased \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as the good-news-story it would be. Extra \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  into Northern Ireland, Scotland, and the South West and North East of England would address one of the key objectives of failed regional policies for decades. And all delivered via the price mechanism. Fancy that.\par \par \uc2 More by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/author/andrewlilico/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Andrew Lilico}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/andrewlilico/100026719/we-can-adapt-to-climate-change-or-we-can-try-to-mitigate-it-not-both/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 We can adapt to climate change, or mitigate it.

It's a very literal theme for Chinese film-maker \uc2 Wang Bing\uc2 , whose epic films (such as the 14-hour Crude Oil and The Ditch, pictured) convey the full scope of industrial activity. There's music too, as Test Department regroup to bring industrial site Dunston Staiths - a massive structure on the Tyne - back to life for a series of outdoor audio-visual events. sr\par \par \uc2 Various venues, Sat to\par \par \uc2 31 Mar, avfestival.co.uk/\par \par \uc2 Goldfrapp: Tales Of Us Nationwide:\par \par \uc2 No self-respecting music artiste indulges in mere music videos these days. Like Sigur Ros, Kanye West and Beyonce before her, Alison Goldfrapp (pictured) has taken things a stage further, producing a 30-minute short film to visually enhance her latest album, Tales Of Us (the film follows Goldfrapp's Performer As Curator exhibition at the Lowry). Co-written and directed by Lisa Gunning (who edited Nowhere Boy and Seven Psychopaths), the film of the same title illustrates five of the album's songs, each concerned with an individual. Expect sensual, monochrome mood pieces in the mould of Goldfrapp's heroes Bergman, Lynch and Antonioni. This one-off screening of the film, at cinemas nationwide, is accompanied by an "exclusive, intimate" live performance from the band, beamed via satellite from London's Air Studios. steve rose\par \par \uc2 Various venues, Tue, goldfrapp.com/film\par \par \uc2 Viva! Spanish & Latin American film festival Manchester:\par \par \uc2 The balance between Spain and its former territories has tilted during the 20 years this festival has been operating, to the extent that the Latin American contingent now dominates, with new movies from Cuba, Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia making up for a shortfall in Spanish fare. Comedies bookend the event: opener Days Of Vinyl (pictured) follows four Argentinian record junkies, while the second week's Tasting Menu doubles as a celebration of Catalan haute cuisine. There are darker shades in between, though,\par \par \uc2 as found in Peruvian post-apocalyptic sci-fi The Cleaner, Spanish disaster scenario The Last Days, and Mexican \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  drama The Golden Dream. sr\par \par \uc2 Cornerhouse, Fri to\par \par \uc2 23 Mar, cornerhouse.org\par \par \uc2 Cinema Made In Italy London:\par \par \uc2 Paolo Sorrentino's The Great Beauty was one of the biggest foreign-language hits of last year - and ought to have a good shot at an Oscar tomorrow. In the meantime, here's what the rest of Italian cinema\par \par \uc2 has been up to. Sorrentino's regular star, Toni Servillo, plays twin brothers in political farce Viva La Liberta (pictured). Meanwhile one of Sorrentino's inspirations, Federico Fellini, is celebrated in a new documentary by his friend Ettore Scola (entitled: How Strange To Be Named Federico!). Among the other recent releases (many accompanied by intros and Q&A sessions with their directors) you'll find films that deal with Syrian war survivors, transgender car mechanics, narcissistic young artists and Italian football at the very lowest level. sr\par \par \uc2 Cine Lumiere, SW7,\par \par \uc2 Wed to 9 Mar,\par \par \uc2 institut-francais.org.uk\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140301ea310000m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Liam Fox: What a vote for Ukip really means; Only a Conservative majority has any intention of forging a renegotiation of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s fundamental relationship with the EU\b0\par\par\uc2 By Liam Fox   \par \uc2 775 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par 18:30\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 One of the issues dominating Westminster is the future of Ukip. Current betting markets expect a strong showing from the party at the European polls on May 22. If Ukip should fail to impress, it would be a devastating blow to their electoral prospects. If they do well, many will point to the successes of previous minor parties that prospered in the Euro-elections only to fail at the next general election.\par \par \uc2 This could be dangerous complacency, especially for the Tories. Latest polling shows that some 45 per cent of Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s current support voted Conservative in 2010, with only 14 per cent having voted Lib Dem and 8 per cent Labour. How should the Tories respond? The first thing is to understand that it is unwise in politics to be defined by your competitors. The correct response is to set out a positive vision, clear philosophy and definable objectives.\par \par \uc2 It is also worth noting how different issues motivate different parties\u8217\'20\'19 voters. When it comes to the matters affecting the country and the proportion of voters who see each as important, Tory voters have \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at 64 per cent, the economy at 60 per cent and welfare reform at 34 per cent. Ukip voters have \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at 83 per cent, the economy at 49 per cent, and Europe at 36 per cent. These differences become more marked when asked \u8220\'20\'1Cwhat are the most important issues for your family?". For Conservative voters, the economy comes top with 53 per cent, health second with 36 per cent, and pensions third with 34 per cent. \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  drops way down the list on this measure.\par \par \uc2 For Ukip voters, however, while the economy still comes top at 43 per cent, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is a strong second at 40 per cent, with health third on 36 per cent. Clearly, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is a more important issue to Ukip voters.\par \par \uc2 If the Tories are to bring back enough of these voters to win an overall majority at the election, there needs to be a clearer narrative on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , stressing not only the need to restrict numbers, but also to determine which individuals, with what skills, enter our country. While Conservative policy has concentrated on getting down the net migration numbers, it is actual numbers that affect school places, housing and health. The Conservatives must ditch this statistical nonsense.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, even if numbers came down and all were economic refugees from Somalia, what has been gained? We need to control how many and who comes into Britain. That will help to ensure that we get the right kind of migration for our needs. On the economy and on welfare reform, there is a strong Conservative case to make. The economy is likely to strengthen further as the election approaches, and there\u8217\'20\'19s an increasing fear of progress being wrecked by Labour once again.\par \par \uc2 On welfare reform, voters seem increasingly convinced about the need to tackle the social and spiritual poverty that long-term welfare addiction produces. The Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s recent intervention on this will have reassured many wavering Conservatives.\par \par \uc2 But it is not simply a matter of policy \u8211\'20\'13 it is also a matter of attitude. Name-calling \u8211\'20\'13 the accusations that Ukip activists or representatives are \u8220\'20\'1Ccranks" or \u8220\'20\'1Ccrackpots" \u8211\'20\'13 is ill-advised and counter-productive. Many decent and patriotic people have been willing to consider flirting with Ukip. We should not insult their motivations by denigrating their voting choice. Rather, we should point out the unavoidable consequences of a vote for Ukip, particularly in the coming general election. For a start, only a Conservative majority will guarantee a referendum on the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , which so many of us want. Only a Conservative majority has any intention of forging a renegotiation of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s fundamental relationship with the EU.\par \par \uc2 Either \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  will continue as Prime Minister in 2015, or Ed Miliband will replace him. That will be the choice. In all my dealings with Nigel Farage, I have found him personable and reasonable. I share many of his aspirations for our country. But I do not believe for a moment that those considering voting Ukip really want to see a Left-leaning Socialist government led by Mr Miliband and Ed Balls.\par \par \uc2 It is not the actual vote for Ukip that matters, so much as the consequences of doing so. That is the real consideration voters will need to face up to in the year ahead.\par \par \uc2 Dr Liam Fox is Conservative MP for North Somerset\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140301ea31005hj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NEWS\par \b \uc2 Immigration\uc2  policy must change, says Liam Fox; Writing in the Telegraph, Liam Fox says Tories must change policy on \uc2 immigration\uc2  to win back voters from the UK Independence Party\b0\par\par\uc2 950 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par 21:45\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  must ditch the \u8220\'20\'1Cstatistical nonsense" of his \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy and adopt a radical plan to reduce the number of low-skilled migrants moving to Britain if he is to win back voters from the UK Independence Party, a former Cabinet minister says today.\par \par \uc2 Liam Fox, a former defence secretary, warns that the Prime Minister will be guilty of \u8220\'20\'1Cdangerous complacency" if he dismisses the threat to the Conservatives from Ukip.\par \par \uc2 He said that Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, was \u8220\'20\'1Cpersonable and reasonable" and that many of his views were shared by \u8220\'20\'1Cdecent and patriotic people".\par \par \uc2 Writing in The Sunday Telegraph today, Dr Fox, the standard-bearer for Eurosceptic Conservatives, urged Mr Cameron to show voters a \u8220\'20\'1Cpositive vision" for Britain or risk defeat to Labour in next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election.\par \par \uc2 The Tories should abandon their target to cut \u8220\'20\'1Cnet migration", and concentrate on reducing the number of low-skilled migrants and addressing public concern over the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on schools and health services, he said.\par \par \uc2 Without a \u8220\'20\'1Cclearer narrative" on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , the Conservatives would not win back enough voters from Ukip to achieve a Commons majority, he warned.\par \par \uc2 The Tory leadership has privately conceded that Mr Cameron has no hope of winning more seats than Mr Farage in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  elections in May.\par \par \uc2 Many inside the party also fear that there is no chance of Mr Cameron now delivering on his promise to reduce net migration to the \u8220\'20\'1Ctens of thousands", after figures showed the number of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  rose last year.\par \par \uc2 Dr Fox made the comments as a leaked letter emerged in which the leader of 34 Tory councillors in Guildford accused Mr Cameron of undermining the party\u8217\'20\'19s chances of winning the next election.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Mansbridge told Mr Cameron that the Tories were being \u8220\'20\'1Cplaced in an impossible electoral position through your government\u8217\'20\'19s policies". The letter was backed by councillors and was being passed to No\u8201\'20\'0910 by Anne Milton, a local MP and government whip.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Eurosceptic MPs warned that the Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cvacillation and procrastination" on whether to adopt a tougher anti-European policy would allow Ukip to take votes from Tories.\par \par \uc2 Bill Cash, who chairs the Commons EU scrutiny committee, said this could cost the party \u8220\'20\'1C50 or 60 marginal seats".\par \par \uc2 Dr Fox, who was Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s first defence secretary, issued his strongest warning yet to the Prime Minister that a radical change of direction was needed.\par \par \uc2 He said that \u8220\'20\'1Ccurrent betting" suggested that Ukip were favourites in the European polls on May 22.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf they do well, many will point to the successes of previous minor parties that did well in the Euro elections only to fail at the next general election. This could be dangerous complacency, especially for the Tories," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Tory response must not be to attempt to outflank Ukip from the Right, the former Cabinet minister writes.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe correct response is to set out a positive vision, clear philosophy, and definable objectives," Dr Fox said.\par \par \uc2 In particular, he calls for a radical new policy on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , moving away from the party pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands by next year, which looks ever more impossible to meet.\par \par \uc2 Figures last week showed that net migration rose by 58,000 to 212,000 in the 12 months to last September, with the increase due to more workers from the EU.\par \par \uc2 Dr Fox said Tories should win back voters who have switched allegiance by pointing out the \u8220\'20\'1Cunavoidable consequences" of a vote for Ukip.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf the Tories are to bring back enough of these voters to win an overall majority at the election, then there needs to be a clearer narrative on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , stressing not only the need to restrict numbers, but also to determine which individuals, with what skills, enter our country.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhile Conservative policy has concentrated on getting down the net migration numbers, it is actual numbers that affect school places, housing and health. The Conservatives must ditch this statistical nonsense."\par \par \uc2 In what will be seen as a coded criticism of the Prime Minister and his allies, Dr Fox calls for an end to the \u8220\'20\'1Cname-calling" and the accusations that Ukip activists are \u8220\'20\'1Ccranks" or \u8220\'20\'1Ccrackpots".\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron famously described Ukip as a party of \u8220\'20\'1Cfruitcakes, loonies and closet racists".\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron is also facing growing concern over the rise of Ukip from grass-roots activists outside Westminster.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to him, the leader of \uc2 Guildford council\uc2  said he feared the borough would lose its Tory majority for the first time in 12 years and that Mrs Milton would be defeated at the election.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Mansbridge said there was huge local opposition to the \u8220\'20\'1Cexcessive number of new homes" being forced on the area\u8217\'20\'19s green belt by government policy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe have lost many Conservative party members \u8212\'20\'14 indeed whole branches of the local association \u8212\'20\'14 due to various government policies, and Ukip won over 20 per cent of the vote in the local elections last year in Surrey," he said. \u8220\'20\'1C\b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2 , the EU and gay marriage are frequently given as reasons for this."\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives\u8217\'20\'19 manifesto for the European polls will be largely a restatement of existing plans, including the promise of a referendum in 2017 on Britain\u8217\'20\'19s membership of the EU.\par \par \uc2 The party has shelved plans to make reform of human-rights law the centrepiece of the European election campaign because senior figures regard this as a waste of a potentially popular reform.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140302ea31000rv\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Home Secretary Theresa May hits out at Cabinet colleague Vince Cable for celebrating huge rise in \uc2 immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 GLEN OWEN   \par \uc2 517 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2014\par 23:26\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

I do not agree,\u8217\'20\'19 writes Mrs May, before going on to complain: \u8216\'20\'18At the moment we are bound by the treaties that successive governments have signed. These mean we cannot impose formal \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  controls on EU migrants.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 She argues that Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s plans to claw back powers from Brussels prior to a referendum on EU membership in 2017 should be used as an opportunity to change European laws on migration. The Home Secretary wants new member countries to reach a minimum level of wealth before their workers are allowed to travel to the UK to find work.\par \par \uc2 Some 24,000 citizens of Romania and Bulgaria arrived in the year to September 2013 \u8211\'20\'13 nearly three times the 9,000 who arrived in the previous year.\par \par \uc2 Those numbers are likely to rise, as the statistics pre-date the lifting of border controls on Romanians and Bulgarians\u160\'00\'A0 on January 1.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cable, who is to the left of most of the Lib Dems, and Mrs May, who is on the right of the Tories, are both keen to establish their leadership credentials ahead of any potential contest after the 2015 vote.\par \par \uc2 In his provocative remarks last week, Mr Cable said: \u8216\'20\'18Actually, those figures are good news because the reason net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is going up is because fewer British people are emigrating and surely that\u8217\'20\'19s a good thing \u8211\'20\'13 people are getting jobs here.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18We are getting people coming in from Europe to fill jobs in our expanding labour market.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18This is further proof that any quota on migration, such as the one Conservatives are pushing, is unworkable and contradicts our aims of getting Britain back on its feet.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The row displays the widening gulf within the Coalition, particularly in areas where the parties are most determined\u160\'00\'A0 to \u8216\'20\'18differentiate\u8217\'20\'19 their policies from each other.\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140302ea31001eb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw59\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Observer New Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 Slavery: still a scar on the face of civilisation: BEYOND THE OSCARS\b0\par\par\uc2 1,125 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 March 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 38\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In the opening chapter of Twelve Years a Slave, first published in 1853, the protagonist Solomon Northup, a New York carpenter, violinist and free man - until tricked into brutal bondage - reports modestly: "It has been suggested that the account of my life and fortunes would not be uninteresting to the public."\par \par \uc2 He was right. Today at the Oscars, the film version of Northup's experience, already garlanded with awards, and directed by Steve McQueen, is nominated in nine categories, including best film, best director and best actor. Last month, at the Baftas, McQueen, a patron of the charity \uc2 Anti-Slavery International\uc2  took the opportunity of being presented with the prize of best film to make a point that he may well repeat in Hollywood if he wins today. "There are 21 million people in slavery as we sit here," he told the audience, adding that he hoped that in 150 years' time his film would not need to be made again.\par \par \uc2 At the current pace of change, that is an ambitious wish. This week, Mauritania, the last country to abolish slavery, initiates an anti-slavery programme, encouraged by the United Nations Commission for Human Rights. It includes more support for victims, a special tribunal and access to lawyers. "The train is certainly in motion," said Gulnara Shahinan, the UN special rapporteur on contemporary slavery. "As long as the will is there, the rest will follow in time."\par \par \uc2 The global challenge is that, too often, political will is absent or insufficiently robust to effect the kind of proactive action, practical support for victims and tough penalties on perpetrators that accelerate real change. Estimates of the number of people trapped in modern-day slavery range from 20 million to 30 million globally, although hard facts and strong data are elusive. Modern slavery is no longer sanctioned by governments but it remains ubiquitous and highly lucrative. According to the CNN Freedom Project in the US, the average price of a slave in 1809 (adjusted to today's value) was $40,000. In 2009, that had fallen to $90. Low overheads and a high return; human misery mined in the name of profit.\par \par \uc2 The extent of the misery is illustrated in the tale of 16-year-old Somila Tanti from Assam, told in the Observer Magazine today. A trafficker lured her at the age of 13 to Delhi from scandalously badly paid work on a tea plantation. He was paid pounds 250 by a couple who hired Somila as a maid. The trafficker then pocketed her monthly wages of 4,000 rupees (pounds 38). Somila is one of 18 girls from whom he made a regular income.\par \par \uc2 Between 2008 and 2012, 452,679 cases of child trafficking for domestic labour were reported in India. Only 0.6% of those reports led to convictions. Slavery today comes in a number of forms. It includes sex trafficking and "bonded labour", as seen in Qatar, with desperately poorly paid, badly housed non-Qatari labourers building facilities in preparation for Fifa's 2022 World Cup. They are trapped, even as their death rate rises, by the "debt" they owe to contractors who ferried them from countries such as Nepal.\par \par \uc2 Bonded labour also exists in the UK. Vietnamese people, for example, are brought to cannabis factories, forced to work to pay off impossibly huge transportation fees that brought them to this country in the first place.\par \par \uc2 Human Rights Watch\uc2  recently issued a report which claimed that the Thai fishing industry - the third largest exporter of seafood in the world - relied in large part on the "systematic and pervasive" use of forced labour. In other words, men from Burma and Cambodia trafficked into slavery. A Human Rights Watch spokesman said: "The biggest problem we've seen is that if people can't work, people aren't useful on board, they can be killed and thrown overboard."\par \par \uc2 Modern slavery is every bit as cruel, dehumanising and violent as the portrait painted in 12 Years A Slave. But with greater mobility, transparency and international institutions who could work in unison, it is unforgivable that it remains a crime largely hidden from view. At this rate, it might well be another 150 years before the scale of the horrors visited on so many to force them into labour is properly apparent.\par \par \uc2 There is a need for a much greater campaign of awareness to highlight how the denial of freedom for children and adults often supports our way of life. Twenty-first century slaves are put to work, for example, in making cheap clothes and toiling in the lucrative chocolate industry.\par \par \uc2 In the UK, according to the Home Office, while overall crime is falling, cases of human trafficking have seen a sharp increase. In 2013, there were 1,746 potential victims of trafficking, a 47% rise on the previous year. Albania, Nigeria and Vietnam headed the list of 112 countries from which potential victims were trafficked. Theresa May, the home secretary, has said that tackling slavery is her personal priority and the Modern Slavery Bill is due to become law in the spring. The bill consolidates and simplifies existing slavery and trafficking offences, increases the maximum sentence to life imprisonment and creates an anti-slavery commissioner. While welcoming the bill, Jakub Sobik, of \uc2 Anti-Slavery International\uc2 , has expressed justified concerns that the bill so far gives victims of slavery insufficient protection. For children, strong guardianship rights should be established in law to stop the pattern of trafficked youngsters removed to local authority care frequently going missing.\par \par \uc2 The bill, now in select committee, can be toughened. What also requires attention is the 2012 change to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  law that means an individual can bring an overseas domestic worker into Britain, but with a visa limited to six months and with the employee forbidden from seeking alternative employment. An enslaved domestic worker who overstays their visa and approaches the authorities for help could face deportation to a country in which they have limited resources and support. A victim protection clause is required in the legislation and an assurance that the anti-slavery commissioner is politically independent.\par \par \uc2 More than 200 years ago, William Wilberforce finally won the support of parliament at an important stage in his battle against slavery. "You may choose to look the other way," Wilberforce told the House of Commons, "but you can never again say that you did not know." In their own way, on an international scale, the unlikely pairing of Solomon Northup and Steve McQueen has again performed a similar deed in cinema. If modern-day slavery is to end, we cannot look away. We all have a role to play.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140301ea3200019\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer New Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 What's wrong with selling visas to rich \uc2 immigrants\uc2  at pounds 2.5m a pop?\b0\par\par\uc2 Will Hutton   \par \uc2 1,180 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 March 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 40\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It's time to make some serious money from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Britain could and should raise billions every year from the world's rich and skilled who want to live and work here. We should auction residential visas to the world's super-rich. We should top that up with swingeing fines on employers of illegal migrant workers. (We currently don't bother to collect what are only modest fines.) We could even auction some work permits.\par \par \uc2 We should spend the proceeds on a programme of house building, job creation and training for the young - focused on unemployment black spots. The message would be that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is beneficial and, by showing how, take some of the sting from the tidal wave of scapegoating and quasi-xenophobia that masquerades as honest-to-God Euroscepticism or freedom to speak the allegedly unspeakable. Far from not talking about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , we now talk about little else.\par \par \uc2 Along the way, let's expose Nigel Farage, the capo of the anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  brigade, for being a charlatan. He may not read his own manifesto, but on his next train from Charing Cross, instead of being distracted by fellow passengers who have the temerity not to speak English, he might try to read the analysis of Migration Watch.\par \par \uc2 The thinktank is hardly part of the liberal elite against whom the fulminating Farage rages. Rather, it is the very non-liberal campaigner against excessive \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and custodian of freezing Britain at somewhere around 1980. But Migration Watch does not argue for leaving the EU to solve the problem. Instead, it points out - surprisingly calmly - that net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  into Britain from the 15 original member states runs at a blameless 30,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 The recent EU influx has been driven by the new accession states from eastern Europe, although Migration Watch observes that even that is beginning to fall back to much lower levels. However, this will be offset over the next five years by a buildup of an expected 50,000 a year from Bulgaria and Romania - the main cause of last week's spike. But if they conform to the same pattern of going home, by the end of the decade net migration from the EU will be at manageable levels\par \par \uc2 The issue is the 300,000 or so non-EU migrants who come to Britain every year, with only 100,000 leaving. In the main, EU nationals go home after a spell working here. (And let's remember 100,000 Britons emigrate from Britain to the EU every year.) It is non-EU nationals who stick around and many of those benefit our economy and society - although it is hard to point to unambiguous ways.\par \par \uc2 One imaginative ploy was floated last week by \uc2 the Migration Advisory Committee\uc2 . First, Britain should double the pounds 1m we ask aspiring residents to invest in government securities as a condition of fast-tracked residency, and widen what they should invest in beyond simple government bonds. We should also create a category of around 100 "premium visas" that we should auction in sealed bids each year to the global super-rich - mainly Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern oligarchs - who want to come and settle here.\par \par \uc2 The committee suggests a reserve price of pounds 2.5m, of which pounds 2m would be allocated to investment assets, and a minimum pounds 500,000 should be donated to the government in a good causes fund. This could be disbursed to support anything from training to medical research. (Of course, these financial demands do not, and should not, apply to more regular applicants who must comply with strict requirements relating to work and pay, or the support of a family member.)\par \par \uc2 There were predictable protests from the solicitors and accountants acting for rich migrants who feared that an important business line would be threatened. I am with Sir David Metcalf, chair of the committee, who robustly dismissed all the carping, arguing that auctioning the visas was not demeaning, and infinitely better than doing what we do at present - in effect, giving them away. It is almost impossible to see what benefits Britain draws from these arrivals, who are only asked to buy gilts that we have no difficulty selling - a requirement unchanged since it was introduced in 1994. They might hire the odd chauffeur or buy a Dior suit, but the main consequence has been sky-high central London property prices. There was no evidence they are philanthropists; if anything, they make Scrooge look generous. Let's at least create a system that benefits the country.\par \par \uc2 The Metcalf proposals are intriguing. If the committee's recommendations are accepted it would create an instant minimum supply of at least pounds 1bn for investment in any security or asset class we chose to select as eligible - infrastructure "visa" bonds, "visa" bonds for small and medium businesses, or the Enterprise Investment Scheme.\par \par \uc2 The good causes fund would be a minimum of pounds 50m. But why not go further? Why not aim to create an annual good causes fund of pounds 500m, partly from auctioning residential visas but adding the proceeds from auctions for visas for "entrepreneurs" and from work permits? It could be topped up with fines on employers of illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . Suddenly, there would be the resources to reintroduce, say, the superb Future Jobs Fund to offer young people decent work experience which, with some combination of reduced national insurance contributions and ambitious public works programme financed by "visa" bonds, could see a real dent in youth unemployment numbers.\par \par \uc2 Any of this would have been possible at any time in the last decade. It is our failure to think straight, make good policy and implement it, caused in part by the political class's instinctive genuflection to the rich at home and abroad. Nor is membership of the EU the cause of our \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  ills, it is globalisation and the population flows it generates.\par \par \uc2 Into this vacuum has stepped an enterprising, saloon-bar zealot - Mr Farage, who says he is not anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  or anti-openness. But he has singlehandedly done more to stir anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , anti-openness sentiment than any recent politician. Let's just blame the EU, in particular, and \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , in general, for our self-made problems. As a result, the right of British politics is less secure on questions of race, openness, and tolerance than it has been since 1945 - and it is pulling the entire political discourse with it. Long-standing British virtues are under siege and at risk.\par \par \uc2 Practical responses are urgently needed, otherwise exit from the EU and de facto closure of our borders are real possibilities - an economic, cultural and moral disaster. Making serious money from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  won't reverse this, but it might tilt the balance - and perhaps buy some time while EU inflows subside. It's worth a shot.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Window-shopping in Knightsbridge is a popular pastime for wealthy foreigners.\par \par \uc2 Photograph by\par \par \uc2 Alex Segre/Alamy\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140301ea320001e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 No child dreams of growing up to become a pharmacist. They are never romantic leads or action heroes in films. As far as a search of my bookshelves and the web can tell, they are not the heroes and heroines of novels either. Doctors, detectives and spies are everywhere, while the ignored pharmacist is nowhere to be seen.\par \par \uc2 To become a chemist is to choose a comfortable existence. At Boots they make around pounds 38,000 on average. This money buys the kind of life the rich and the bohemian have always derided: the semi in suburbia with the spare room for the children; the annual holiday and the car on HP. It can sound dull until hard times fall on you or your society and you learn that ordinary achievements are not to be derided.\par \par \uc2 I wasn't surprised to learn that almost a fifth of pharmacists are Asian. It's a good career for second generation \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . Your parents work hard in a menial job or at a shop that's open all hours so that you can have better. You go to university and choose to study a subject that will bring you a secure middle-class future. Maybe a slightly dull future, but as your parents will tell you, there are worse fates than being bored occasionally.\par \par \uc2 The politicians chant that if you "work hard and play by the rules," they will respect you. But respect and security is hard to find in modern Britain even for such respectable people as pharmacists.\par \par \uc2 In 2007, Boots, once a solid Nottingham retailer, was bought by \uc2 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts\uc2 . The American private equity firm specialises in borrowing money to take over established firms, and then sweats the assets and restructures the firm to pay off the debt and take the profits.\par \par \uc2 Wall Street journalists of the 1980s called \uc2 KKR\uc2  "the barbarians at the gate" . Others called them worse. No one has ever said that they were dull. In 2012 \uc2 KKR\uc2  and their partners more than trebled their original investment of around pounds 1bn after selling 45% of their holding for pounds 4.3bn. They sold out to and cashed in with the American health chain, Walgreens. It doesn't appear to like trade unions or to want to deal with them. More to the point it has an option to further enrich the "barbarians" of \uc2 KKR\uc2  by buying its remaining stake in Boots.,\par \par \uc2 Profit-taking on this scale has economic consequences which are all around us. Because corporations sit on piles of money, and direct profits to executives and shareholders, the balance between labour and capital is out of joint. Profits don't lead to higher wages or new jobs in developed countries, where in the words of the International Labour organisation, "Almost everywhere, young people and women find it difficult to obtain jobs that match their skills and aspirations." Falling real wages and persistently high unemployment mean that economic recovery is fuelled by yet more debt and may sputter out, as even George Osborne fears.\par \par \uc2 Less examined are the intellectual consequences of the power imbalance. The notion that employers exploit workers has a precarious place when established society hails the executive or the dealmaker as the real wealth creator. Workers do not create, so they cannot be exploited. They are cost centres to be squeezed, when they are not being patronised.\par \par \uc2 If this sounds like radical language, consider the position of an upright group of men and women. Boots' private equity owners are so jealous of their profits and contemptuous, arguably, of their workforce that pharmacists must seek a change in the very laws of the land to get the bosses to talk to them.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, the Pharmaceutical Defence Association asked Boots if it would recognise it as a trade union. This was a mild demand, indeed no demand at all. We still have free trade unions in this country and rights to association are still regarded as fundamental liberties, although you would be forgiven for not knowing it. Pharmacists need them as much as everyone else. They are caught in a trap, which is closing on many middle-class people.\par \par \uc2 On the one hand, the law treats them as professionals who are personally liable for mistakes in prescriptions and diagnoses. If a patient is given the wrong medicine and suffers, it is their responsibility. On the other, the conglomerates who employ them treat them as staff, "proletarians," if I may use old-fashioned language, who must obey orders, even though if a mistake happens because the corporation has not given pharmacists the backup they need, the pharmacist rather than conglomerate pays the price.\par \par \uc2 Boots strung the Pharmaceutical Defence Association along, then pulled a trick on it. Rather than recognise the independent trade union, it said it would deal with a Boots staff association instead. \uc2 John Murphy\uc2 , the general secretary of the rejected union and a former Boots chemist, said that the staff association didn't challenge the employer or seek to negotiate or bargain collectively.\par \par \uc2 The adjudicators of the Central Arbitration Committee, an independent body which settles disputes, did not bite their tongues. Boots "had no intention of recognising the union," they said. It stalled so it could arrange a deal with the staff association. As a result there was no real union at Boots which had "collective bargaining rights for at least pay, hours and holidays", it continued, and this omission left the private equity capitalists in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.\par \par \uc2 Boots went to the courts to challenge the decision. The courts said Boots did not have to recognise the Pharmaceutical Defence Association under English law but told the union that English law could well be incompatible with the European Convention.\par \par \uc2 The judge invited the union to go to another court to seek a "declaration of incompatibility". If a fresh judge makes a declaration, then the government must consider legislating to make English law and human rights law compatible. All this just so pharmacists can have the right to raise legitimate concerns with their vastly rich and proud employers.\par \par \uc2 The crisis that the soaring growth of inequalities of wealth and power has brought can be glimpsed everywhere. You can see it in the inability of the young to afford an ordinary house in an ordinary street. You can see it in the vast levels of debt weighing down on ordinary working- and middle-class families, and you can see it at the Boots pharmaceutical counter, where chemists are treated like red revolutionaries just for wanting to negotiate with their employer as free men and women.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140301ea320001g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer Review Features Pages\par \b \uc2 in the: shadows: Contender: Yvette Cooper is one of Labour's most influential politicians. And yet her practised modesty and unshowy style have kept her out of the limelight. But cometh the hour, cometh the woman?\b0\par\par\uc2 BY RACHEL COOKE PORTRAIT BY ANTONIO OLMOS   \par \uc2 2,358 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 March 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PIty the woman politician who says anything at all in public, however mild, about ambition; it can't be much fun to open the newspapers and find out that you long for nothing less than to be prime minister (last week Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, told Total Politics she could see "nothing wrong" with being ambitious, only for this statement of the bleeding obvious to be reported as a sign of her urgent desire to move into No 10). But still, I can't help but feel that if a few more of them tried to be honest about their aspirations, it would make life a lot easier in the long run. Better, I think, to be likened to Lady Macbeth by the Daily Mail than to perpetuate the idea that ambition is a dirty word if you're female!\par \par \uc2 Take Yvette Cooper. The shadow home secretary will talk for as long as you'll let her about the more quotidian satisfactions of her job: the effect she can have on policy, or the lives of her constituents. But she'd rather die than admit she enjoys landing one on Theresa May's nose during their encounters across the dispatch box at Home Office questions. "Most of politics isn't shouting," she says, briskly. "It isn't even dramatic. It's practical. For me, there is nothing like it in terms of being able to think: this is really unfair, we must do something about it."\par \par \uc2 Even so, there must be something about politics in particular that appeals, given that she could doubtless do just as much good if she was, say, running an \uc2 NHS\uc2  Trust. "You can campaign from outside politics. But in the end, you're just trying to persuade politicians."\par \par \uc2 So she really doesn't relish the whiff of power? All she will concede is that the House of Commons is a crucial arena for the opposition, for only there can it put the government under "serious pressure".\par \par \uc2 We meet in Cooper's impersonal Whitehall office - she doesn't keep family photographs at work on the grounds that they only increase her guilt when she has to work late - a few weeks before yesterday's "special conference" at which delegates debated Ed Miliband's reforms to the relationship between his party and the unions. (Cooper, the daughter of a former trade union official, claims not to be anxious about the effect such a change will have on the party finances. "Most financing comes from individual members anyway," she says, neatly sidestepping the pounds 4m hit the party coffers are likely to take.) In person, she is smiley and attentive, gazing at me wide-eyed as I ask my questions - and this is pleasing at first. Most male politicians tend to interrupt or look bored. Fairly quickly, however, it dawns on me that what she's doing while I'm talking has very little to do with listening. Rather, she's busy formulating her spooling and distinctly robotic answers, most of which bear very little relationship to whatever it is that I've asked. It's like a comedy sketch. "What's your favourite cheese?" I will inquire. "Yellow," will come back the inevitable reply, followed by a long list of the colour's many virtues.\par \par \uc2 We start by talking about the mood in the Labour party. Cooper admits that it is odd knowing, for the first time in her political life, exactly when the election will be; it feels different. Can Labour win? "Well. . . I think we've got an opportunity to." This is hardly a ringing endorsement; all the parties, even Ukip, have this "opportunity". But perhaps she's worried about Ed Miliband's personal poll ratings, which continue to be poor? She shakes her head. "First, think where we started in 2010, with our lowest level of support for decades. Most people would have assumed the party would fall apart and start fighting itself. I would have expected it to have a very hard time. Second, to come back in one term is really hard. So what Ed has managed to do in a short period is incredible: hold the party together, build a stronger sense of unity."\par \par \uc2 What's his greatest strength? "I think he has shown that he gets it. There's an empathy with people. Probably the other thing is. . ." A pause. "He's prepared to stand up against some of the vested interests."\par \par \uc2 I wonder if the Labour party isn't expecting voters to have rather short memories. We know too much about the Blair-Brown wars, the infighting, the mistakes, the suspect briefings, thanks largely to a series of books by former cabinet ministers. (It's as if a wife were to hand her husband an account of all her affairs with the words: but we'll stay married, right?) And some of those involved - including Cooper and, especially, her husband, Ed Balls - were at the heart of all this.\par \par \uc2 Cooper laughs, slightly nervously. "When you're in government for 13 years, there will be things that go wrong. People will become angry. Iraq was difficult. We thought there were weapons of mass destruction. But what's the future? If the alternative is what \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and Nick Clegg are doing, it's devastating. Everything in the modern media has become more confessional. In any organisation there will always be disagreements. In the end, though, I think: what did we do that was worth doing? The \uc2 NHS\uc2  was transformed, we increased the number of people going to university, we provided free fruit in primary schools." I joke that fruit is considered to be sugar now, and therefore verboten. "Well, I'm going to stick up for the apple!" replies Cooper, with a sharp nod of her head.\par \par \uc2 I wonder about her memories of that time, though. The conversations she and Balls must have had of an evening. Did it feel like she was working in a lunatic asylum? "I don't think it did feel like that. Most of the time, as a junior minister, you're just worried that you've got to do an adjournment debate next week. You could think: why is so much time being wasted on these arguments? But any government needs strong figures, checks and balances. You do need internal debate."\par \par \uc2 Perhaps it's these "checks and balances" - ie a lot of bitching and shouting - that put some women off politics. In recent months, after all, a number of women MPs have announced they will stand down in 2015. What does she make of their loss, and why is she willing/able to keep going when they are not? "It is a challenge if you've got children. We in the Labour party did a lot to recognise the pressures on women with children, and we brought in women shortlists, too. \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2  in particular has been a fantastic champion; when I had problems with my maternity leave [as she has written, after the birth of her third child in 2004, civil servants treated Cooper's absence "with hostility"] she was incredibly supportive. I don't think the Tories have ever faced up to those issues. They've never done anything to get more women in parliament, and then [once they're elected] it's just sink or swim. They've never had a \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Doubtless, she's right about this, but her argument, alas, ignores the fact that just as many Labour women MPs as Conservative are off: the latest casualty is Sian James, the MP for Swansea East. (Our meeting, I should add, takes place before the Daily Mail's story about \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2 's time at the \uc2 National Council for Civil Liberties\uc2 , and that organisation's links to the Paedophile Information Exchange. When I call Cooper's office for a response to it, I'm referred to her \uc2 Twitter\uc2  feed: "Known @Harriet Harman for 25 yrs and rarely met a stronger champion of families & children or defender of women & child victims of violence.")\par \par \uc2 HEr Home Office brief is undoubtedly challenging - in opposition, a lot of her work is "reactive" - but she's proud of her campaigns for new legislation on stalking, and for Britain to accept Syrian refugees (the government accepted the arguments in both cases). Is she aware, though, of how right wing she sounds when it comes to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ? "I don't think our approach is right wing. If we say nothing, which is what we did before the 2010 election, we leave the whole debate free for the right wing. Tone does matter; that's why we were so critical of the vans [which told illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to go home]. But we have to recognise that people are worried."\par \par \uc2 It's said - though this might be a sexist cliche - that women are more collaborative than men. What does she make of Theresa May? Do they ever have a drink? Cooper cools visibly. "She's a strong House of Commons performer. But her focus is too narrow. It's an impoverished agenda. It's not a case of women and men, it's to do with different styles. Theresa doesn't provide briefings the way previous home secretaries like \uc2 Alan Johnson\uc2  and Jacqui Smith did."\par \par \uc2 Cooper has brought up her children herself - she and Balls have three - so I feel fine about asking how she makes it all work, the office and home. I wonder what she said to Ed when they met all those years ago (they were working for \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2  at the time). Did she tell him: I'm always going to work; I won't ever iron your underpants? Or is he just an amazing feminist man? "I wish I could say it was planned," she says. "I think it was just obvious to both of us that we would share looking after the children and the home. He does the cooking and the shopping, and I do more washing." Does she ever feel anxious about this? "No! No, I really don't. You should try my cooking. I feel guilty about the children, everybody does, but not about the house."\par \par \uc2 How does it feel when the papers are having a go at Balls? "People in the street think what they read in the paper is rubbish. There was a period when our children's school went into special measures, and a couple of newspapers sent photographers to the school. That is hard. They didn't choose it." Do they tell each other how they did on, say, Newsnight? "Sometimes, you do talk. A lot of the time, you don't."\par \par \uc2 From the outside, Cooper's career looks long-planned and seamless: after Oxford, where she took a first in PPE, she was a special adviser for a series of politicians; she was elected MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford before she was 30. "I did try journalism," she says, reminding me of her brief stint at the Independent. "It was too frustrating: I wrote this great article on that nine months ago, but so what?" Crikey. But if she's aware how this might sound to me, she gives no sign.\par \par \uc2 Her interest in politics was, she says, not party political at first. It was the anti-apartheid movement that attracted her as a teenager. Oxford was a "massive opportunity", but felt "very public school, very posh". Was she surprised to get a first? Did she work all the time? "I did a lot of theatre, actually." Good training for politics? "Exactly."\par \par \uc2 However, it's the year she spent at home with ME when she was in her early 20s that seems to live largest in her memory; she brings it up unprompted. "The things I'd taken for granted, like being able to cross a road quickly, disappeared. This Morning was my lifeline. In Brookside, the body was under the patio. I was completely up to date with all the soaps."\par \par \uc2 She knows it's coming, my question about the leadership; I can tell. The room grows suddenly airless; her aide, who is recording our conversation, starts to fidget, wanting me to wind up. In 2010, when \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  stood down as Labour leader, Cooper wrote a detailed explanation of why she did not want to join the race to be his successor. Her children were, she said, too young. However, this statement came with a tease. "As for future leadership contests," she wrote. "Who knows. . ."\par \par \uc2 It seems clear that Balls, who did stand in 2010 (he came third), is unlikely ever to be Labour leader; there are some who believe he shouldn't even be chancellor should Labour win. Meanwhile, he now spends a lot of his time talking about his love of cooking and playing the piano. Do they have an agreement? Will she stand next time there is an opening? "I want to be Labour home secretary," she says, just as I knew she would.\par \par \uc2 Wouldn't it be great, though, if Labour were to have a woman in charge? It seems overdue. "Well, we've had Margaret [Beckett] and Harriet [Harman] as acting leaders. Feminism is important to me but there's a huge amount I can do as home secretary."\par \par \uc2 What was that I said about women MPs and ambition? Her own is swaddled like a baby in earnest words and practised modesty. But I can feel it all the same. Why else would such a clever and determined woman be so careful, so quiet, so heroically uncontroversial?\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Yvette Cooper photographed\par \par \uc2 in London last month for the Observer New Review.\par \par \uc2 Cooper in Eastbourne with her husband, Ed Balls, after their wedding in January 1998.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Feature | 30 UNDER 30 Holly Williams reports on the inaugural Magnum 30 Under 30 competition, and the rise of a new generation of narrative-documentary photographers\par \par \uc2 DAVID HURN likens the esteemed Magnum photographic agency to "a family". He's been part of it since 1965, when he would get feedback from the likes of Bruce Davidson, Henri Cartier-Bresson and Elliott Erwitt. "When you come into this co-operative, you suddenly have access to people who are all better than you," he says. "That's the way to learn." And now Hurn, who was 30 when he joined the agency, is more than happy to be sharing his expertise with a new generation.\par \par \uc2 As well as setting up an influential photo-journalism course in Newport in the 1970s, he today tours colleges to give talks to students. So Hurn was an obvious candidate to help judge the inaugural 30 Under 30 competition, run by Magnum and The Photography Show alongside arts charity IdeasTap, to encourage and promote the world's best emerging talents.\par \par \uc2 The competition invited those aged 18 to 30 to submit five documentary photographs from a narrative project. The judges were looking for "a clear storyline, technique, execution, concept and originality" in the work - and the 30 winning entries are currently on show at the Photography Show in Birmingham.\par \par \uc2 The final 30 form a notably international bunch; the five featured here hail from Iran to Venezuela, the UK to Ukraine. "Some of the photographs that I think are the best come from countries where it's rather brave that they're even photographing at all," says Hurn.\par \par \uc2 Not that he prioritised political or social issues while judging. "What I look for is authorship," he says - "somebody [whose] pictures don't look like anybody else's pictures. Most people take lots of pictures, which you see on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  - thousands and thousands of pictures - but they could have been taken by anybody.\par \par \uc2 "Also, I love pictures of people who cry, or laugh, or show some kind of emotion - I'm not in the least interested in walls or peeling paint, which seems to be what people are taught to do nowadays." But the Magnum cache impressed on this front: "There were lots of people in this group who seemed to be interested in the fact that human beings relate to each other, and that that is an interesting thing to look at and glorify."\par \par \uc2 Although now a veteran, Hurn wants the industry to pay more attention to emerging photographers. When he was still in his twenties, he was photographing everything from the Hungarian Revolution to The Beatles and James Bond. Such early success is now rare - though why, in an era when we so fetishise youthful talent, is a mystery. "It's about time that we went back to the days when we didn't think that young photographers had to be 36," he says. "Everything has got older now, which puzzles me - especially when one thinks that the first Magnum photographers were all in the agency by the time they were 24 or 25."\par \par \uc2 30 Under 30 is run by The Photography Show and Magnum Photos. Pictures from all 30 photographers are being displayed at The Photography Show until Tuesday at Birmingham NEC (photographyshow.com)\par \par \uc2 Maxim Dondyuk 29\par \par \uc2 Ukraine\par \par \uc2 "The collapse of the Soviet Union also brought the disintegration of a centralised system of tuberculosis control, which for a long time had been a source of pride. The public health systems of some economically unstable countries from the former Soviet Union suffer from poor funding, a lack of training and cumbersome bureaucracy.\par \par \uc2 "Ukraine has the highest burden of TB in Europe. I was greatly influenced by what I saw during my shooting [on a TB ward]. Every hour, four cases of TB are recorded. Every day, about 30 people die from the disease."\par \par \uc2 Lynn Rothwell 23\par \par \uc2 Britain\par \par \uc2 "This project explores the idea of the ordinary becoming extraordinary through photography. In questioning our visual expectations of the everyday, it highlights the cinematic qualities within our normal surroundings.\par \par \uc2 "Most of the images were taken around the area where I grew up, in Dublin. I'm interested in the way that what one person considers everyday or mundane can be visually exciting for others. It also forced me to look differently at my everyday surroundings and see new things. All of the images were taken using family and friends as models."\par \par \uc2 Alejandro Cegarra 22\par \par \uc2 Venezuela\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Tower of David is a skyscraper located in downtown Caracas, Venezuela. Construction began in 1990, but in 1994, the building was halted due to the country\u8217\'20\'19s banking crisis.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThirteen years later, in 2007, approximately 2,000 families invaded the space illegally.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor the inhabitants, the Tower is their part in the Bolivarian Revolution. Their way of life represents a fight against the social parameters in which they are viewed as a dysfunctional community.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe take-over of the Tower, and their way of life remain controversial; but the reality is that the inhabitants are simply people who are searching for a sense of belonging, and a place to call home.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ayman Oghanna 26\par \par \uc2 British Iraqi\par \par \uc2 "My father left Iraq in the 1970s, before Saddam's wars, sanctions and before invasion and civil war, when Iraq nearly car-bombed, kidnapped and executed itself into oblivion. In 2009, I flew to Baghdad to photograph the city. Before you visit anywhere, there is a visual preconception of it in your mind.\par \par \uc2 "My preconception had been framed through the lens of the US military and war - barbed wire, American soldiers and carnage.\par \par \uc2 "When I arrived, I was shocked. Iraq looked unfamiliar. There was violence, sure, but also people trying to rebuild ordinary lives devoid of conflict and suffering."\par \par \uc2 Javad Parsa 27\par \par \uc2 Iran\par \par \uc2 "My project is about Iranian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and refugees in Oslo, Norway. Tens of thousands of people leave Iran every year, impelled by a lack of political, religious, economic and social freedom to go in search of a better life. The majority of people fleeing the country go to the UK, Turkey or Germany.\par \par \uc2 "I never imagined myself as one of these thousands of Iranians who would have left their homeland, but I had to flee Iran in 2009. The government had issued an arrest warrant for me, after my images of the Iranian uprising of that year had been published abroad. I fled to Turkey, and after 16 months of hope and expectation, Norway finally accepted me as a refugee.\par \par \uc2 "In my new life I have met up with many fellow Iranian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and refugees. They all have different reasons for having left their mother country. But every one I spoke to hoped that one day they could return to Iran - but to an Iran where they were allowed to vote in truly democratic elections, speak freely, dress the way they wanted to, and choose their own religion and beliefs." *\par \par \uc2 Document INDOS00020140302ea320002i\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Ed Balls' think tank wants \uc2 immigrants\uc2  to have full British citizenship\b0\par\par\uc2 By Marco Giannangeli   \par \uc2 355 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 March 2014\par 00:09\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 ED BALLS faced mounting criticism last night after a call by his favourite think tank to give illegal \u173\'00\'AD\b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  full rights as citizens.\par \par \uc2 A new report, The Economic Case For A Clear, Quick Pathway To Citizenship, suggests there would be \u8220\'20\'1Csignificant" economic benefits in \u8220\'20\'1Copening a door for undocumented \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to earn legal status and, ultimately, citizenship".\par \par \uc2 It was produced by the Centre for American Progress, which pays for the shadow chancellor to fly to Washington four times a year to chair meetings.\par \par \uc2 The report refers primarily to the US but suggests European countries should take the same course.\par \par \uc2 Last night Conservative MP Priti Patel said: \u8220\'20\'1CFor more than a decade Labour let \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  get out of control. Now Ed Balls\u8217\'20\'19s own think tank wants an amnesty for illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . This would put more pressure on public services from people who haven\u8217\'20\'19t contributed with their hard work and taxes.\par \par \uc2 "The Conservatives want to reduce \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  so families get good quality healthcare and our children are taken care of. But Labour have opposed every step we have taken."\par \par \uc2 Last year Lord Mandelson, who served as a Cabinet minister under Tony Blair, admitted the New Labour government \u8220\'20\'1Csent out search parties" for migrants.\par \par \uc2 The think tank report comes as figures reveal a surge in \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to the UK, with the number of migrants increasing by more than a third to 212,000 in the 12 months to September 2013.\par \par \uc2 The figures, said to have been boosted by Romanian and Bulgarian economic migration, are a bitter blow to Prime Minister David Cameron who has just one year to keep his pledge to cut \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to under 100,000.\par \par \uc2 At Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s spring conference last week, Nigel Farage said mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  had made parts of the UK unrecognisable: \u8220\'20\'1CWhether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact that in many parts of England you don\u8217\'20\'19t hear English spoken any more, this is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140302ea32000dy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 Four artists, writers and composers whose work defined the war\b0\par\par\uc2 Patrick Bishop   \par \uc2 2,134 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 March 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 6,7,8,9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The First World War was the first conflict to spawn a wealth of artistic output from those who fought on its battlefields. The Somme alone saw more writers take part than any other battle in history, including Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, JRR Tolkien and Edmund Blunden. There, and on other fighting fronts, a new breed of well-educated soldier vividly chronicled their first-hand experiences through words, art and music.\par \par \uc2 Some were killed in action, bright lights of their generation such as the composer George Butterworth - another Somme casualty - whose creative promise would never be fulfilled. The "luckier" ones were left forever with a survivor's guilt that darkly permeated their future work. All leave an invaluable legacy, whether through poetry, memoirs, fiction or art, that helps future generations to understand the reality of war.\par \par \uc2 Here, Patrick Bishop selects four artists, composers and writers (and their key works) who experienced the conflict first-hand and whose works have not only come to define the war; they changed what came after.\par \par \uc2 OTTO DIX: TRENCH WARFARE (1932)\par \par \uc2 Dix was a 23-year-old art student in Dresden when the war broke out and he enlisted enthusiastically in the German Army. He fought as a machine-gunner on the Eastern and Western fronts, took part in the Battle of the Somme, won the Iron Cross and left the trenches only after being shot in the neck a few months before hostilities ended. His experiences were to haunt him for the rest of his life and inform some of his darkest and most brilliant work. The results are exemplified by his 1932 painting Trench Warfare (below), whose macabre imagery and charnel-house palette evoke a medieval atmosphere of suffering and evil. Dix was determined to confront the public with the reality of the war, but his honesty was unwelcome and the picture caused an outcry when first shown in Cologne. The "unpatriotic" message of pointlessness was not lost on the Nazis, who included it in their 1937 exhibition of degenerate art.\par \par \uc2 PAUL NASH: WE ARE MAYING A NEW WORLD (1918)\par \par \uc2 No human figure inhabits this 1918 landscape (left). Nash seems to be saying that they are all gone, subsumed in the churned, polluted earth, stagnant water and shattered tree stumps, which the rising sun will never restore to life.\par \par \uc2 Nash was a public schoolboy, the son of a successful London lawyer. In 1914 he was at the Slade School of Art, one of a brilliant batch of students that included Stanley Spencer, Ben Nicholson and CRW Nevinson. He volunteered first for the Artists Rifles and arrived as a subaltern on the Western Front in February 1917. He was sent home after injuring himself in an accident but returned that autumn as an official war artist. His work did little to popularise the cause. As he declared in a letter to his wife, he was "no longer an artist, interested and curious", there to observe and record, but a "messenger" bent on bearing witness to the horrors of trench life. He succeeded triumphantly. Over the years, the flat colours and bold shapes of his wartime paintings have embedded themselves in our consciousness. When the next war broke out, Nash served once again as an official artist, creating images that are perhaps less bleak but equally unforgettable.\par \par \uc2 WYNDHAM LEWIS: A BATTERY SHELLED (1919)\par \par \uc2 Wyndham Lewis perhaps knew more than any of his artistic contemporaries about the business of war.\par \par \uc2 He was in his thirties when the conflict began; and had already established himself as a leading light of the avant garde as the founder of the cubism-inspired Vorticist school and the author of its short-lived but hugely influential journal, Blast.\par \par \uc2 As an gunnery officer, he was intimately engaged in the artillery duels that did most of the killing on the Western Front. As well as commanding a battery, he acted as spotter, operating from exposed forward observation posts to call down fire on the enemy.\par \par \uc2 A Battery Shelled (above) is a mysterious construct. A group of soldiers, one of them apparently Lewis, look out with seeming indifference over a sterile landscape of bunkers and geometric trench lines peopled by robotic stick men.\par \par \uc2 Vorticism did not survive the war and subsequently Lewis applied his questing energy to writing and criticism, much of it contentious.\par \par \uc2 COMPOSERS\par \par \uc2 GEORGE BUTTERWORTH\par \par \uc2 The Banks of Green Willow (1913) Shot through the head by a sniper on the Somme in August 1916, Butterworth is a symbol of the budding talent that was burned up in the holocaust of the war.\par \par \uc2 Born into the Victorian upper-middle classes, he went to Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, and was a friend of Ralph Vaughan Williams. He made his name with settings of AE Housman's A Shropshire Lad and an interpretation of a folk song, The Banks of Green Willow \u8212\'20\'14 often played during commemoration ceremonies on the Somme. This "idyll" summons up a prelapsarian image of the English countryside, evoking birdsong, a stream dimpled by rising trout and the scent of fresh-cut hay.\par \par \uc2 Few of his comrades knew of his musical accomplishments. He was thought of instead as an outstandingly brave soldier. By the time of his death aged 31, he had been mentioned in dispatches and won the Military Cross.\par \par \uc2 MAURICE RAVEL\par \par \uc2 Le tombeau de Couperin (1914-17)\par \par \uc2 Ravel was established as one of France's leading composers when the war began through such works as the score for Daphnis et Chlo\u233\'00\'E9, written for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. He hoped to do his bit for his country as an aviator, but was considered too old (39) and too short (5ft 3ins). Instead, he served as a driver on the Verdun front. The appalling toll that the war took of French manhood hit everyone and Ravel was no exception. He memorialised six of his dead friends in Le tombeau de Couperin, a suite for solo piano in six movements. The final part is dedicated to the husband of his favourite pianist, Marguerite Long.\par \par \uc2 ARNOLD SCHOENBERG\par \par \uc2 Variations for Orchestra (1926-28)\par \par \uc2 Initially, at least, the brilliant Austrian-born composer and musical theorist saw the war as an opportunity to overthrow what he regarded as the bourgeois decadence of established French music. The German military assault would also be a symbolic attack on the "mediocre kitschiness" of the likes of Ravel. The mood did not last long. Drafted into the Austrian Army at 42, Schoenberg resented the disruption to his work, which was already well advanced on its revolutionary journey away from traditional tonality and musical organisation. Variations for Orchestra produced a storm of controversy when premiered by the Berlin Philharmonic under the baton of Wilhelm Furtw\u228\'00\'E4ngler in December 1928. With the arrival of the Nazis in power, Schoenberg's Jewishness and the perceived "decadence" of his music forced him to move to America, where he settled in Los Angeles and taught at American universities. He died there in 1951.\par \par \uc2 GUSTAV HOLST\par \par \uc2 Ode to Death (1918-19)\par \par \uc2 Before the war, the English composer Gustav Holst was a scholar at the \uc2 Royal College of Music\uc2 , a professional musician and teacher. Aged 40 when war broke out, he was rejected as unfit for military service and felt frustrated that friends and family were doing their bit, including his wife, who became an ambulance driver, and his close friend Ralph Vaughan Williams, on active service in France. But in the final months of war, Holst had his chance to serve \u8212\'20\'14 as a volunteer working with British troops in Europe awaiting demobilisation. Having been told his surname, Von Holst, looked too Germanic, he changed it by deed poll to Holst and became the YMCA's musical organiser in Salonika. His most famous work, The Planets, was written in 1914 before the war had made its cataclysmic impact, but it included a portrayal of the reality of warfare in Mars and became a huge international success after the First World War. On his return from Salonica, he wrote his choral work, Ode to Death, a contemplation on the waste and futility of war, inspired by a Walt Whitman poem.\par \par \uc2 WRITERS\par \par \uc2 HENRI BARBUSSE\par \par \uc2 Under Fire (1916)\par \par \uc2 The son of a French father and an English mother, Barbusse had a minor reputation as a poet and novelist when the war began. He joined the French Army, serving until the end of 1915, when he was moved to a clerical job after his health collapsed. His grimly realistic, Prix Goncourt-winning novel Under Fire was based on three months of combat and gave an early view of the reality of life in the trenches. Subtitled "the story of a squad", it describes a world of tangled wire, dank earthworks and random death in which the fighters live surrounded by the stinking corpses of their comrades. After his discharge in 1917, Barbusse became a vigorous anti-war campaigner. He also adopted communism and, after visiting Moscow in 1918, married a Russian, becoming an uncritical admirer of the Soviet Union and Joseph Stalin.\par \par \uc2 ERNST JUNGER\par \par \uc2 Storm of Steel (1920)\par \par \uc2 J\u252\'00\'FCnger first saw action as a 20-year-old with the 73rd Hanoverian Regiment on the Western Front in April 1915. By the end, he had been wounded at least seven times and won the Iron Cross and the Pour le M\u233\'00\'E9rite (Blue Max). J\u252\'00\'FCnger's artistic response to combat was unusual. Soldiering was "a good and strenuous life". Far from a ghastly ordeal, he celebrates a quasi-mystical experience and "an incomparable schooling of the heart". These conclusions reached in Storm of Steel seemed to make him a natural supporter of Hitler and Nazism. Yet he kept his distance from them and, despite his fierce nationalism and antidemocratic convictions, defied easy categorisation. His work is an eloquent and stylish expression of a rarely acknowledged truth \u8212\'20\'14 war was not hell for everyone. For some it was thrilling and fulfilling, the high point of their existence. He died aged 102, garlanded with honours.\par \par \uc2 VERA BRITTAIN\par \par \uc2 Testament of Youth (1933)\par \par \uc2 The consequences of the slaughter of their menfolk on the lives of the women were immense. Vera Brittain, 20 years old and a middle-class bluestocking when the war began, lost her brother, three close male friends and the man she loved, Roland Leighton, who died in France in December 1915. Brittain, who worked as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse in London, Malta and France, described the impact on her life in a cathartic memoir, Testament of Youth. Its message was of grief and loss as she struggled to remake the life she had imagined for herself before disaster struck. It became a classic that resonated down the rest of the 20th century. Despite her fame and success, she never quite escaped from the shadows of the war. When she died in 1970, her ashes were scattered on her brother's grave in Italy.\par \par \uc2 ERICH MARIA REMARQUE\par \par \uc2 All Quiet on the Western Front (1929)\par \par \uc2 Remarque said his aim in All Quiet on the Western Front was "simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped shells, were destroyed by the war". Based on his experiences in Flanders in 1917, it became an international bestseller and was made into an Oscar-winning film. Its extraordinary appeal may stem from Remarque's success in universalising the soldiers' experience \u8212\'20\'14 that the war was the same for all who fought. It also articulated the alienation felt by combatants from the societies they were supposedly defending. The Nazis burned the book and forced Remarque into exile. Unable to lay hands on him, they turned on his sister, Elfriede, who was found guilty of defeatism and put to death in 1943.\par \par \uc2 DAVID BOMBERG: SAPPERS AT WORY (1918-19)\par \par \uc2 Bomberg was the son of working-class Polish-Jewish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  parents and one of the most precocious talents of his generation. He was another product of the prewar Slade but left after disagreements with the surgeon-turned-teacher Henry Tonks, the school's presiding genius who disapproved of his avantgarde approach. Bomberg drew inspiration from cubism, futurism and Vorticism, employing an angular, machine-age aesthetic.\par \par \uc2 He joined the Royal Engineers in 1915 and his first-hand experience of the most mechanised war in history was to have a profound effect on his artistic development. By the time he painted this picture of Canadian tunnellers burrowing under Hill 50 at Saint Eloi, south east of Ypres, he was moving back to the more naturalistic style that he would employ for the rest of his working life.\par \par \uc2 Bomberg lost his brother and his friend, the poet Isaac Rosenberg, to the war. His subsequent preoccupation with the colours and shapes of nature can be seen as a response to his own harrowing experiences.\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140302ea3200034\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 It is tempting to see a link between our climate and pragmatic culture\b0\par\par\uc2 Michael Hanlon   \par \uc2 675 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 March 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 34\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Does tempestuous weather make for tempestuous people? The idea that the differences between various cultures, nations and societies can be, at least in part, explained by differences in landscape, geology and climate has become unfashionable, but that doesn't mean it is wrong.\par \par \uc2 It is striking, for instance, how extreme the weather of the United States is, compared to that of the nations that provided the bulk of its early \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  - places like Britain, Ireland, Italy and Germany. And I have wondered if some of the differences between American and European culture can be, to some extent, explained by this.\par \par \uc2 The weather is a part of American life in a way we cannot really imagine. In some places, in some winters, walk outside without a decent coat and within an hour you would be in serious trouble, or even dead. It is unsurprising that they devote entire TV channels to it.\par \par \uc2 The Deep South welters, the West bakes, there are hurricanes, forest fires, droughts and tornadoes aplenty. You will never use the word "heatwave" again if you have stood, as I have, on the floor of Death Valley when the thermometer is nudging 50 degrees and you have to put clothes on to keep cool. If you live in the Bible Belt - a place where every autumn 300mph whirlwinds appear that are powerful enough to fling not only cows but 100-ton railway locomotives into the skies, and which can raze entire towns - it would perhaps be surprising if your thoughts did not turn to the Almighty on a regular basis.\par \par \uc2 Compare weather records for the United States with that of Britain. Of the 50 states, only two have recorded maximum temperatures lower than the highest ever seen in the UK. Our transatlantic cousins experience more wind, more heat, more cold and a great deal more snow than we ever have to put up with. So how does the weather on our side of the ocean affect our temperament?\par \par \uc2 It is tempting to see a link between our benign climate and Britain's extraordinarily pragmatic culture. Our islands are not a land of extremes, neither in the climatic nor the political sense.\par \par \uc2 The fiercest revolutions have been forged in lands of extreme cold, heat or tempest. A trite observation, perhaps, but it is more difficult to imagine serious political ferment breaking out in a place like Britain or New Zealand than in Spain or Russia.\par \par \uc2 In this country we like to think of ourselves as stoical in the face of meteorological adversity. It is true that, as individuals, we are capable of putting up with a great deal - the recent floods have been accompanied by much fortitude. But collectively we have hysterics whenever the skies turn against us. While the Americans (and Russians) expect dreadful weather, we most certainly do not.\par \par \uc2 The anthropologist Robert Ardrey once described Homo sapiens as the "Bad Weather Animal", defined by and profiting from unpredictable skies. While we in Britain generally lack truly bad weather, when some does come along we certainly allow it to define us.\par \par \uc2 Two US states - Alaska and Hawaii-have a top recorded temperature of 38C, lower than the UK's high\par \par \uc2 Weather changes can affect vehicle tyre pressures. Drivers should check them at least once a month\par \par \uc2 Audi quattro: perfect driving, whatever the weather\par \par \uc2 Driving offers limitless opportunities to explore. Whichever route you take \u8212\'20\'14 from motorway to rural track \u8212\'20\'14 you need a good grip on the road in all conditions. Over 30 years, Audi's quattro technology has evolved, resulting in superior handling you can rely on. A car fitted with quattro reacts to the changing terrain beneath it and delivers power wherever it's needed across all four wheels. Whether you are dealing with a rain-slick motorway, icy Tarmac or loose gravel, quattro ensures a safe, responsive drive every time.\par \par \uc2 38.5C is the top temperature recorded in the UK - on August 10, 2003, in Faversham, Kent\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140302ea320006j\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15
