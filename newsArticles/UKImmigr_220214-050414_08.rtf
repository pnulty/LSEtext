Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Samantha Cameron\uc2 , the wife of the Prime Minister, was involved in the family's foreign-born nanny securing British citizenship while she was working for the Prime Minister.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Cameron allowed her name to be entered on an application form for British citizenship for her long-term nanny Gina Lima four years ago.\par \par \uc2 Miss Lima\u8217\'20\'19s citizenship was granted towards the end of 2010, months after the Camerons entered 10 Downing Street in May that year. Applications typically take six months to process.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s office disclosed late on Thursday that the Camerons\u8217\'20\'19 nanny Gita Lima, who has worked for the family for years, is now a British citizen.\par \par \uc2 After initially declining to give further details, a Number 10 spokesman released a statement. She said: \u8220\'20\'1CMr and Mrs Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s nanny became a British citizen in late 2010.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMr and Mrs Cameron did not write a letter supporting their nanny\u8217\'20\'19s application for British citizenship. The normal application process was followed throughout. As is usual, Mrs Cameron was named on her application as her employer."\par \par \uc2 There is no suggestion that the Camerons broke any rules over the application. But the limited response leaves open the possibility that Mr or Mrs Cameron could have been one of two referees on the application required by the Home Office.\par \par \uc2 The revelation may also be politically awkward for the Prime Minister given his party\u8217\'20\'19s increasingly tough rhetoric on foreign workers and those who employ them.\par \par \uc2 James Brokenshire the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, this week appeared to criticise the \u8220\'20\'1Cwealthy metropolitan elite" who use \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to provide \u8220\'20\'1Ccheap labour".\par \par \uc2 Such people had gained from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  while \u8220\'20\'1Cordinary hardworking people" have suffered, the minister said.\par \par \uc2 The speech was privately criticised by some Tory ministers, and publicly attacked by business leaders who have said \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  curbs are harming the UK economy.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron has not said he would bar all foreign labour, but he has promised to cut net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - currently running at more than 250,000 \u8211\'20\'13 to less than 100000.\par \par \uc2 He has also promised to curb the arrival in Britain of unskilled and poorly educated migrant workers.\par \par \uc2 Despite those pledges, the Camerons have now provided direct employment for at least two foreign domestic staff, including Miss Lima - who is not known to have arrived in the country with any significant educational or vocational qualifications.\par \par \uc2 Australian-born Sammi Strange was hired as a nanny in 2012 for a six week period when Miss Lima took extended break.\par \par \uc2 Miss Lima was first hired by the Camerons in the middle part of the last decade to help care for their disabled son Ivan, who died in 2009. She came from a charity called Kalayaan, which helps \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  seeking to escape abusive employers.\par \par \uc2 Some Tory ministers are privately worried that Mr Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s speech has only succeeded in drawing attention to the household arrangements of senior politicians.\par \par \uc2 One source said: \u8220\'20\'1CIf voters thought we were the metropolitan elite before, this will just confirm it."\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage MEP, the leader of the UK Independence Party, said on Friday night: \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a perfect illustration of an uncomprehending, wealthy Metropolitan elite who now so dominate politics in the UK.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COrdinary decent British people are paying the price through loss of jobs and a significant wage depreciation over the last few years."\par \par \uc2 Phil Wilson, the Labour MP, said: \u8220\'20\'1CThere must now be complete transparency and openness from the Prime Minister over any contact between him, his office and the Home Office regarding his family\u8217\'20\'19s nanny."\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140308ea370018h\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 A nanny from Nepal and a Belgian 'lady': Cameron and Clegg under fire for taking on foreign help to work in their homes\b0\par\par\uc2 JACK DOYLE and JAMES SLACK   \par \uc2 638 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 March 2014\par 00:21\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

It is total hypocrisy. They need to make up their minds on this.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 In his first speech in the job, Mr Brokenshire told the Demos think-tank: \u8216\'20\'18The \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system we inherited was not designed to benefit this country or the people who live here.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18For too long, the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour, or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services, but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Those who tend to lose out most when there is uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  are manual and low-skilled workers who have to compete with an influx of people from poorer countries who are willing to work for less.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Downing Street refused to answer any questions about Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s nanny.\par \par \uc2 But it is understood Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha employ a Nepalese woman, Gita Lima. She was recruited from a charity, Kalayaan, which helps \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  seeking to escape abusive employers.\par \par \uc2 Originally from Nepal, she is now a British national. A second woman, Australian Sammi Strange, has looked after Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s children in the past.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg was asked about his arrangements on his regular LBC radio phone-in. He insisted he would not \u8216\'20\'18get into\u8217\'20\'19 details of his home life but later told listeners: \u8216\'20\'18I have a lady who has a Belgian passport who helps us.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The Home Office said Mr Brokenshire \u8216\'20\'18manages the household with his wife\u8217\'20\'19 and does not employ a nanny or cleaner.\par \par \uc2 In his speech, the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister attacked the BBC for giving huge prominence to a report about the impact of mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on the jobs market \u8211\'20\'13 without having read it.

The government must address the restrictions on visas for highly skilled workers. This would allow businesses to access the people they need to grow and create jobs for more British workers."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 UK Commission for Employment and Skills\uc2  gave warning recently that skills shortages threatened to hold back the pace of recovery in parts of the economy.\par \par \uc2 Faced with shortages, employers complain of delays and uncertainty in knowing whether they will be allowed to hire staff from outside the EU.\par \par \uc2 Mr Green said the "tier 1" route under the government's classification had been limited to investors and entrepreneurs, making it hard for companies to bring in engineers and IT staff. Post-study visas, under which students could stay on to work after gaining their qualification, had been removed, while "tier 2" - the work permit route - was long and costly.\par \par \uc2 He called for the "shortage occupation list", under which work permits can be fast-tracked in areas of skill shortage, to be widened to include more categories in technology and engineering.\par \par \uc2 The REC-KPMG survey also shows that starting salaries for permanent workers grew at their highest rate last month for more than six years - a potential indication that the near six-year squeeze on real wages may end later this year, as the Treasury and \uc2 Office for Budget Responsibility\uc2  have forecast.\par \par \uc2 Permanent staff appointments grew at their fastest pace for almost four years, with northern England seeing the strongest rise and London the weakest. However, hiring of temporary staff increased at the slowest pace for three months.\par \par \uc2 Surveys continue to point to strong hiring intentions, though job growth slowed down in the most recent official data from the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Bernard Brown, a KPMG partner, said that while employers were looking to hire permanent staff, candidates were "less certain, preferring to stay put than advance their careers in a new environment".\par \par \uc2 Individuals' nervousness about job security might be misplaced, he added. "The simple fact is that employers wouldn't be competing to offer candidates ever-increasing salaries if they couldn't afford to sustain them."\par \par \uc2 Organisers of the government-backed National Apprenticeship Week said that more than 20,000 new apprenticeships had been pledged by employers this week, including 5,000 by \uc2 Lloyds Banking Group\uc2 , 2,000 each by Greene King and Whitbread and 1,000 each by EE, Mitchells & Butlers and \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Almost half of the new apprenticeships were pledged by small and medium-sized enterprises.\par \par \uc2 . . .\par \par \uc2 Alexander calls for looser migrant rules\par \par \uc2 Britain will need looser \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rules over the next decade to help plug a yawning employment gap in engineering and other high-skill sectors, according to Danny Alexander, writes George Parker.\par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrat Treasury chief secretaryhas written to Theresa May, home secretary, saying that instead of clamping down on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , Britain needs to be even more welcoming to engineers, scientists and technology workers.\par \par \uc2 He cited a \uc2 Royal Academy of Engineering\uc2  report, which said Britain would need more than 800,000 such workers between 2012 and 2030, but that UK universities were projected to turn out only 32,000 engineering graduates a year.\par \par \uc2 The Home Office's cap on highly skilled migrants - so-called "tier 2" - is 20,700 a year, but James Brokenshire, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, said on Thursday that applications were running at only half that level.\par \par \uc2 Mr Alexander says the operation of the scheme - which sets a minimum salary threshold - deters PhD students from coming to Britain and others entering the sector.\par \par \uc2 He told Mrs May: "We should listen to our business leaders when they tell us that this route does not work for all.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020140307ea370005n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NATIONAL NEWS\par \b \uc2 Tory minister hits 'own goal' on debut in migrant debate\b0\par\par\uc2 By Helen Warrell and Elizabeth Rigby   \par \uc2 753 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 March 2014\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFT\par \uc2 London Ed1\par 03\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 James Brokenshire, the new \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, has caused a storm with his first speech by criticising the "wealthy metropolitan elite" for relying on cheap overseas labour after it emerged that \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  had hired two nannies from outside the EU.\par \par \uc2 "For too long, the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services - but not the ordinary, hard- working people of this country," he said.\par \par \uc2 However, Mr Brokenshire's salvo backfired after it appeared he was attacking the prime minister's childcare arrangements.\par \par \uc2 Downing Street's official spokesman refused to comment yesterday on whether it was appropriate for Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha to employ an Australian nanny. The couple have previously used a Nepalese nanny, recruited from Kalayaan , a charity that helps \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to escape abusive bosses.\par \par \uc2 Number 10 also refused to answer questions on whether other cabinet ministers employed foreign childcare staff, builders or home helps. "I don't think this is relevant to the speech," said a spokesman. When asked whether the prime minister's office had cleared the speech, the spokesman added: "There are not any concerns about clearance of it."\par \par \uc2 One senior Tory was privately exasperated by the speech, describing it as "an own goal" that "makes a mockery of our own people".\par \par \uc2 "The characteristic that most defines Cameron in the minds of Ukip people is that he is the personification of the metropolitan elite: that is precisely why they don't like him," the Tory said. "So this seems very hollow to voters. When Tories pretend they are not like that, when they are, it's very self-defeating."\par \par \uc2 Efforts to reassure the public that action would be taken on rising UK \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  levels were not welcomed by business. \uc2 Simon Walker\uc2 , director-general of the Institute of Directors, derided Mr Brokenshire's speech as "feeble and pathetic", criticising his "divisive language".\par \par \uc2 "The UK is an open, trading country that benefits from the skills and ideas of migrants," Mr Walker said. "We will not become more prosperous by closing our borders to talented individuals and entrepreneurs from across the world. This speech seems to be more about political positioning and less about what is good for the country."\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire has come under pressure to find ways of cutting net migration following an unexpected surge in the figure last week to 212,000. That is now more than double the "tens of thousands" annual target that the Tories had promised to reach before the next election.\par \par \uc2 In an effort to win over supporters from Ukip, the new Tory minister's comments echoed those of Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who said last year that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was a "class issue".\par \par \uc2 "If you're comfortably off then mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is good because it's cheap nannies, cheap chauffeurs, cheap gardeners," Mr Farage said in November. "If you are a member of the working classes . . . and particularly from the settled ethnic minorities, your chance of getting a job has been diminished."\par \par \uc2 The Tories announced measures aimed at reducing the net migration figure, including reducing the number of visa refusals allowed to UK universities, schools and colleges before their sponsor licences are suspended.\par \par \uc2 Education institutions are punished with suspension if more than 20 per cent of the foreign students they offer places to are turned down by the Home Office. But Mr Brokenshire is expected to bring that figure down to 10 per cent.\par \par \uc2 The Home Office said under current refusal rates, this would affect about 6 per cent of the UK's 1,700 educational visa sponsors.\par \par \uc2 The Tories' efforts to bring down net migration have also sparked rows within the coalition, with Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat business secretary, describing the new, higher rates of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as a "good thing".\par \par \uc2 But Mr Brokenshire accused Mr Cable of spreading "falsehoods" and misunderstanding the effects of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . "The winners [from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ] are the 'haves', like Vince, but the people who lose out are from working-class families, the ethnic minorities and recent \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  themselves," the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister said. "Try telling them that rising \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is good news."\par \par \uc2 Mark Field, MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, said: "At a time when the economic recovery is still fragile, the message should be we are open for business and that is what our \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy should be about."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020140307ea3700009\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Boohoo raises a smile for Manchester's Kamani family\b0\par\par\uc2 By Andrew Bounds   \par \uc2 805 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 March 2014\par 16:37\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

The "Cottonopolis" of the 19th century has remained a centre for the rag trade, but the industry has followed the eastward migration of spinning to cheaper countries in Asia.\par \par \uc2 The old mills of the Northern Quarter, reminiscent of London's Shoreditch, have become giant warehouses where clothes are designed, sourced, shipped in from abroad and then despatched to British high street stores.\par \par \uc2 Mahmud Kamani, co-founder of Boohoo.com, which lists next week with a \u163\'00\'A3560m valuation, grew up on these streets. His father, Abdullah, arrived in the UK in 1968 from Kenya with a wife, four children and a few hundred pounds.\par \par \uc2 Asked why he chose Manchester, Mahmud jokes: "That's where the plane landed. London was probably an extra \u163\'00\'A360."\par \par \uc2 Abdullah began investing in property as mills and factories closed and used family ties with Asia and Africa to import clothing.\par \par \uc2 He set up brands Pinstripe Clothing, Starsign and Jogo in the Dale Street warehouse that now houses Boohoo.\par \par \uc2 It was there that Mahmud met Carol Kane, with whom he founded Boohoo in 2006. He had the money while Ms Kane knew the industry and the tastes of fashionable young women. Together they had supplied the likes of Topshop and Primark through Pinstripe. Now they saw the internet as a way to cut out the retailer, going direct to customers.\par \par \uc2 Those who know Mahmud say he is a natural salesman with "bags of energy" and a penchant for expensive cars. "We are from a community that works hard," he told the FT. His sons Adam and Umar have caught the family bug, and have their own brasher online clothes retailer called PrettyLittleThing, although they are still only teenagers.\par \par \uc2 Umar celebrated his 18th birthday in January by turning a former Methodist chapel in central Manchester into a dance hall, with soap stars and footballers in attendance.\par \par \uc2 However, Boohoo eschews branding. "Brands go in and out of fashion," says Ms Kane. "We want to deliver the latest trend, whether it is maxi dresses or latex. We can move fast."\par \par \uc2 Part of the fast movement comes from Boohoo's sourcing. It has brought related companies in-house so it can design, commission and market a product from "catwalk to closet" in six weeks.\par \par \uc2 The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.\par \par \uc2 <>Its young workforce keep it in touch with trends. "We employ our customers," says Ms Kane.\par \par \uc2 In-house sourcing means margins are more than 60 per cent, better than rival Asos at 50 per cent, and its average price was \u163\'00\'A317.18, compared to \u163\'00\'A324.69 at Asos. Revenues have grown at 67 per cent annually for two years.\par \par \uc2 The company will have a market capitalisation of \u163\'00\'A3560m when it lists on March 14.\par \par \uc2 In the 10 months to December 2013 sales increased by 70 per cent to \u163\'00\'A391.9m, while adjusted earnings before interest, tax and depreciation were \u163\'00\'A310.1m.\par \par \uc2 One local adviser said Boohoo might not be the last online retailer to emerge from the northwest.\par \par \uc2 "There are a whole load of these businesses set up to import from the Indian subcontinent. Boohoo was an early starter, could see that Asos was trading at a ludicrously high multiple and saw the chance," he said.\par \par \uc2 "There is a lot of money looking for a home [on the stock market]," he said.\par \par \uc2 B&M Bargains\uc2 , valued at more than \u163\'00\'A31bn, is tipped to float soon. It was founded by the Arora Brothers, Indian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from a trading family who moved to China to source products for supermarkets before buying their own retailer to sell through.\par \par \uc2 Some investors are drawing parallels between Boohoo and \uc2 AO World\uc2 , an online appliance retailer, which raised \u163\'00\'A360m selling 30 per cent in February. As with AO, the prospectus was published just a week before the float. About 100 institutional investors missed out on buying altogether, as 85 per cent of the new issue was awarded to just 15 investors.\par \par \uc2 AO's shares have risen by a quarter and it is now worth four times its forward sales.\par \par \uc2 However, Boohoo's holding is wider, with nearly 100 investors led by \uc2 Odey Asset Management\uc2  and \uc2 Old Mutual\uc2 , with 7 per cent each. The 50p share price values it at less than half of Asos, according to the FT's Lex column.\par \par \uc2 Some \u163\'00\'A3240m will go to the board and family shareholders (including Abdullah and Mahmud's brother Jalal), while \u163\'00\'A350m will buy its Burnley distribution centre and fund new IT systems.\par \par \uc2 Mahmud, who retains almost 25 per cent, says the money will not distract him. His priority is "Boohoo, Boohoo, Boohoo," he says.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020140307ea37002uv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Tories take tougher stance on \uc2 immigration\uc2  to shore up votes\b0\par\par\uc2 By George Parker, Political Editor   \par \uc2 753 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 March 2014\par 16:39\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 It could have been an episode of the Westminster TV satire The Thick of It.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  was at an EU summit in Brussels on Ukraine, his \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister was at home creating political havoc with a speech accusing a "wealthy metropolitan elite" of fuelling migration with their demand for "cheap" labour.\par \par \uc2 By the time Mr Cameron arrived back in Downing St, James Brokenshire's speech was being mocked by Labour, described as "feeble and pathetic" by the Institute of Directors and nominated by Daily Telegraph blogger Dan Hodges as "the most stupid, intellectually bankrupt and vacuous address of the year".\par \par \uc2 Worse still for Mr Brokenshire, his boss suddenly found himself forced to answer questions about why the Camerons had hired nannies from Australia and Nepal: was it because they were "cheap"? Downing St said the nannies were chosen for the excellent childcare they offered.\par \par \uc2 But what was behind a speech that seemed to offend almost everyone, including natural Tory supporters in the business and media world? Was it evidence of a Tory party which has lost its political bearings?\par \par \uc2 Downing St insists Mr Brokenshire's speech was simply a statement of fact: that the benefits of migration - especially in the downturn - accrued mainly to the middle classes who employed Polish builders and not "ordinary, hardworking people".\par \par \uc2 However, the Tories' tougher tone on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is seen by pollsters as an attempt to counter the danger posed by Nigel Farage's UK Independence party ahead of May's European and local elections, not least because net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is rising.\par \par \uc2 As a Populus/FT poll found this month, Ukip supporters are drawn disproportionately from a group of swing voters that will be pivotal in those elections: manual workers, unskilled workers and the unemployed.\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire's attempt to identify with working people against a "metropolitan elite" - presumably encompassing most of the cabinet - comes just days after Grant Shapps, Tory party chairman, tried to badge the Conservatives as "the workers' party".\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's promise this month to cut taxes if he wins the next election - funded by more public spending cuts - and his promise of an EU referendum are aimed at a similar audience.\par \par \uc2 Anthony Wells, associate director of the pollsters YouGov, says Mr Cameron is following a familiar path trodden by former Tory leaders, including William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith, in heading to the right when things get tough.\par \par \uc2 "Conservative leaders know what their problem is. Every new leader comes in and recognises the party needs to modernise and needs to move to the centre, but that takes 10, 15 or 20 years to get right," he said.\par \par \uc2 "When it doesn't immediately work out, they start talking about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and tax cuts. The thing about \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  is that it has taken him a bit longer to get to that point."\par \par \uc2 The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.\par \par \uc2 <>Mr Cameron's political prospectus now is almost unrecognisable from the one he ran on in 2010, before the full gravity of the economic crisis became apparent. His "vote blue, go green" slogan and Big Society rhetoric were binned long ago.\par \par \uc2 The prime minister who promised to "share the proceeds of growth" between tax cuts and higher public spending is now wedded only to tax cuts; the man who told his party to "stop banging on about Europe" has conceded an EU referendum.\par \par \uc2 Theresa May, home secretary, recognised the party's long-term problem in 2002 when as party chairman she admitted the Tories were seen by some as "the nasty party" and warned against "demonising" minorities.\par \par \uc2 Mr Wells believes that the recent focus on core Tory messages on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , tax cuts and Europe could work in the short term, shoring up the party's support in May's elections and getting the vote out.\par \par \uc2 After all, those who found Mr Brokenshire's tone most grating this week are hardly at the top of Mr Cameron's list of priorities. Captains of industry and members of the "metropolitan elite" are unlikely to stomp off in protest into the arms of Labour.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Wells argues that by singing the old Tory tunes Mr Cameron is making a fundamental mistake: "It's the ongoing tragedy of the Conservative party over the last 20 years: it's the triumph of short-term tactics over long-term strategy."\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020140307ea37002ux\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

She says that for every 100 non-European \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  that come to Britain there are 23 fewer British-born people in work.\par \par \uc2 Ms May is referring to the January 2012 report from \uc2 the Migration Advisory Committee\uc2 , an independent analytical body. It also said that "it would not be appropriate to assume the same impact in a time of strong economic growth".\par \par \uc2 You sound like Mr Cable. Apparently he is 'intensely relaxed' about migration.\par \par \uc2 The business secretary has an "intensely relaxed" attitude towards much of his brief. But the senior Liberal Democrat has many reasons to be chilled out.\par \par \uc2 Such as . . . ?\par \par \uc2 The same MAC report says that "most studies estimat[e] little or no association between migrant inflows and changes to employment or unemployment".\par \par \uc2 But what about this new study, the one that was suppressed?\par \par \uc2 A Downing Street spokesperson said it wasn't ready. So, it wasn't suppressed - it was just "delayed".\par \par \uc2 When did he say that?\par \par \uc2 Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 When did the government publish the report?\par \par \uc2 Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Blimey! To think that employers complain about the British work ethic.\par \par \uc2 It is a joint report between the business department and the Home Office.\par \par \uc2 That couldn't have been easy. What did they agree?\par \par \uc2 To disagree.\par \par \uc2 I thought the report is supposed to be a single view.\par \par \uc2 Yes: it reveals many single views. After all, it is a literature review. But the majority of studies suggest that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  before the financial crisis did not reduce employment for native workers and had a negligible affect on wages.\par \par \uc2 But Ms May says that this is no longer the case.\par \par \uc2 The new report reviews the MAC study and it runs new tests on the data.\par \par \uc2 Wow. It must have found something controversial for Downing Street to have resisted publication.\par \par \uc2 Be careful when using a synecdoche.\par \par \uc2 Sorry, but it sounded as if they had all hands on deck.\par \par \uc2 Never mind. The new report's authors write that the MAC findings were accurate. Over the period 1995 to 2010, there is an association - but no proven link - between non-EU migration and a decline in employment among UK-born workers.\par \par \uc2 So why are people saying the effect is smaller than previously claimed?\par \par \uc2 I think they mean claimed by Ms May rather than the MAC. But when you remove data from the years 2009 and 2010 from the analysis, the non-EU migrant effect disappears.\par \par \uc2 I don't understand why anyone would care about a study that told us more of what we already know.\par \par \uc2 Remember the context. Last week official statistics showed that net migration was 212,000 in the year to September.\par \par \uc2 What should it be?\par \par \uc2 I don't know but Ms May has promised to reduce net migration to the UK to the "tens of thousands".\par \par \uc2 I can see that you would not want to draw any more attention to that miss. Is it a government target?\par \par \uc2 No, the Lib Dems think that it is a silly idea, hence the intense relaxation.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems are silly. I like the idea of a target.\par \par \uc2 Do you think it will be met?\par \par \uc2 No.\par \par \uc2 You are like 80 per cent of Britons: the share of the population who say they support the target yet have no confidence in it.\par \par \uc2 I blame the government. Or am I being synecdochic?\par \par \uc2 john.mcdermott@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @johnpmcdermott\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020140307ea37003ee\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Lockhart, London\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nicholas Lander   \par \uc2 784 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 March 2014\par 18:19\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 My one and only trip to the southern states of America left very strong and very happy memories. There were breakfasts in Savannah, sunny lunches in genteel Charleston and long "cocktail hours" in New Orleans under the tutelage of the late RW Apple Jnr of The New York Times. There was also my introduction to proper corn bread and to muffuletta, the thick, spicy sandwich of boiled meats and cheese, a dish brought to New Orleans by Italian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  in the early 20th century.\par \par \uc2 When I heard that a chef was cooking southern food in central London, my antennae pricked up, though the name, The Lockhart, and the setting, just north of Marble Arch, were hard to picture in a southern context.\par \par \uc2 My first meal began disappointingly. The lunch menu offered only four main courses and two of these, the fried chicken and the muffuletta, had sold out. But the apology was conveyed with such heartfelt concern that it almost made amends, as did the immediate offer of a dish of venison saddle with apples and red eye gravy from the dinner menu. The Lockhart may be a long way physically from the Deep South but there's certainly some southern warmth on offer.\par \par \uc2 On a return trip, I found its muffuletta undeniably authentic. This really is a hefty dish, served both generously and genuinely with the slices of meat and cheese in the middle of a sesame seed bun and a bowl of excellent salt and vinegar crisps on the side.\par \par \uc2 We returned a third time, for dinner, when we were led through to one of the three homespun tables facing the open kitchen. Over a glass of 2012 Pedroncelli Chenin Blanc from California's Dry Creek Valley, I watched the chefs in action: almost all of them, like the waiting staff, were sporting beards.\par \par \uc2 The most magnificent beard belongs to Brad McDonald, who took over as head chef in January. As we ate, and shared a bottle of 2011 Fox Run Cabernet Franc from New York's Finger Lakes, McDonald scooted around the kitchen, shouting out orders, ladling the grits, finishing the dishes and calling for his waiting staff.\par \par \uc2 This view, and what we ate, piqued my interest even further. "Dirty rice" - rice mixed with chicken offal - and crab was given extra piquancy by three smoked West Mersea oysters; a dish of tender white Tokyo turnips came with wafers of country ham; a Madeira-glazed roast quail sat on top of diced cabbage; and the bubbling side order of corn bread in an iron loaf tin looked and tasted most appealing with its glaze of honey butter. With wine and a shared dessert of a lemon icebox pie - lemon ice cream topped with soft meringue and crumbled Graham crackers - the bill came to \u163\'00\'A3120 for two.\par \par \uc2 I returned a fourth time, just after lunch, and sat down for a chat with McDonald. What ensued was the story of his journey from Yazoo City, Mississippi, initially to New York, then to London and, via an introduction over \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , The Lockhart. I also got an explanation of why, every Sunday, 120 doughnuts filled with chocolate and vanilla cream or salted caramel are sold at \u163\'00\'A32 each outside his flat in east London.\par \par \uc2 McDonald grew up eating doughnuts for breakfast, hunting rabbit, duck and turkeys with his father, determined to be a chef. To please his parents he went to college where, he sighed with relief, he met his wife Molly who imbues the restaurant with southern charm. He cooked under \uc2 Thomas Keller\uc2  and \uc2 Alain Ducasse\uc2  in New York, in whose kitchens he learnt technique but not to question anything, and then under Ren\u233\'00\'E9 Redzepi at Noma in Copenhagen, where, as he put it succinctly, "I learnt to question everything."\par \par \uc2 Stints at three restaurants in Brooklyn led to an invitation to come to London last year to consult on the opening of a Mexican restaurant, a move that led to a bout of homesickness. McDonald tweeted that he was planning a dinner of his favourite Southern dishes. This was read by a former manager of The Lockhart - opened in June 2013 by two Texan couples (Lockhart is in fact a small town in their home state). In January they hired the \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  and helped initiate a ritual which every Sunday lunchtime sees them and their two young children selling doughnuts. A family affair - in true Southern fashion.\par \par \uc2 nicholas.lander@ft.com\par \par \uc2 More columns at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ft.com/lander"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 www.ft.com/lander}}}\par \par \uc2 To comment on this article please post below, or email magazineletters@ft.com\par \par \uc2 -------------------------------------------\par \par \uc2 The Lockhart\par \par \uc2 22-24 Seymour Place, London W1 H 7NL, 0203 011 5400, lockhartlondon.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020140307ea37003nl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Farage feels the strain of English on a train\b0\par\par\uc2 By Robert Shrimsley   \par \uc2 761 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 March 2014\par 18:46\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 It was one of those moments in British politics that we metropolitan liberals particularly enjoy. Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence party, let his veil slip a little as he denounced the foreigners changing the very nature of the country in the spittle-flecked prose of radio phone-in. There are some serious issues around \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  but Nigel prides himself on his common touch and so recounted a train journey from hell, surrounded by hordes of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This truly was an ordeal to rival Scott's final push to the Pole. London Bridge, New Cross and Hither Green sped by in a blur of Spanish or Urdu - or Welsh, perhaps. Not till Nigel reached the sunlit uplands of Grove Park were the delicate Farage lugholes able to discern "English being audibly spoken" in the carriage. This will doubtless have been the Lewisham Beowulf Society, whose members travel the commuter lines reading excerpts from the heroic poem.\par \par \uc2 I know how Nigel feels though. Nothing stirs the heart like the sound of the mother tongue on a rush-hour train. Many of us yearn for the days when Chaucer was routinely heard on the main routes out of London. This, I'm sure, was Nigel's real point. You just don't hear Chaucer quoted on the train any more - although I did hear some last week. At least I thought it was; actually, it turned out to be a couple of Norwegian exchange students trying to work out the best route to Sevenoaks.\par \par \uc2 Regulars on that route expressed surprise at Nigel's experience. But perhaps he was excluding modern English or any variant not punctuated with phrases from Ukip dialect such as "What ho, squire!" or "How's the good lady wife?"\par \par \uc2 In any case, Nigel should know better. The whole point of being English on a train is not speaking at all. If he did hear English being "audibly spoken" it was probably foreigners, anyway. No self-respecting Brit - at least not Nigel's type - would be caught mouthing off on a train. "Not a peep till Perivale" was the unspoken motto of the Central Line during my school days - and England was undoubtedly a better country for it. Even now, I wonder if the English he heard was not in fact the glottal twang of Australians on their way to a rugger match in Eltham.\par \par \uc2 This surely is the bigger issue for the Ukip members dreaming of the lost land just a few stops beyond Grove Park. No wonder they no longer recognise their own country. In the good old days for which they yearn, the only audibly spoken English one expected to hear on a busy commuter line was an apologetic "Excuse me" or the clipped tones of a lady asking a groper if he'd mind awfully removing his hand from her bottom. Not that Ukip is dogmatic about it; the party would always make an exception if Trevor Howard needs to talk urgently to Celia Johnson.\par \par \uc2 And yet, in our beastly modern country, the sensitive Ukip eardrum is not only assailed by foreign dialect but also by English accents discussing soccer or dinner arrangements on their mobiles as they trundle through Orpington - or perhaps the odd Ukip voter captured on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  ranting about the number of black faces in the carriage. This surely was the real point Nigel was making - it was a primal scream for the era of silent commuting, an era when all that was heard was the rustle of a newspaper and a sly chuckle over a solved crossword clue.\par \par \uc2 This is the social cohesion Nigel worries about: the inability to hear English people not speaking to each other. How could a Ukip member be reassured that indigenous Englishmen are ignoring each other in the time-honoured way if their silence is drowned out by other dialects?\par \par \uc2 And yet, with the right regulations, I am sure \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  could be persuaded to conform. Many of them are thoroughly good eggs who just need to understand that speaking on trains is frowned upon, especially if it is audible.\par \par \uc2 Yet this is where the authorities let us down. Migrants are taught the name of the patron saint of Scotland, yet never told to keep schtum on a train - especially if you see a ruddy-faced man in a dark suit, sitting nearby.\par \par \uc2 robert.shrimsley@ft.com; twitter.com/robertshrimsley\par \par \uc2 To comment on this article please post below, or email magazineletters@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020140307ea37003v1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 UK should scrap its migrant targets\b0\par\par\uc2 618 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 March 2014\par 18:48\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

One issue certain to create immense heat in the campaign is \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Opinion polls show British voters place the issue among their top three concerns, a reflection perhaps of the way migrant numbers have soared to record levels in the past decade. Public anxiety has boosted the UK Independence party, which garners votes with relentless attacks on migrants, especially from the EU.\par \par \uc2 To try to head off UKIP's challenge, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , prime minister, has adopted tough-sounding policies. His flagship pledge is to bring net migration - that is the difference between the number of people going into and out of the UK at any one time - down to the "tens of thousands" by next year's election. Conservative Home Office ministers have followed through, suggesting that migration damages the UK economy by taking jobs from British workers. Yet in the past few days, this entire Tory strategy has been undermined by two developments.\par \par \uc2 First, Mr Cameron's pledge on migrant numbers now looks impossible to achieve. Far from coming down to the tens of thousands, the latest data for 2012-13 show the net migrant figure rising to more than 200,000. This figure is actually shooting up for what might seem positive reasons. The UK economy is growing faster than European counterparts, so Britain is seeing a sudden surge in migrants from Italy, Spain and Portugal. But this merely highlights the fundamental flaw with Mr Cameron's pledge. So long as the UK remains part of the EU and has an open border policy, there is little he can do to reduce the net migration figure.\par \par \uc2 Then there is the allegation that migration displaces jobs. Back in 2012, Theresa May, home secretary, suggested that for every 100 migrants that came to the UK, there were 23 fewer jobs for British workers. This week, a hitherto suppressed government report stated that, in reality, there was "relatively little evidence that migration has caused significant displacement of UK natives . . . when the economy is strong". Besides, many economists are firmly of the view that the UK economy needs highly skilled migrants to boost growth.\par \par \uc2 It is time for Mr Cameron and the Conservatives to rethink their crude \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  strategy. They should replace the failing target on net migration with a system focused on attracting the skilled \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  that the UK urgently needs. Flows of migration that are obviously beneficial to the UK - such as investors, skilled professionals and students wanting to study in British universities - should be maximised. An Australia-style \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  points system should be put in place.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, as the \uc2 Institute for Public Policy Research\uc2  argued this week, the UK needs to close the door to migrants that the economy cannot accommodate. Britain should block the entry of low-skilled migrants from outside the EU, whose jobs can be done by EU nationals. The UK also needs an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy that is manifestly fair, slowing access to benefit entitlements and social housing for all new entrants.\par \par \uc2 Nobody should underestimate the fears that Britons have over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Young migrant families make it harder to find school places in communities. There are legitimate cultural concerns that need to be addressed by ensuring that migrants speak English and are properly integrated into local communities.\par \par \uc2 However, at some point in the future the UK will have to abandon its myopic policy for one that maximises the contribution that skilled foreign workers can make to the UK economy. For Mr Cameron to shift now would require political courage in the face of UKIP's ranting populism. But it is in Britain's interest.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020140307ea37003vd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Foreign nannies furore exposes gristly double standards\b0\par\par\uc2 John Harris   \par \uc2 theguardian.com\par \uc2 769 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par \uc2 Guardian.co.uk\par \uc2 GRULTD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Guardian News & Media Limited. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 John Harris: First thoughts: \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and Nick Clegg's use of overseas domestic staff shows the real issue of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 class\par \par \uc2 Had it not been for all those headlines about Stephen Lawrence and the Ellison review, many of today's papers may well have been a riot of outrage about the government and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . The story has unfolded through the week: a tale of mixed messages, plenty of cant, and wildly different experiences of the issue, depending on where you sit in the social hierarchy.\par \par \uc2 To recap: on Wednesday, the new Tory \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister James Brokenshire gave not-exactly-eagerly-awaited speech at the headquarters of thinktank Demos, outlining some of the ideas he is going to bring to a job he got when his predecessor, Mark Harper, resigned. Remember him? In the midst of all the government's tough posturing \u8211\'20\'13 those notorious 'Go home or face arrest' vans, for example \u8211\'20\'13 Harper learned he was employing an illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  as a domestic cleaner, and quit.\par \par \uc2 So, in came his replacement: an unremarkable-looking fella, straight out of Westminster central casting, who might reasonably have been expected to say very little of any consequence. But no: on Wednesday, his very pointed message was seemingly addressed to his predecessor, among others. Brokenshire had a pop at the "wealthy metropolitan elite" for their use of cheap labour from overseas, and duly sparked no end of coverage \u8211\'20\'13 including, by yesterday, news that among those wealthy metropolitan types he may have had in his sights were the prime minister and deputy prime minister. Nick Clegg, it transpires, employs a "lady" from Belgium as a home help; \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  has used nannies from Nepal and Australia.\par \par \uc2 The latter, one Sammi Strange, was apparently hired by the Camerons via a series of Skype interviews, like you do. At first, questions about her and the Camerons' domestic staffing arrangements were stonewalled, but it was then announced she had now become a UK citizen, and all was therefore tickety-boo. "We have always said we want people who want to work hard and get on," the prime minister's spokesperson said. "Do we want the brightest and the best? Yes we do. And that would absolutely include, for example, Mr and Mrs Cameron's nanny." So that's all right then.\par \par \uc2 The Labour MP John Mann is now demanding that the entire cabinet disclose how many domestic staff from overseas they employ, while the general public chews over some very gristly examples of double standards, and Nigel Farage \u8211\'20\'13 assuming, of course, there are no Lithuanian gardeners, Gambian nannies or Costa Rican cooks on his payroll \u8211\'20\'13 prepares to make hay. In the coming weeks, there may yet be further stories about ministers proving their commitment to tough \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policies and helping the benighted victims of unemployment by employing cheap domestic help from overseas: we shall see.\par \par \uc2 One other aspect of this story came earlier in the week, with an official report about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and its effects on the UK labour market, and the government's apparent attempt to sit on it. The resultant coverage reflected another habit of the wealthy metropolitan elite: reducing \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to a stupid numbers game \u8211\'20\'13 so that if you're of a liberal-left disposition you claim that new arrivals have little or no effect on wages and unemployment and thereby try and shut everyone up, while the right endlessly pledge to cut net levels of migration by this or that many thousand, to no appreciable effect.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, out in the real world, a very problematic reality has long taken hold, which only a small handful of politicians seem willing to talk about. The veteran Labour MP Frank Field, for example, recently said this: "A new servant class, equal to that of Downton Abbey times, has been recreated. It's not upstairs and downstairs any more, though. The elite bring the servant class in when they want cleaning done, ironing, gardening, decorating and so on." Brokenshire would presumably agree. He also thinks too much \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  threatens to "force wages down and house prices up and put pressure on social cohesion and public services."\par \par \uc2 You could put all that another way, in the kind of blunt language that most politicians choose to avoid, but that you can find buried in some speeches made a couple of years ago by Ed Miliband. "\b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is a class issue", he said in 2011. The words duly disappeared into the great mulch of public indifference, but how right that was.\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140307ea38000xg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

Karl Ove Knausgaard's unflinching six-volume account of his day-to-day life has also provoked legal action and death threats. Is he brave or shameless, asks Hari Kunzru\b0\par\par\uc2 Hari Kunzru   \par \uc2 3,882 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Sometime in 2006 or 2007, Karl Ove Knausgaard, an acclaimed novelist in his native Norway, discovered that he was sick of fiction. "It was a crisis," he wrote. "Just the thought of a fabricated character in a fabricated plot made me nauseous." The only genres of writing he still found valuable were diaries and essays, "the types of literature that just consisted of a voice, the voice of your own personality, a life, a face, a gaze you could meet". His solution was to embark on a massive project, a first-person narrative about his life that eventually ran to six volumes and 3,600 pages. He wrote at a feverish pace, publishing three books in 2009, two more the following year and a 1,000-page finale in 2011.\par \par \uc2 The reaction in Norway was unprecedented. By 2012, the books had sold 458,000 copies - a staggering figure in a country of 5 million people. Knausgaard's unflinching descriptions of his marriages, his father's alcoholism, his second wife's bipolar disorder and his conflicted feelings about fatherhood were profoundly shocking to the Lutheran sensibilities of a country that is less comfortable with public confessions than the Oprah-soaked anglophone world. Commentators obsessed over the new literary sensation. Was Knausgaard brave or shameless? Was it ethical to reveal so many other people's private lives along with his own? He received hate mail, death threats. His uncle started legal action. One Swede took the extreme critical step of setting fire to the K section of a Malmo bookstore, telling police that he did it because Knausgaard was "the worst author in the world". And what about the title - Min Kamp or My Struggle, a reference to Hitler's notorious autobiography? The final book (yet to appear in English) contains a 400-page essay on the Nazis and ends with a discussion of the anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  mass murderer Anders Breivik. What face was this man revealing? What kind of gaze did he want his readers to meet?\par \par \uc2 So far only the first three volumes of My Struggle have been translated, so it's hard for a non-Norwegian speaker to give a definitive answer to this question, but Knausgaard's reputation is already soaring in the English-speaking world, not least among writers. "I just finished the second volume of Karl Ove while high above the clouds in a plane," emailed one acclaimed novelist. "It was really one of the most sublime reading experiences of my adult life - almost equal to the kind I remember from childhood." "His arguments remind me why I got into this game in the first place," added another. I understood. I'd badgered Knausgaard's London editor for early copies, dispatched them in a few long sittings. But why? The commentary on My Struggle tends to focus, as I have in these paragraphs, on the phenomenon of the book's publication, rather than the writing itself. It is peculiarly difficult to get a grip on what makes the book so compelling, because much of it appears painfully banal. Knausgaard can spend pages describing cooking dinner, or his daughter's abstracted expression as he changes her nappy. He remembers teenage arguments with his father, making out with girls at parties. It is the stuff of an ordinary life, told without much embellishment, without much that declares itself (at least on first reading) as literary style.\par \par \uc2 Literature is usually considered to be something to do with heightened intensity. We call some kinds of language "poetic". We find some kinds of narrative "gripping" or "page-turning". So what are we to do with this?\par \par \uc2 I found a hairdresser's I hadn't seen when I passed by the first time, in a passage beside the big department store. I just had to take a seat. No wash, my hair was moistened with water from a spray. The hairdresser, an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , a Kurd I guessed, asked how I wanted it, I said short, indicated with my thumb and first finger how short I had in mind, he asked what I did, I said I was a student, he asked where I came from, I said Norway, he asked if I was here on holiday, I said yes, and that was it.\par \par \uc2 Knausgaard is capable of writing sharp, essayistic sentences:\par \par \uc2 Memory is pragmatic, it is sly and artful, but not in any hostile or malicious way; on the contrary, it does everything it can to keep its host satisfied. Something pushes a memory into the great void of oblivion, something distorts it beyond recognition, something misunderstands it totally, something, and this something is as good as nothing, recalls it with sharpness, clarity and accuracy. That which is remembered accurately is never given to you to determine.\par \par \uc2 He can also write lyrical description, the kind of prose it is easy to tag as "literature". But often he chooses to write as he does about his trip to the Stockholm hairdresser, scrupulously, with mild pedantry, about something mundane. However, these passages are often deceptive. When his haircut is finished, he looks down at the locks of hair on the floor around the barber's chair and makes an odd observation:\par \par \uc2 They were almost completely black. That was strange because when I looked in the mirror I had fair hair. It had always been like that. Even though I knew my hair was dark, I couldn't see it. I saw fair hair, as it had been in my boyhood and teens. Even in photos I saw fair hair.\par \par \uc2 So, Knausgaard thinks of himself as a blond. What of it? It is an incident that doesn't have any particular fallout. He never sees the Kurdish hairdresser again. The haircut is satisfactory. There is no revelation about his - what to call it? Hair dyschromia? - beyond the author's curiosity at the trick his memory and perception have played on him, and a slight note of unease at the gap between reality and his image of himself.\par \par \uc2 This is not boring in the way bad narrative is boring; it is boring in the way life is boring, and somehow, almost perversely, that is a surprising thing to see on the page. My Struggle (a slippery, self-ironising title) is composed of small incidents, some described at great length - 50 pages at a children's party, more about a teenage plan to hide some cans of beer one New Year's Eve. There are sections about more traumatic or intimate events - the harrowing job of cleaning up after his father's death, a drunken episode of self-cutting after a sexual rejection at a young writers' residential course - but Knausgaard appears to have shaped his narrative according to the "sly and artful" dictates of his memory. One has the sense that many significant things have been omitted, while seemingly insignificant things are being given undue or unlikely weight. In the first two volumes the narrative hops about between times and places, incorporating digressions about art and writing and the nature of remembering. The third is a more conventionally linear childhood memoir. What there isn't is a plot. The various events are allowed to take their own shape, without being forced into a conventional mould.\par \par \uc2 We are used to memoirs that read like bad novels, following certain familiar arcs. Survivors describe the obstacles they have surmounted to become the healthy, happy people they are today. The rich and famous take us with them on their rise to the top. Whistleblowers and the protagonists of scandals tell their forbidden secrets. In My Struggle, Knausgaard attempts something more disconcerting. He tries, as he puts it, to show his face. The incident of the dark hair speaks, like much in the book, to his search for a kind of self-knowledge that isn't in thrall to hackneyed narrative conventions or, crucially, to the near-universal desire to appear a certain way to others, to be admirable or heroic or simply likable. "The life I led was not my own," he writes. "I tried to make it mine, this was my struggle, because of course I wanted it, but I failed, the longing for something else undermined all my efforts."\par \par \uc2 The governing emotion of My Struggle is shame. When Knausgaard drunkenly cuts his face at the writers' residency, he tells us he had "never experienced such shame before". As a child he is ashamed of a floral bathing cap his parents make him wear to the pool. As a 24-year-old he is ashamed of his intense ambition, which he fears makes him ludicrous. As an aspiring writer, he is ashamed that he takes a well-known novelist's sarcasm for a compliment. Doing a TV interview, he decides his weakness for approbation is a personality flaw. "I was a whore," he writes. "This was the only suitable term."\par \par \uc2 This shame is bound up with his father, one of the great suburban monsters of literature. Knausgaard isn't beaten or sexually abused, but grows up in an atmosphere of grinding rectitude and pervasive bitterness. The older Knausgaard terrorises his two sons, his thwarted hopes finding expression as sarcasm (Karl Ove has a speech impediment, which is cruelly mocked) or eruptions of anger occasioned by the most minor infringements of discipline. When he loses a sock at swimming practice, Knausgaard is so afraid that he weeps. It is too simplistic to say that My Struggle is written to overcome a sense of worthlessness, but that is surely one of its driving impulses. It is also an act of self-shaming, a public display of wounds that has opened the author to accusations of narcissism and self\u8209\'20\'11aggrandisement.\par \par \uc2 Knausgaard's struggle with shame certainly feels genuine, though not altogether straightforward. If you are truly ashamed of something, do you share it? Doesn't sharing your shameful secret imply you take some pleasure in exposure, the flasher's thrill? But even if Knausgaard is serving his self\u8209\'20\'11revelation in a sauce of kink, it takes on more than therapeutic importance when one considers the way shame functions as a sort of barrier to authenticity. We do something in private - cheat or steal or tell a lie. If our moral failing is exposed, we feel shame, not because we have transgressed, but because we have been observed in our transgression. Shame is essentially public, and the near-universal desire to avoid it is an effective form of social regulation. So, if your artistic project is to look at yourself without shame (also, presumably, without vanity) in order to see yourself authentically, you must pay a social price. We deeply value the good opinion of others - at the limit it is all that keeps us safe from attack - and even if a writer's desire to overcome shame is sincere, it would be surprising, perhaps even pathological, were he to be able to overcome it fully and without pain. Seen like this, My Struggle becomes an almost political exercise in transparency, a response to the "always on" culture of cams and surveillance that has destroyed our old expectations of privacy.\par \par \uc2 Many critics treat My Struggle straightforwardly as memoir, praising it as some kind of unusually neutral transposition from life into art. In Norway it was published as a novel, a small provocation that the English-language publishers have dispensed with. Knausgaard is no James Frey, cashing in on the public's desire for sincere self-revelation by faking events and people that don't exist. But he is, inevitably, an unreliable narrator. How could he not be? We live a life of many dinners, many haircuts, many nappy changes. You can't narrate them all. You pick and choose. You (in the unlovely vernacular of our time) curate. There are also personal and legal pressures. Before publication, the manuscript of My Struggle was shown to people who appear as characters, and some asked to be taken out. Calling this book a novel wasn't (or wasn't just) some kind of legal fiction, but a warning to the unwary, to those who don't stop to consider that this is art. Knausgaard explores his relationships with his brother and father in depth, his mother less so. In reality, there is at least one other close relative who does not appear in the text and does not wish to be associated with the book or its author. Knausgaard's paternal uncle asked to have his name changed, and has attacked the project in the Norwegian press. Once one has started tugging at these threads, the idea that this is a neutral recollection begins to unravel.\par \par \uc2 Remembering the traumatic day his father tried to teach him to swim, Knausgaard specifies that he was wearing "the blue Las Palmas T-shirt I had been given by my grandparents". As they return to the car, his father carries a cooler bag, a life jacket and a wet towel. Knausgaard specifies the order in which they were placed in the boot. The author appears to have perfect recall, though of course he has already told us he is aware of the sly, artful tricks of memory. So are these details and the thousands like them invented? Are they perhaps collaged together or reconstructed? Part of Knausgaard's struggle is with truth and memory, a battle to reconstruct the past performed by someone using all the tools of the novel. In a memoir, one would call the missing relative a problem, a sin of omission, and ask, what is reality? Am I being fooled? In a novel, we apply different standards. We ask, what is this feeling of reality? It is visible to us as an aesthetic, an effect of artistic technique.\par \par \uc2 In an earlier passage, Knausgaard looks at paintings, trying to chase down a feeling he has in front of some but not others: certain works by Vermeer or the aged Rembrandt's self-portrait in the National Gallery, but not Rubens or Whistler or Michelangelo.\par \par \uc2 I don't know what it was about these pictures that made such a great impression on me. However it was striking that they were all painted before the 1900s, within the artistic paradigm that always retained some reference to visible reality. Thus, there was always a certain objectivity to them, by which I mean a distance between reality and the portrayal of reality, and it was doubtless in this interlying space where it 'happened', where it appeared, whatever it was I saw, when the world seemed to step forward from the world.\par \par \uc2 As a description of aesthetic realism, of how it seeks to function, this is very fine. The experience of reading My Struggle is that of the world seeming to step forward from the world. It is not the world mirrored or photocopied; its relationship to reality is less direct, less innocent. The book is the record of someone trying and failing (failing better, as Beckett has it) to make an accurate representation of himself; the gap between the world and that representation, between the world and itself, is the space where all sorts of questions about truth and personal identity arise.\par \par \uc2 There is a Nordic tradition of such writing, writing that seeks, at considerable length, to make the world step out from the world. Knausgaard himself nods to the Norwegian Modernist poet Olav Hauge, who lived his whole life in the same small coastal village and left a 4,000-page diary that he kept from the age of 15 until his death 70 years later. There is also the Finn Kalle Paatalo, whose 26-volume Iijoki series is considered the longest published autobiographical narrative in the world. Though it deals only with the author's life from birth to the publication of his first novel, a period largely spent in forestry and construction work in northern Finland, it is apparently very popular, earning Paatalo the nickname King of the Reprints. Knausgaard's most relentless public detractor is the novelist Ole Robert Sunde, whose own multi-volume autobiography (in progress since 1984) has received significantly less attention than his rival's, leading him to give bitter interviews in which he declares that he is the better writer, and is only less popular because his prose is technically demanding and he does not stoop to "lifting the duvet".\par \par \uc2 Knausgaard's second novel, written just before his crisis of fictional confidence, is A Time for Everything, an extravagant and compelling history of angels and their interactions with humans. Knausgaard's angels are wounded, tragic and, finally, debased, gradually degenerating as they fall away from God. The book retells several Old Testament stories, reimagining those that take place before the flood in a Norwegian landscape of fjords and forests. If a reader comes to it, as I did, after My Struggle, its exotic subject matter seems like a skin over a familiar body. Those two brothers, Cain and Abel. Loving, jealous, competing. Are they familiar? What about that wrathful God? There is a sense that the writer is using material from his own life, not as biographical details (though there is some of that too) but in the form of emotional dynamics, clusters of feelings and experiences. You find yourself thinking, yes, this is how brothers are. This is what it is to have an angry father. The two books, one that seems so flagrantly novelistic, the other so rigorously autobiographical, are actually far closer than they appear. The concern for personal authenticity is also part of a quest for purity. The sensibility attracted to writing about angels is clearly the same as that of the self-disgusted man who needs to tell the truth about his life.\par \par \uc2 When I look at a beautiful painting I have tears in my eyes, but not when I look at my children. That does not mean I do not love them, because I do, with all my heart, it simply means that the meaning they produce is not sufficient to fulfil a whole life. Not mine at any rate.\par \par \uc2 For writers who are also parents, Knausgaard wins points for facing up to the undeniable conflict between domestic life and work. His love for his children is portrayed with great tenderness, but he yearns to have more time to himself, to live "another kind of life". He strains at his bonds, eyeing up women, outraged at the thought that an attractive young teacher sees him as a sexless, unthreatening dad. At times, he finds his lot intolerable:\par \par \uc2 Everyday life, with its duties and routines, was something I endured, not a thing I enjoyed, nor something that was meaningful or made me happy. This had nothing to do with a lack of desire to wash floors or change nappies but rather with something more fundamental: the life around me was not meaningful. I always longed to be away from it, and always had done.\par \par \uc2 At times he can be very funny, describing himself striding about the city, a "19th-century man" seething with anger, a baby in a carrier strapped to his chest. He feels an affinity with the baroque, a period before life lost touch with "the essence". As Knausgaard drops off his kids at the state-run daycare, he grumbles about the emasculating effects of Scandinavian social democracy, to the sound of teeny-tiny violins from those of us who are not eligible for a year's parental leave at 100% of our salaries. His sociologist friend Geir, who seems to be his chief intellectual foil, writes a book about a boxing gym. "There the values that the welfare state had otherwise subverted, such as masculinity, honour, violence and pain, were upheld." Geir produces essays on such topics as Karl Jaspers' existential notion of the "limit Situation", and introduces Knausgaard to "the great classical antiliberal cultures, in a line extending from Nietzsche and Junger to Mishima and Cioran. There nothing was for sale, nothing could be measured in terms of monetary value . . ."\par \par \uc2 These are all fine writers and I am more than sympathetic to the idea that if we are to survive the age of neoliberal globalisation we need to revive non-economic conceptions of value, but when someone lines up this particular canon, all I see is a truckload of honourable violence and pain heading in my direction, driven by a man with very shiny buttons on his uniform. Knausgaard's unapologetic Romanticism, his love of Holderlin, his wish for an art in which "the flames of truth and beauty burn" heighten his sense of spiritual impoverishment, but also leave him receptive to the kind of neoreactionary ideas peddled by his friend. If the narrative of the decline of the angels is that of the spiritual gradually exhausting itself in the everyday, My Struggle seems animated by the desire to reawaken it, to infuse higher meaning into his own, ordinary life. The Hitlerian provocation of the title is thus more than a flippant joke, since it seems (at least from these volumes) that the author wishes to drink from the same wells of Nordic tradition as his predecessor. How far Knausgaard wishes to go with such flirtations will, I suppose, become clear as further volumes are translated. As a rootless cosmopolitan who has reason to be suspicious of appeals to authenticity, this is where I part company with his struggle, though not with his work, which I will continue to read - and argue with.\par \par \uc2 Interviewed by the Paris Review, Knausgaard told a story about a famous poet who was asked by a journalist whether, escaping from a burning building, he would take "the Rembrandt or the cat". He chose the cat. "I would do that too," said Knausgaard, but it is far from clear whether that is true. In a radio interview with his ex-wife, Tonje Aursland, he admitted he had made a Faustian bargain. "I have actually sold my soul to the devil. That's the way it feels. Because in addition I get such a huge reward." Aursland agrees with this assessment. "He has made a very clear choice, that this book is more important than having . . . a good relationship with family or a working relationship with his ex." There is no doubt that My Struggle has been bought at a price, both for the author and his loved ones, but for the reader, there is the thrill of confronting a passionate writer who is prepared to take such risks, to try to show his face as it is, rather than as he wishes it were.\par \par \uc2 Boyhood Island (My Struggle 3) is published this month by Harvill Secker.

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The prime minister's wife, \uc2 Samantha Cameron\uc2 , was named on a successful application for British citizenship by the family's nanny, who is of Nepalese origin, Downing Street confirmed last night.\par \par \uc2 As Labour called for complete transparency, Downing Street issued a statement saying Gita Lima had been awarded citizenship after \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  became prime minister in 2010. His wife did not endorse her application but was named as her employer in line with the normal procedure for such applications.\par \par \uc2 No 10 said: "Mr and Mrs Cameron's nanny became a British citizen in late 2010. Mr and Mrs Cameron did not write a letter supporting their nanny's application for British citizenship. The normal application process was followed throughout. As is usual, Mrs Cameron was named on her application as her employer."\par \par \uc2 The news that the prime minister's wife was named on the document, months after Cameron pledged to cap the number of non-EU \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , came as an embarrassment to No 10. Tory ministers who employ \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  as nannies have been mocked after James Brokenshire, the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, highlighted the way in which the "wealthy metropolitan elite" rely on cheap labour from overseas.\par \par \uc2 Phil Wilson, the Labour MP for Sedgefield, said: " There must now be complete transparency and openness from the prime minister over any contact between him, his office and the Home Office regarding his family's nanny."\par \par \uc2 The focus on the nanny angered Downing Street. Lima is regarded with great affection by the Camerons for her sensitivity towards their late son, Ivan, who was severely disabled. Sources said Lima came to Britain as part of a scheme to help victims of domestic slavery.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140308ea380007k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Clegg sends troops towards anti-EU gunfire: Leader hopes to present Lib Dems as a principled 'Stop Farage' party\b0\par\par\uc2 Patrick Wintour Political editor   \par \uc2 1,242 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In perhaps the most cited speech of any Liberal leader, Jo Grimond closed the Liberal assembly in 1963, ahead of the 1964 election, with the promise: "I intend to march my troops to the sound of gunfire".\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg, as he faces the European elections in May, has set his party on the same course. Faced with ever growing hostility to the EU, and to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , Clegg has decided to present the Liberal Democrats unambiguously as the party of "in" and of openness. He wants to be seen in these elections as the Stop Farage candidate and to make the debate about the very character of Britain. The planned TV debate with the Ukip leader will give him a chance not just to stand up to Farage, but to stand up for a Britain that does not want to hide.\par \par \uc2 There is an element of calculation in this. In a crowded field the Liberal Democrats risk being ignored and dumped into fourth place with Ukip replacing the Lib Dems as the amorphous party of protest. The Lib Dems may well be the party of in, but also come polling day the party of out, with all 12 of its MEPs expelled from the European parliament. It's not an outcome that Clegg discounts, saying simply if he is to lose any of his MEPs the thing he would hate most is losing them without a fight.\par \par \uc2 But this stance is also about Clegg as a person. One poll asked people this week to choose a single character trait that encapsulates Clegg: the answer came back simply, "liar". The stain of his U-turn on tuition fees appears to be indelible. The European elections at least give Clegg a chance to prove there are principles on which he will not compromise, no matter what the cost.\par \par \uc2 In an interview before his spring party conference in York, Clegg puts it like this: "The two main parties in this country no longer have anything meaningful to say about Europe. Labour seems to be enjoying sitting on its hands and in a rather cowardly manner failing to make the internationalist case at all. The Conservatives are deeply divided between a significant part that agrees with Ukip, and another part casting around for ideas to keep them in the EU, so Labour and the Conservatives are split or confused, or completely lost the courage of their convictions.\par \par \uc2 "When big parties create vacuums like that they get filled and they are being filled by the two other parties. Whether you agree with us or not, at least we have the merit of having clear and consistent views on this."\par \par \uc2 He argues the conflicting visions being offered by the Lib Dems and Ukip encapsulate a profound new fault line in British and European politics about how to respond to globalisation. "The irony is that you have got the two smaller parties telling the country what the choice is, and the choice increasingly is whether we remain in or not. It is the same choice in Dutch, French and German politics - do you respond to globalisation by being open or closed?"\par \par \uc2 All this represents a wider trend. "My own view is that the dividing line - open/closed, engaged/disengaged - is increasingly emerging as a more important fault line in contemporary politics than the old language with which we used to slice and dice political parties.\par \par \uc2 "It used to be left/right, market/state, north/south, the bosses/workers. So in many ways what you are seeing in British politics and elsewhere strikes right at the identity of the nation state. In the footloose, fancy-free world do you think, however difficult it might be, it's better to get stuck in, to be engaged and be open, or do you seek to draw up the drawbridge? That will be the big story after the European elections. What is the general mood in Europe ? Is it one of introversion and chauvinism?"\par \par \uc2 Although Clegg will descend into the usual knockabout concerning Ukip's voting record in the European parliament, he is absolutely adamant he will not dismiss the well of anxiety from which Ukip draws. Indeed he says that anxiety is logical and "a profound instinct" that he "acknowledges, respects and understands".\par \par \uc2 "At a time of economic insecurity, in the wake of this massive cardiac arrest we suffered back in 2008, because of all of the anxieties associated with globalisation where people feel their lives are being affected by forces which they can't control, I think it is totally logical actually that some people will find it quite seductive when a politician says, 'it's someone else's fault and all your anxieties can be lifted from your shoulders if only we just shut the door'.\par \par \uc2 In contrast to \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , he says: "I've never dismissed Ukip as nutters and fruitcakes. I take what they represent deadly seriously and, by the way, I wouldn't be having a debate with Nigel Farage unless I took what he says very, very seriously." But he says his job is to ask people to think through what Farage is offering. However tempting the emotional reflex, the consequence of Ukip "would be much higher levels of unemployment, much higher levels of poverty, much greater levels of insecurity, a hugely diminished ability to deal with things like cross-border crime, to tackle climate change and a massive diminution in our influence in the world".\par \par \uc2 But Clegg also says he is not going to be cowed into taking Cameron's Trappist vow of silence about Farage's assertion that he finds Britain unrecognisable and is uncomfortable at the lack of English spoken on commuter trains out of Charing Cross.\par \par \uc2 "Modern Britain should not be a subject of despair, far from it. I think the fact that we have communities which are so diverse and that you can have people squashed together like sardines in the London tube from different backgrounds, different cultures, different skin colours, different traditions, different perspectives and still do so peaceably and generously to each other I think is a great thing. Farage wants to turn the clock back, he doesn't like modern Britain, he wants to dismiss so many of the big modern features of modern life - I want to embrace them."\par \par \uc2 With 15 months to go, Clegg may feel the die is cast for the general election. He is offering a centrist party in coalition anchoring the Conservatives in compassion and Labour in fiscal discipline.

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Saturday Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 Life after Benefits Street: Deirdre Kelly, better known as 'White Dee' became a household name after her starring role in Channel 4's hit series Benefits Street. Since then the offers have been flooding in. This is the story of what happened next ...: Life after Benefits Street\b0\par\par\uc2 The Saturday interview By Decca Aitkenhead   \par \uc2 2,185 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Broadcasting House in central London is less than 120 miles away from James Turner Street, but the expression on its most famous resident's face suggests she has landed on another planet. Through the window she gazes out at a great kerfuffle of cameras and lights as a One Show presenter is filmed abseiling off the roof. At a nearby table a pair of journalists are loudly discussing Syria. Opposite her sits a garrulous fellow called Barry, who looks like he could be an old mate of Ozzy Osbourne, finds everything funny, keeps mouthing "I love you" at me, and is here in his capacity as her newly appointed manager and agent. In less than three hours she will be interviewed live on Newsnight.\par \par \uc2 Had anyone described this scene to Deirdre Kelly 10 weeks ago, she would have thought they were mad. Back then she thought she was about to appear in a Channel 4 documentary about community spirit in her rundown neighbourhood. She didn't expect to feature much in the series, nor imagine that many people would watch. But as the standout star of C4's ratings sensation Benefits Street, White Dee became a household name overnight. Vilified by critics as the "patron saint of drug addicts and dropouts", and lauded by fans as a working-class hero, hers is the latest - and possibly least likely - life to be turned inside out by a television show.\par \par \uc2 "I've had offers from all over the world for all sorts of things," she marvels. "Modelling, newspaper columns, cooking, holidays. I've just recorded a rap record with an up-and-coming band. I can't fathom it all out, to be honest with you. I'm just like: 'Why me?'"\par \par \uc2 The only explanation Dee can come up with for our fascination with her is that viewers can relate to her. "I think a lot of people have seen that I'm exactly like them. I'm just an ordinary, everyday person." But that's not how many high-profile critics saw the heavy-smoking, frequently swearing, single mother of two. Journalists and politicians who'd expressed horror while the series was on air subsequently came face-to-face with Dee in two live TV debates, where it quickly became apparent that they were rather frightened of her. "To them," she observes, "I'm the unknown, aren't I? I don't know if they're just stuck in their little bubble, or what," - and in that she may well have put her finger on the key to the current anti-benefits discourse. It's only possible to draw sweeping conclusions about welfare from a heavily edited portrayal of one woman on the telly if she is literally unrecognisable as a human being.\par \par \uc2 In fact, Dee is enormously likable. Unaffected yet knowing, she is very direct and can be extremely funny, with a natural gift for comic timing. She is also one of the most tolerant, least judgmental people I've ever met, and remarkably pragmatic about the hand she has been dealt. She is still angry with the programme's makers and believes they lied about the sort of documentary they wanted to make, "but I'm not complaining about the way I've been portrayed, because obviously, hopefully, it will lead to things that will be good for my children". For the first time in her life, she is in a position to command attention, and is now trying to work out what to do with it. "The show did us bad - but no one would really give two hoots about what I had to say before. If we can make good out of it, then brilliant."\par \par \uc2 Dee felt she'd been deceived when she discovered that they'd called the series Benefits Street just two weeks before it went on air. When residents were shown episode one, "we couldn't believe what we were watching. We went mad. People growing drugs, smoking drugs, shoplifting. That is not what our street is about. Half the people they showed don't even live in our street. We knew from that second that we were well and truly screwed over by them." But she was still completely unprepared for its impact.\par \par \uc2 Within 12 hours of episode one being broadcast, reporters were mobbing her house, eggs were pelted at her door from passing cars, and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  was awash with "pure hatred, vicious hatred. It was horrible, really really horrible." The notoriously unkind social commentator Katie Hopkins delivered the most wounding blow, calling her a bad mum whose children should be taken into care. Dee's wounded indignation is equalled only by her bewilderment at this presumption of entitlement to judge.\par \par \uc2 "She doesn't know me," she keeps saying. "I've never expressed such a hurtful opinion towards someone I don't know, or their children. I wouldn't look at someone and say: 'Oh my God, I don't like the look of you.'" When I ask what kind of behaviour or lifestyle she would consider beyond the pale in a neighbour, she struggles to think of anything - "that's a tough one, that is" - and eventually comes up with sex offending. "I'm just not a 'bad terms' kind of person. I don't really harbour any bad feeling for anybody." Until five years ago she was an office worker, but when I ask how she used to feel about people on benefits, the question makes no sense to her. "I didn't feel anything about people on benefits, because that's their situation, and you don't know everyone's circumstances. So I honestly didn't feel anything."\par \par \uc2 Had the series been about any other street in Britain, she would never have watched it. "No, because you've got a programme labelled Benefits Street - in my mind, whoever's going to be on that show is going to be made a fool of, 'cos that's what they normally do. Benefits is just a situation that you're in at that time, and everyone's circumstances are different; everyone has different reasons for being on benefits. So we can't just judge everybody as one. So I would never watch a show called Benefits Street, 'cos I can't stand watching someone be belittled in TV shows or documentaries."\par \par \uc2 One of the most striking things about Dee is that she makes no attempt to spin her own story for sympathy. The daughter of Irish \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , she describes her childhood as "amazing"; her father always worked, her mother was a housewife, and she joined a youth training scheme the day she turned 16. Her relationship with the father of her 16-year-old daughter, Caitlin, lasted for 12 years, until "something happened and I had to get him to leave", but she won't elaborate. "I could make him look bad, but I'm not going to. The past is the past."\par \par \uc2 Following Caitlin's birth, she was diagnosed with postnatal depression, but dismissed it until her mother died two years ago, at which point she went to pieces. At first she tried to conceal her depression, but she is now under the care of a mental health team, who have put her on antidepressants but doubt that the bereavement explains her condition, and suspect she may be bipolar. She hasn't even been able to visit her father since her mother died. She gets as far as his front door but then panics, and has to go home. "I just can't do it. I can't go in, 'cos she's not there. He's 75 and he has to visit me. That's awful, isn't it?"\par \par \uc2 Critics have accused her of playing the depression card to get out of work, because we never saw her looking unwell on Benefits Street. But depression, Dee points out, is not exactly telegenic, so of course it was edited out. I don't think Channel 4 are entirely to blame for obscuring the extent of her illness, however, for I get the impression that Dee herself is embarrassed to talk about it. She talks in vague terms of having "down days", and only acknowledges a paralysis of overwhelmingly bleak despair when I probe gently for details. She had been due to appear on Newsnight three days earlier, but was too unwell to manage the journey from Birmingham, let alone a media interview, so had to cancel. "I don't like letting people down, and that's what happened last week. I weren't well. But then I felt so bad and guilty, 'cos I'd let people down, and that just made it even worse." When the Newsnight presenter challenged Dee on air about why she wasn't fit to work, I expected to hear her point out the previous cancellation, but she didn't even mention it.\par \par \uc2 Dee now finds herself in a slightly surreal predicament. Having been on benefits for five years, she is being bombarded with all sorts of lucrative offers that many celebrities would kill for. "Everybody knows where I live, so they were just coming through the door with everyday post, and I would just open them and go, 'Oh my god', and then close them and put them in a pile. I haven't got a clue how things work. I've never mixed in these circles. I just get the kids up for school, cook them dinner, get them to bed, get up the next day and do exactly the same."\par \par \uc2 So when a friend put her in touch with Barry, it was quite a relief. A local music publicist, he cuts an eccentrically comedic figure, and seems to suit her very well, but Dee still isn't sure what to do about the offers. She can't commit to anything because she can never predict if she will be well, so it's impossible to make plans. "How do you decide anything? I don't know. Everything that comes in I think, 'Well, that's a joke,' but it's not a joke. It's deadly serious."\par \par \uc2 It's been widely reported that she plans to stand as an independent candidate in her constituency at the next election, but in fact what she said is that she would run against Kwasi Kwarteng, a Tory MP who denounced her as "too common for the House of Commons". But I'd be very surprised if that actually happens. When I ask if she wants her life to change radically, the long pause says as much as her eventual response. "I don't know. I still want to be me. If it impacts on my children, then no."\par \par \uc2 Then again, Dee would love to be able to take her children on holiday. "Mum used to pay for us to go to like Skegness or Weston-super-Mare. If it weren't for mum and dad, my children would have probably never ever had a holiday." Before Benefits Street, her biggest worries had been her children's birthdays and Christmas. "What can I buy them? They're not children who want want want, but as a parent the guilt's for you, not for them." I ask what her biggest worries are now, and she says, "Still the same. 'Cos I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what the future's going to hold. I just want my children to succeed in life."\par \par \uc2 Dee knows she could spend at least the next few years earning lots of money as a professional reality TV contestant. There has already been excitable interest from Big Brother and I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!, and critics on the right might well say she is morally obliged to accept their offers. How can she continue to take money from the state, when she has these golden opportunities? But those same critics also accuse her of being a feckless bad mother, so I wonder what they would make of her answer. "I could do those shows. But I'm not going to sacrifice my kids. I've never been without my kids. I'm a parent first."\par \par \uc2 If it weren't for her responsibilities as a mother, would the reality circuit appeal to her? "Course it would!" she laughs. "People offering to throw money at me for this, that and the other? But it's not all about the money. I'm not the type of person who would give up being a proper mum just for money."\par \par \uc2 Continued on page 26 \u8805\'22\'65\par \par \uc2 \u8804\'22\'64 Continued from page 23\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Deirdre Kelly, main, and above, with her daughter, Caitlin, on Channel 4's Benefits Street\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140308ea38000cn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Danny Alexander tipped to replace Vince Cable in Lib Dem role\b0\par\par\uc2 By George Parker in York   \par \uc2 729 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par 00:10\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

But his choice will say much about the party's economics stance at the next election.\par \par \uc2 Mr Alexander is closely associated with the Treasury's tough fiscal "Plan A" and has implemented the coalition's public spending cuts, while Mr Cable is sceptical about further big cuts to balance the books.\par \par \uc2 "Danny has been so closely chained to the Treasury mast that our distinctive Lib Dem economic message just won't be credible if he leads for us on it instead of Vince at the election," said Lord Oakeshott, the party's former Treasury spokesman in the Lords and a friend of Mr Cable.\par \par \uc2 Another senior Lib Dem MP said he feared that in any televised "chancellor's debates" in the run up to the 2015 election, Mr Alexander would lack credibility attacking Mr Osborne, after serving as his deputy.\par \par \uc2 At the last election Mr Cable was in charge of the party's economic message and was seen as such an asset to the party that he featured alongside Mr Clegg on the party's manifesto cover and on the side of its election battle bus.\par \par \uc2 But the two men have grown apart in government. Mr Cable feared that Plan A was undercutting vital investment and has criticised the Treasury's Help to Buy housing scheme. He is also the party's most vocal critic of the banks. At last year's party conference he signalled his disquiet over Lib Dem economic policy by letting it be known he might be too busy to turn up to vote for it. Eventually he did, but his behaviour infuriated Mr Clegg.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cable, aged 70, has lost none of his appetite for politics and friends think he would love to hold an economics job - even chancellor - in a coalition with Labour, a party he belonged to for many years.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Mr Alexander, aged 41, has become indispensable to Mr Clegg. He sits with Mr Clegg in the coalition's ruling "quad" and was this week put in charge of his party's coalition negotiating team, in the event of a hung parliament in 2015.\par \par \uc2 "Of course Danny will be the lead economics spokesman at the election," said one senior Lib Dem MP close to Mr Clegg. "He will have been a Treasury minister for five years."\par \par \uc2 But Mr Cable said: "The roles have not been decided. It would be very presumptuous of anyone to second guess what the leader wants to do."\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, Mr Alexander has adopted a more hostile stance towards the Tories, including saying he would let the them cut the top rate of income tax to 40p "over my dead body".\par \par \uc2 In a speech to the party's spring conference on Saturday he will say that the Lib Dems' top priority in any coalition negotiations at the next election would be a promise to raise the income tax threshold from \u163\'00\'A310,000 to \u163\'00\'A312,500, giving a \u163\'00\'A3500 tax cut to "working people".\par \par \uc2 He has also joined Mr Cable in pushing for a more liberal \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy; Mr Alexander wrote to Theresa May last month urging her to let in more foreign engineers and scientists to meet a skills gap.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg is expected to announce his party's election line-up in the autumn, but he knows he will have to treat Mr Cable with care, not least because the business secretary continues to be popular in his party and with the public.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cable has refused to rule out a future bid for the Lib Dem leadership, but told the Independent newspaper on Friday that there was no question of the leadership coming into question before the 2015 election.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140308ea380005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News\par \par \uc2 Downing Street has been forced to check how a foreign\u8209\'20\'11born nanny employed by David and \uc2 Samantha Cameron\uc2  came to be a British citizen, after a backfiring speech by a Conservative MP.\par \par \uc2 James Brokenshire, the newly appointed \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, gave a speech this week that appeared to blame the "wealthy metropolitan elite" for jeopardising the employment prospects of working-class Britons by employing foreign staff.\par \par \uc2 The Camerons have never made a secret of the fact that they employed a Nepalese\u8209\'20\'11born nanny, Gita Lima, who has worked with them for years and moved with them into Downing Street.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Brokenshire's comments have exposed the Prime Minister to a charge of hypocrisy for doing exactly what his minister was railing against. Questions were also raised yesterday about whether the decision to grant British citizenship to the nanny had been influenced by the fact that the Prime Minister's family pay her wages.\par \par \uc2 Phil Wilson, a Labour whip, said: "There must now be complete transparency and openness from the Prime Minister over any contact between him, his office and the Home Office regarding his family's nanny. There should not be any delay in providing this information, so that people can be assured that he has acted appropriately."\par \par \uc2 After some delay, Downing Street confirmed that \uc2 Samantha Cameron\uc2  had been named as the nanny's employer on her application form. But it said neither of the Camerons had written a letter to support her application.\par \par \uc2 Nine years ago the Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett resigned after it was revealed that an email sent from his office had apparently helped fast-track a visa application by a Filipina nanny employed by a woman the minister had an affair with.\par \par \uc2 Downing Street has denied any parallel between the two cases. Mr Brokenshire's comments, in a speech on Thursday, could cause problems for other ministers, after the Labour MP John Mann demanded that every cabinet minister should say "what staff they have employed from abroad".\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, was asked on his weekly LBC radio phone\u8209\'20\'11in show whether he employs any foreign staff. His initial reaction was to refuse to answer, but later he said that one of his staff is Belgian.\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire's predecessor as \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, Mark Harper, resigned after he discovered that he had been employing an illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  to clean his flat.\par \par \uc2 In his first speech since his appointment, Mr Brokenshire told a meeting organised by the think-tank, Demos: "For too long, the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour; or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services - but not to the ordinary, hard-working people."\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140308ea380000w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Comment\par \b \uc2 Banging on about Europe used to be a problem for Clegg. These days it's the Lib Dems' number one selling point\b0\par\par\uc2 Andrew Grice   \par \uc2 1,074 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par \uc2 The Independent\par \uc2 IND\par \uc2 1ST\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Comment | Inside Westminster\par \par \uc2 "Cameron says jump, Clegg says 'how high?'" That is how voters in a recent focus group conducted for the Conservative Party characterised the relationship between the Prime Minister and his deputy. Similarly, the Tory polling finds that most voters believe the Liberal Democrats - and especially Nick Clegg - sold their souls to get into government.\par \par \uc2 The finding that most cheered some Tory strategists is that many voters do not think it credible that the Lib Dems forced the Tories to implement a policy they opposed - the \u163\'00\'A310,000-a-year personal tax allowance which takes effect next month. In any case, most people don't really think of \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's administration as a coalition. They regard it as "the Government", and see its figureheads as Cameron and \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  rather than Clegg.\par \par \uc2 The polling helped to persuade the Chancellor to embark on a shameless act of political grand larceny. He is claiming ownership of the \u163\'00\'A310,000 personal allowance, and will probably trumpet a further rise for next year (which Clegg has already demanded) in his Budget on 19 March. Never mind that the policy was on the front cover of the Lib Dems' manifesto in 2010, and their top priority in the negotiations on the Coalition Agreement. Forget the fact that Cameron told Clegg during the leaders' TV debates in 2010: "We cannot afford it."\par \par \uc2 As the Lib Dems hold their spring conference in York this weekend, their senior figures are seething about what they call "a naked attempt" to steal their flagship policy. They will use the event to shout from the rooftops that raising the tax allowance was their idea, and that they have had to fight hard for every increase in it since 2010. "We are going to take this policy back," one Lib Dem aide said yesterday.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems' own polling is not as gloomy for them as the Tories' research. Among their target voters, including those who have deserted the party, there is a recognition that they pressed for the tax cut. But one Clegg adviser admitted: "We still have work to do to convince people. We are going to bang on about this until we are blue in the face."\par \par \uc2 The tax battle highlights the perils of being the smallest party in a coalition government. When the Lib Dems joined the Coalition in 2010, their Liberal counterparts in other European countries warned them there was a risk they would get the blame for unpopular policies but not reap much benefit from the good news. Indeed, there are plenty of examples of the junior coalition partner doing badly at the following general election.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, the Lib Dems have turned up the volume when they "differentiate" from the Tories. Even "coalitionist" ministers like Danny Alexander at the Treasury and David Laws at Education have been pressed into action. Some rows with the Tories are choreographed but increasingly they are not. However, there is a limit to how far they can go without making the Government look shambolic, undermining the party's need to show that "coalition works".\par \par \uc2 The Tories are irritated by the attacks but believe their best strategy is to ignore them. "The Lib Dems can have their hissy-fits; we are the grown-ups getting on with governing," one Tory minister said.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, Tories mocked the forthcoming TV and radio debates between Clegg and Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party, on whether Britain should be in or out of the EU. The Lib Dem leader is gambling by making the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  elections in May about Europe. That may sound odd, but it breaks one of the rules of the political game: there are few votes in "banging on" about Europe. (The success of Ukip surely stems from the party combining Europe with the much more potent issue of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , and becoming the "none of the above" party now that the Lib Dems are "one of the above".)\par \par \uc2 In the past, when the Europhile Clegg told his advisers he wanted to make a speech about Europe, they would try to talk him out of it. Not now. As the Tory polling shows, Clegg needs to get noticed. If taking to Farage helps, so be it. The Lib Dems are appealing to the quarter of the electorate who are pro-EU. Putting it crudely, 25 per cent is better than the party's 10 per cent rating in the polls.\par \par \uc2 They won't only "bang on" about Europe. Tax will provide a useful balance: as a pocket-book issue, it will have a better chance of resonating with Joe Public.\par \par \uc2 The Tories would love the Lib Dems to disappear: hence their talk of restricting next year's TV election debates to Cameron and Miliband, a battle of the heavyweights without Clegg. That would be outrageous. Perhaps it is just a Tory ruse to stop the debates happening.\par \par \uc2 The bad news for the Tories is that Clegg is not going to disappear. Love them or hate them, the Lib Dems are still in the game.\par \par \uc2 Old boy Tories with domestic issues\par \par \uc2 The recent news story which most got under \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's skin was a Financial Times report that some Tory MPs are worried the party's manifesto is being written by a cabal of Old Etonian advisers.\par \par \uc2 Number 10 went to great lengths to insist that several others from different backgrounds will be closely involved. Yet the stories just keep on coming.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, Downing Street had to answer Labour charges of "hypocrisy" after confirming that Cameron employs Gita Lima, a Nepalese-born nanny. It is under pressure to say whether the PM helped her with citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Labour MPs want to know which Cabinet ministers also employ migrants. This "Nannygate" affair was self-inflicted. In his first speech as \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister, James Brokenshire criticised the "wealthy metropolitan elite" who rely on cheap domestic labour. I am not sure how that slipped past the Number 10 censors, but it did.\par \par \uc2 Tory backbenchers are increasingly irritated by such unforced errors. One told me: "I don't care where people went to school. But the 'posh boy' stuff is damaging us. We need to come up with policies that show we know what's happening in the real world."\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140308ea380003x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News | Editorials Migrants bring more benefits than our leaders will admit\par \par \uc2 Are the rich the only ones who benefit from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , as the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, James Brokenshire, claims in his maiden intervention on the subject? And if they are, where does that leave the Camerons' Nepalese nanny?\par \par \uc2 To be fair to Mr Brokenshire - who has only recently migrated to his new role - it is true that the "metropolitan elite" tends to be found in the sort of occupations where there is little serious competition from abroad. The average newspaper columnist, for example, is not liable to be displaced by a Bulgarian willing to spout nonsense for a much smaller fee. You do not tend to hear of eye surgeons claiming foreigners have taken "their" jobs. And yet the professional classes do gain the benefit of cheaper cleaners, taxi drivers, plumbers, builders and all the other trades that migrants tend to be found in. And indeed, the nannying.\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire says British workers are losing jobs and seeing their wages driven down by this increase in supply. The evidence for this is slight, but even if there is an effect, we never allowed this to stand in the way of our marked appetite for foreign cars and holidays. If we were so obsessed with protecting jobs and keeping wages high, for car workers and hoteliers, say, we would have erected punitive tariffs on imports long since.\par \par \uc2 In fact, everyone gains from the higher economic growth migration brings, as it boosts tax returns, supports public spending and promotes employment. A poor family with a broken boiler is glad of a plumber it can afford, no matter where he or she comes from. The truth is that migrants tend to be younger, healthier and single, and make relatively little call on public services.\par \par \uc2 As a spokesman for the Camerons said yesterday about their Nepalese nanny, now a British citizen: "We have always said we want people who want to work hard and get on. Do we want the brightest and the best? Yes we do. And that would absolutely include, for example, Mr and Mrs Cameron's nanny as someone who wants to work hard and get on." Not an elitist view, that.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140308ea380005f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Comment\par \b \uc2 Everyone is shocked by the inquiry into police corruption - except the public\b0\par\par\uc2 ELLEN E JONES   \par \uc2 742 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par \uc2 The Independent\par \uc2 IND\par \uc2 1ST\par 37\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Comment | Another Voice\par \par \uc2 Mark Ellison QC reported back from his inquiry into police corruption in the Stephen Lawrence case this week and it wasn't hard to read the mood in government. Home Secretary Theresa May immediately ordered a further public inquiry. Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  tweeted: "Like the Home Secretary, I find the conclusions of the Stephen Lawrence review profoundly shocking." Even Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey said there could be no serving police officer who would not be "saddened, shocked, and very troubled". It seemed the only public figure who felt differently was the one closest to the case. "I'm not shocked," said Stephen's mother, Baroness Lawrence. "It's something I suspected all along."\par \par \uc2 Anyone who has followed the Lawrence case closely must also have long suspected police corruption. This newspaper reported on the specific allegations against Detective Sergeant John Davidson in 2012, and the confirmation that police could stoop so low as to spy on bereaved family members is not a new revelation either. In July 2013, Humberside Police admitted that it had conducted surveillance on the family of Christopher Alder, a 37-year-old black man who died in its custody. An investigation by the \uc2 Independent Police Complaints Commission\uc2  (IPCC) is yet to hold any officers accountable for improper surveillance. That should not shock you either.\par \par \uc2 The record for deaths in police custody is a good example of IPCC effectiveness. There were 1,476 deaths following police contact between 1990 and January 2014; despite the duty to refer every such case to the IPCC, no officer has been successfully prosecuted. Only PC Simon Harwood, who was found not guilty of killing Iain Tomlinson in 2012, received any sort of professional sanction. This is the same IPCC, of course, that said it could find no evidence of the Met withholding information from the Macpherson Inquiry, evidence which has now been presented by Ellison.\par \par \uc2 British society used to be divided into those who instinctively trusted the police as friendly neighbourhood bobbies and those who instinctively distrusted the police as power-abusing pigs. Then plebgate happened and a distinction once drawn along race and class lines became blurry. From the point of view of the Met, perhaps the greatest folly of the whole foolish affair was how it created a point of commonality between a 57-year-old, Rugby-educated Tory MP and a teenage boy from Brixton. A young man interviewed on Thursday's Newsnight said he was first stopped and searched by police at the age of 11. "Since then I've despised them more and more because for me they are like criminals in fancy dress... They've got such a big mob mentality."\par \par \uc2 For a government newly alive to evidence of this "mob mentality", professing shock at police corruption isn't enough. Nor is ordering yet another inquiry when all the inquiries, investigations and reports thus far have failed to hold a single officer to account.\par \par \uc2 The key target of this new inquiry, Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), was disbanded in 2008, but later reformed as the National Domestic Extremism Unit. Richard Walton, the officer who fielded the Lawrence camp spy known only as "N81", is now head of the Met's Counter-Terrorism Command. Just as the British far-right has developed new targets in line with government anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rhetoric, so it seems the same police force which covered up racism and corruption during the Macpherson Inquiry has shape-shifted to better suit the post-9/11 priorities of those in power.\par \par \uc2 Police spying certainly merits its own inquiry, but the issue of "institutional racism" identified in 1999 hasn't gone away just because we have a shiny new report to pore over. It is evident still in the disproportionate amount of ethnic minority deaths in custody and in the practice of stop and search which discriminates against black people by a multiple of six to one. To Theresa May's credit, she has promised reform on this issue. To the discredit of unspecified powers, this reform has been indefinitely delayed.\par \par \uc2 In this context, all the talk of "shock" is cheap. The Government must address its own part in creating a culture of police impunity. Until then, when DS Dodgy acts like he can get away with anything, that's probably because he can.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @MsEllenEJones\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140308ea380006s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FILMS OF THE WEEK FILM CHOICE\par \par \uc2 Friday\par \par \uc2 Before Midnight\par \par \uc2 11AM & 10PM SKY MOVIES PREMIERE\par \par \uc2 (Richard Linklater, 2013) It's one of the themes of Before Midnight that love stories and fairy tales are hardly ever the same thing. Still, two decades after Before Sunrise, the semi-improvised almost-romance in which they first met, Jesse and C\u233\'00\'E9line (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, above) are now enjoying a family holiday in the Peloponnese. The first half of this perceptive relationships comedy consists of lively, free-ranging conversations about literature and generational and gender differences, before simmering resentments are brought to a boil and it turns into Gen-X's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? ****\par \par \uc2 Saturday\par \par \uc2 Spring Breakers\par \par \uc2 10PM SKY MOVIES SELECT\par \par \uc2 (Harmony Korine, 2012) This film about the behaviour of four young women in bikinis during their college spring break features more sunshine, drugs, guns, neon and naked flesh than Scarface and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City put together. But the action takes place in a woozy, experimental dream-state, and the inscrutability of the film's moral stance makes it at least as troubling as it is exhilarating. ****\par \par \uc2 Sunday\par \par \uc2 Dancer in the Dark\par \par \uc2 1.05AM FILM4\par \par \uc2 (Lars von Trier, 2000) The concluding part of Lars von Trier's "Golden Heart" trilogy of films about saintly, suffering women stars Bj\u246\'00\'F6rk as an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  factory worker in Sixties rural America, saving for her son's eye operation. Her performance and her musical score and songs are all excellently realised, and it's a very potent - albeit self-consciously manipulative - musical melodrama. ****\par \par \uc2 Monday\par \par \uc2 Blue Valentine\par \par \uc2 11PM FILM4\par \par \uc2 (Derek Cianfrance, 2010) Cutting between the beginning of a love affair and its bitter end, this grungy indie take on Scenes from a Marriage is about how, almost without noticing, people can find themselves living the exact kinds of lives they hadn't wanted to. It is so naturalistic and truthful, and the performances by Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling are so intense and unguarded, that it almost feels indecent to witness. *****\par \par \uc2 Tuesday\par \par \uc2 The Silence of the Lambs\par \par \uc2 10.30PM ITV4\par \par \uc2 (Jonathan Demme, 1991) Over-familiarity has lessened the degree to which the serial killer Dr Hannibal Lecter, as played by Anthony Hopkins, is able to be terrifying. But The Silence of the Lambs remains a way above average thriller, and Jodie Foster's performance as the tough-yet-vulnerable FBI agent Clarice Starling deserves to start taking more of the plaudits anyway. ****\par \par \uc2 Wednesday\par \par \uc2 The Deep Blue Sea\par \par \uc2 11.30PM FILM4\par \par \uc2 (Terence Davies, 2011) The mistake in adapting Terence Rattigan's 1952 play - about a dangerous eruption of passion in postwar austerity Britain; the doomed affair between a respectably married woman (Rachel Weisz) and a boyish RAF pilot (Tom Hiddleston) - would have been to deny its theatricality. But this is a lush and heady period melodrama, no less affecting for its artifice. ****\par \par \uc2 Thursday\par \par \uc2 Bullhead\par \par \uc2 10.50PM FILM4\par \par \uc2 (Micha\u235\'00\'EBl R. Roskam, 2011) Bullhead is a brooding, Oscar-nominated crime film set among the Belgian meat-farming community and amid the black-market trade in illegal growth hormones. It is about brutish men, the commodification of flesh, and how cruelty begets cruelty, and it has the unsentimental eye of a Dardenne brothers film. Matthias Schoenaerts is compelling as the hormone-addled and tortured hero. ****\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140308ea3800075\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 No 10 is forced into Cameron nanny checks\b0\par\par\uc2 By Andy McSmith   \par \uc2 176 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par \uc2 i\par \uc2 IIND\par \uc2 1ST\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd.

Ministers will spend the coming days fending off questions about their domestic employees - nannies, cleaners, builders, plumbers - specifi-cally about their nationality. David Cameron's spokesman stonewalled questions about his foreign nanny yesterday, and Nick Clegg admitted to employing a Belgian. Presumably there will be others, since the home roles most commonly contracted out are dominated, in London at least, by foreign workers. Imagine the sport if the questioning extends from nationality to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  status.

Truly a fascinating portrait of a genius, warts and all. And boy, there were plenty.

Her father has gone to South Africa to find work, and comes back only to die of Aids. Her 11-year-old friend is pregnant. This story is sometimes shocking, often heartbreaking \u8212\'20\'14 but also pulsing with colour and energy.

And suddenly, Darling really is in America, with her aunt Fostalina who lives in \u8220\'20\'1CDestroyedmichygen"; a run-down and snowy Detroit. Bulawayo conveys the culture shock brilliantly.

\par\par \uc2 Columnists\par \b \uc2 Panicked Tories are attacking their own voters; James Brokenshire blames the \u8216\'20\'18metropolitan elite\u8217\'20\'19 for fuelling \uc2 immigration\uc2 . He\u8217\'20\'19s either suffered a brainstorm or gone rogue\b0\par\par\uc2 Matthew Parris   \par \uc2 1,084 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par 00:01\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Does your shower leak through your kitchen ceiling? Then do the patriotic thing. Put a bucket under the leak and wait months for an expensive plumber with an English surname. Or so the Government seems to be urging.\par \par \uc2 Ye gods, panicking Tories are now turning their guns on their own voters. Apparently we are traitors for giving work to Eastern European jobseekers, suggests a Home Office minister this week. It\u8217\'20\'19s our fault.\par \par \uc2 Did somebody put the pitiable James Brokenshire up to this? On Wednesday the startled mole of a junior minister morphed into an demented ferret and went on a rampage against those he accuses of fuelling \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from Europe: \u8220\'20\'1Cthe wealthy metropolitan elite". As if millions of Eastern European \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  throng the halls and line the marbled stairs of the rich in London. I hadn\u8217\'20\'19t realised Downton Abbey was a documentary. Then he widened his attack to the use of \u8220\'20\'1Ccheap labour" generally.\par \par \uc2 Tipping a French waiter becomes a betrayal of our own countrymen. The railway refreshment trolley pushed by a Czech woman is a weapon of mass destruction trained on British workers. What next? A giant white builder\u8217\'20\'19s van packed like a Trojan horse with invading Poles? An army of Estonian chambermaids insinuating themselves into our seaside hotels ready to break cover and overwhelm us? The film industry should get on to this: When Nannies Attack; Revenge of the Cabbage Pickers.\par \par \uc2 Don\u8217\'20\'19t bother with the Brokenshire speech. I\u8217\'20\'19ve read it in full. It\u8217\'20\'19s half-witted, disjointed, clich\u233\'00\'E9-ridden nonsense. When I hear the phrase \u8220\'20\'1Cfor too long we have . . ." I begin to twitch. When it is suggested we do something because \u8220\'20\'1Cit\u8217\'20\'19s the right thing to do . . . " I grimace. When I encounter \u8220\'20\'1Clet\u8217\'20\'19s face it . . . " the pain grows. And when we hit \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m sorry, but . . . " I reach for my revolver. Are we listening to a government minister or minicab driver? \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m sorry but . . . " encapsulates the snarl masquerading as a whimper that forms the stock-in-trade of rancid populists, from Juan Per\u243\'00\'F3n to Nigel Farage.\par \par \uc2 To the extent that Mr Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s speech to the Demos think-tank contains an argument, the argument collapses. The minister tries to insist that the recent Labour Market Displacement Report does not contradict an earlier report (itself carefully worded) that had suggested \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  workers could cost native workers jobs. In fact, the LMD report concludes that there is \u8220\'20\'1Crelatively little evidence that migration has caused statistically significant displacement of UK natives from the labour market in periods when the economy is strong". At times of recession, it says, some displacement may occur; but as the economy recovers the effect disappears.\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s just common sense. When jobs are plentiful, \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  don\u8217\'20\'19t displace natives; when jobs are scarce, they may. For a period, cheap \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  labour may \u8220\'20\'1Cforce down" (as Mr Brokenshire put it) some wages. Since this Government has from the start, rightly, been forcing down wages \u8212\'20\'14 forcing down the remuneration of millions of its own often low-paid employees \u8212\'20\'14 this should come as good news to the Chancellor, whom I notice goes silent when these disputes break out.\par \par \uc2 In the name of all that\u8217\'20\'19s sane and civilised, what are the Tories doing whipping up resentment of European \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  when our growing economy needs them and there\u8217\'20\'19s no way anyway of keeping them out? No way, that is, except by choosing to quit the \uc2 European Union\uc2  after a referendum that \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  himself has conjured from nowhere and in which he would be recommending that we stay? Is Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s compass broken? Is there a wobbly needle somewhere in his brain, whizzing helplessly round and round, lost to magnetism and prey to every gust from the Tory right? The effort to resist that conclusion is becoming harder to sustain.\par \par \uc2 Yet still I try to resist it. Maybe (I tell myself) Mr Brokenshire was freelancing? Maybe he had gone rogue in that speech accusing a Lib Dem Cabinet minister (Vince Cable) of lying, and insulting both \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and those who give them work? Maybe Cabinet ministers didn\u8217\'20\'19t know he would claim that the authors of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  are our \u8220\'20\'1Cmetropolitan elite"?\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s possible. A speech on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  by a Minister of State would normally be cleared by seniors, but given that it would take the average journalist about seven seconds to unearth Tories with foreign home helps, you do have to wonder if Mr Brokenshire suffered a brainstorm? If so, why didn\u8217\'20\'19t the PM or the Home Secretary immediately disown these ravings? When ministers on the Tory left speak out of turn they feel the force of Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s displeasure within hours.\par \par \uc2 So maybe Mr Cameron actually believes this stuff? Or maybe he doesn\u8217\'20\'19t believe anything?\par \par \uc2 Or maybe (I tell myself) this was intended as nothing more than a sop to the irreconcilables on the Tory benches: a bit of dog-whistling to UKIP-inclined Conservative voters?\par \par \uc2 Clinging desperately to my faith in Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s rationality and liberalism, I plump for this last option: a sop. The thing about sops, though, is they have to satisfy. \b \uc2 Immigrant\b0 \uc2 -bashing from Tory ministers doesn\u8217\'20\'19t. Nobody is fooled; the irreconcilables smell fear in Downing Street and their contempt grows.\par \par \uc2 Here\u8217\'20\'19s an analogy fanciful enough to distance us from our own affiliations. Imagine that a small, single-issue party threatened a governing party by talking up popular concern about possible brain damage from mobile phones, promising in its manifesto to issue the entire population with lead-lined helmets. And suppose the governing party regarded that as impractical. Would you be recommending the governing party to talk up the possible dangers, sympathise with popular worries, rage against the threat of radiation, and make noisy speeches listing all the legislative tweaks they would make, marginally to reduce the electronic menace?\par \par \uc2 And would you have advised them, early on, to promise huge cuts in electronic radiation from phone use?\par \par \uc2 The Tories have no answer to European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . For Mr Cameron to demand serious curbs would fail, wreck negotiations and diminish chances of achieving the achievable. He know this. Voters do, too. It isn\u8217\'20\'19t ideal but the best the Tories can do now on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is put that one down to experience and shut up.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140308ea38000i8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 Camerons reveal how their nanny became British citizen\b0\par\par\uc2 Francis Elliott, Political Editor   \par \uc2 651 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par 00:01\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Samantha Cameron\uc2  was named on an application for British citizenship made by the family\u8217\'20\'19s Nepalese nanny that succeeded just a few months after the last election, No 10 said last night.\par \par \uc2 Downing Street released the information as it struggled to contain the fallout caused by a Home Office minister\u8217\'20\'19s claim that the \u8220\'20\'1Cwealthy, metropolitan elite" were fuelling migration.\par \par \uc2 James Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s accusation has thrown the spotlight on coalition ministers, such as \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and Nick Clegg, who employ foreign staff. In its efforts to fight off accusations of double standards No 10 revealed that the Camerons\u8217\'20\'19 nanny was now a British citizen.\par \par \uc2 That led to questions over how Gita Lima had secured a British passport and to calls from Labour for \u8220\'20\'1Ccomplete transparency and openness".\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere should not be any delay in providing this information so that people can be assured that he has acted appropriately," Phil Wilson, Labour MP for Sedgefield, said.\par \par \uc2 After initially refusing to answer queries over Ms Lima\u8217\'20\'19s application and what steps the Prime Minister took to ensure he did not exert undue influence over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  authorities, Downing Street released a statement.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMr and Mrs Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s nanny became a British citizen in late 2010. Mr and Mrs Cameron did not write a letter supporting their nanny\u8217\'20\'19s application for British citizenship. The normal application process was followed throughout. As is usual, Mrs Cameron was named on her application as her employer," it said.\par \par \uc2 Ms Lima was hired by the Camerons in the latter half of the last decade through a charity that helps \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  escape abusive bosses. Kalayaan is based in Holland Park, close the family\u8217\'20\'19s former home in Notting Hill.\par \par \uc2 The charity has been highly critical of a 2012 change in the visa rules that limits foreign domestic staff to working for a named employer and sets a six-month deadline on their residency. Ms Lima took a leave of absence in 2012 but has since returned to work to help the Camerons look after their three children.\par \par \uc2 The focus on the nanny, which comes at the end of a week of coalition rows over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , has infuriated senior Conservatives. Mr Brokenshire had been intending to draw a line between the Tory and Liberal Democrat positions on migration when he blamed middle-class employers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor too long, the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour, or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services, but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country," he said in a speech to the Demos think-tank on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether Mr Cameron and his wife had chosen their nanny on the basis of cost, a spokeswoman said: \u8220\'20\'1CI think they were guided by someone who would look after their children in the way they wanted to."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg said yesterday that he employs a Belgian as domestic help.\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s speech came after a Government analysis concluded there was \u8220\'20\'1Crelatively little evidence" that migrant workers had replaced Britons in jobs during the boom years.\par \par \uc2 The Tories have set a goal of reducing net migration to tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament, a target that looks set to be missed after the most recent figures surged year-on-year by more than a third to 212,000 in the 12 months to September 2013.\par \par \uc2 Ministers have repeatedly cited research by \uc2 the Migration Advisory Committee\uc2  published in 2012 and covering the period from 1995 to 2010 that found 23 British workers were left unemployed for every 100 new arrivals from outside the EU. The new analysis, however, stated that \u8220\'20\'1Cwhen data from part of the period of economic downturn (2009 and 2010) were omitted, the impact of non-EU migration was not found to be statistically significant".\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140308ea38000jd\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Outrage over plan to create easy entry visas for new migrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By Martyn Brown   \par \uc2 612 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par 00:22\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 A LIB DEM plan to open up Britain\u8217\'20\'19s borders to thousands more migrants was savaged last night.\par \par \uc2 The party has proposed a relaxation of rules to make it easier for foreigners and their families to come and live in the UK.\par \par \uc2 A \u8220\'20\'1Cgrandparents\u8217\'20\'19 super visa" to help migrants bring in elderly relatives is being considered, along with a cut in the amount an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  must earn before their spouse can join them.\par \par \uc2 Critics say that alone could mean thousands of extra people entering the UK and Nick Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s party was branded \u8220\'20\'1Cout of touch with\u160\'00\'A0ordinary people" by a Tory MP.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dem plans come amid growing Coalition tension over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and as current figures show net migration is up to 212,000. David Cameron wants to bring this number down to the \u8220\'20\'1Ctens of thousands" by next year.\par \par \uc2 A document prepared for the party\u8217\'20\'19s Spring conference in York this weekend states: \u8220\'20\'1CLiberal Democrats propose to ask \uc2 the Migration Advisory Committee\uc2  to reconsider the minimum income threshold for a spouse to come to the UK in light of the principle that a person with the means to support their family should be allowed to do so."\par \par \uc2 It adds that the party proposes \u8220\'20\'1Cthe introduction of a \u8216\'20\'18grandparents\u8217\'20\'19 super visa\u8217\'20\'19 that would allow grandparents to visit for a period of up to two years".\par \par \uc2 Critics blasted Mr Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s party for wanting to \u8220\'20\'1Cre-open the door" to \u8220\'20\'1Cuncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ".\par \par \uc2 Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke said: \u8220\'20\'1CThis once again shows the Lib Dems are out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSince 2010 the Conservatives have taken tough measures to reverse Labour\u8217\'20\'19s uncontrolled mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and take back control of our borders. Now the Lib Dems want to re-open the door to uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Tory MP Charlie Elphicke criticised the border plans proposed by the Lib Dems [GETTY]\par \par \uc2 Other plans for discussion in the policy document, Making Migration Work For Britain, suggest removing foreign students from any migration target.\par \par \uc2 This would, in effect increase the target for the number of migrants by over 150,000 people a year.\par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrats would also allow these students to remain after their studies, despite the challenges faced by recent graduates to find work.\par \par \uc2 Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s director of communications Patrick O\u8217\'20\'19Flynn said: \u8220\'20\'1CThere will have to be firm restrictions of the ability of migrants to bring in extended family members, especially when these people may be more advanced in years and they are liable to run up higher costs.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt seems as if the Liberal Democrats still want to turn the \uc2 NHS\uc2  into the World Health Service and the British welfare state into the world\u8217\'20\'19s welfare state.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHardworking people in Britain cannot afford this reckless and ill-considered approach to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 A Lib Dem spokesman said: \u8220\'20\'1CThese measures are basically about British people\u8217\'20\'19s family lives. The income threshold is set too high at \u163\'00\'A318,600 and we want that reviewed. It is not fair to say that it will lead to thousands more people coming." Details emerged days after a furious Coalition row over the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on jobs\par \par \uc2 Conservative Minister James Brokenshire accused Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable of being \u8220\'20\'1Ccondescending" after he said he was \u8220\'20\'1Cintensely relaxed" about large-scale migration to the UK.\par \par \uc2 The spat came as Government analysis concluded migrant workers had replaced Britons in jobs during the economic downturn.\par \par \uc2 At the last election the Lib Dem\u8217\'20\'19s radical policies included offering an amnesty to 600,000 illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  allowing them to remain in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140308ea3800105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

do you respond to globalisation by being open or closed?"\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg said he understood the appeal of Ukip to voters: " At a time of economic insecurity, in the wake of this massive cardiac arrest we suffered back in 2008, because of all of the anxieties associated with globalisation where people feel their lives are being affected by forces which they can't control, I think it is totally logical actually that some people will find it quite seductive when a politician says, 'it's someone else's fault and all your anxieties can be lifted from your shoulders if only we just shut the door'."\par \par \uc2 In contrast to David Cameron, he added: "I've never dismissed Ukip as nutters and fruitcakes.\par \par \uc2 "I take what they represent deadly seriously and, by the way, I wouldn't be having a debate with Nigel Farage unless I took what he says very, very seriously."\par \par \uc2 But he said Mr Farage "wants to turn the clock back, he doesn't like modern Britain, he wants to dismiss so many of the big modern features of modern life - I want to embrace them".\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg will make an appearance on the conference platform later today, answering questions from activists.\par \par \uc2 Before that Mr Alexander will set out how the party would further increase the income tax threshold to \u163\'00\'A312,500 in the next parliament.\par \par \uc2 Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander will confirm that increasing the threshold will be written into the party's manifesto for the contest, and a rise of at least \u163\'00\'A3500 - giving a tax cut of \u163\'00\'A3100 - would be earmarked for the first Budget or Autumn Statement after the election.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems have made raising the point at which people start paying income tax to \u163\'00\'A310,000 a priority in Government, with Mr Clegg pressing for a further \u163\'00\'A3500 rise to give a "workers' bonus" in this months' Budget.\par \par \uc2 Activists are also set to consider a new set of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policies - replacing the Lib Dems' former commitment to an amnesty and the potential for regional quotas.\par \par \uc2 Instead the conference will be asked to back a push for European migrants coming to the UK being forced to wait six months before gaining access to the benefits system as part of a Europe-wide reform.\par \par \uc2 But the changes proposed by the Lib Dems would also make it easier for \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to bring members of their family to join them in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Business Secretary Vince Cable, who has repeatedly clashed with coalition colleagues over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , is expected to request to take part in the debate along with rank and file party members.\par \par \uc2 Coalition welfare policies will also come under scrutiny as the Lib Dems debate a motion calling for an urgent independent review into the relationship between benefit mistakes or penalties and the growth of food poverty.\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140308ea38000mb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 LET PRESS FIGHT CORRUPT COPSTwenty-one years on, not a single police officer has been held to account over the Met's shameful handling of Stephen Lawrence's murder.We now know that small sections of an otherwise decent police force were not only\u160\'00\'A0 racist but also corrupt, choosing to protect each others' backs rather than fight for the victims of crime. When the police and the justice system failed, it was the Daily Mail, with its courageous campaign, which took up the fight for Stephen and his family.Yet under Lord Leveson's proposals for reform of the Press, the police whistleblowers whose information was so vital to the Mail's campaign would be banned from talking to journalists.No police force will ever be free of corrupt cops, but unless we have every means\u160\'00\'A0 at our disposal to expose them \u8212\'20\'14 including, vitally, an unfettered press \u8212\'20\'14 nothing will change. \u160\'00\'A0--Research shows that if you lose your temper you risk a heart attack even two hours after calming down.\par \par \uc2  Gordon Ramsay (right) must have an ambulance permanently parked outside all\u160\'00\'A0 his restaurants.--From the moment Prince William became engaged to \uc2 Kate Middleton\uc2 , he did everything he could to ensure they would have as normal a life as possible. And who can blame him?After living his childhood years forever in the public eye, and suffering the death of his mother, he was determined to do things differently when it came to his own family.When they were first married, William and Kate demanded \u8212\'20\'14 and were given \u8212\'20\'14 privacy and the right to live, as far as possible, like any other young couple.We admired the way they made their home a modest farmhouse in Anglesey. And how, while he was out working as an RAF helicopter pilot, she would be seen at the local supermarket alongside other housewives.It seemed so normal, and such a refreshing change from the self-indulgent grandeur of Prince Charles with his 150 flunkeys.They started off saying there was to be no nanny, for example, as they would be hands-on (they are now employing one full-time).Which makes it all the more disappointing that this apparently 'ordinary' young couple have decided to jet off to the Maldives on a second honeymoon, leaving behind baby George just eight months after his birth.For this is no ordinary holiday. Kate and William flew first class \u8212\'20\'14 with around six taxpayer-funded protection officers \u8212\'20\'14 to the Maldivian capital Mal\u233\'00\'E9, and went straight to the airport's VIP suite before taking a private hydroplane to five-star luxury at the Cheval Blanc Randheli hotel on the atoll of Noonu.I understand the couple will also spend a romantic night away from George during their New Zealand tour. They'll stay at a fabulously luxurious lakeside lodge, leaving the infant Prince with their travelling nanny. How grand can a couple who say they love the simple life get? And how can any new mother swan off for some 'me time' on a five-star sunlounger, leaving her baby behind? It's not as if Kate, who has never had a proper job, is deprived of holidays. Her tan can hardly have faded since returning from Mustique last month. As for William, who also doesn't now have a proper job, he's breaking off from his ten-week agriculture course at Cambridge University which goes on until the end of the month!Couldn't the couple have waited for some sun until their Australian tour next month?My concern is that the grounded couple we came to admire in Anglesey are all-too swiftly becoming a pair of high-handed, high-living royals in the Prince Charles mode.Swanning off at a whim on holidays partly funded by taxpayers, whose disposable income seems to shrink every month, is not the best way of enhancing their image. At this rate Kate and William could end up demonstrating not the hard-working qualities of the Queen and Prince Philip, but the worst excesses of Princess Margaret and Prince Andrew.--Women have six-and-a-half hours free time each day, says a new report. It was clearly written by men \u8212\'20\'14 only they could consider hoovering, cooking, ironing and tidying up after them to be leisure activities.--* With a personal\u160\'00\'A0 fortune of tens of millions, mostly gained through exploiting his experience as a war monger \u8212\'20\'14 sorry, peace broker \u8212\'20\'14 Tony Blair will be giving a large donation to the near-bankrupted Labour Party.What a shame he isn't giving some of his ill-gotten gains to Dr David Kelly's family or to help the families of the men who died in his wars or who lost limbs, not to mention the\u160\'00\'A0 victims of those IRA murderers given Get Out Of Jail Free cards by this cynical, amoral, greedy man.\u160\'00\'A0 \u160\'00\'A0* A new poll says people describe Nick Clegg as a 'spineless liar', David Cameron as 'posh and out of touch' and Ed Miliband as a 'weak idiot'. At best, say voters, Red Ed's\u160\'00\'A0 'trying'. Yes, very\u160\'00\'A0 trying indeed.\u160\'00\'A0* Attacking failing teachers, Vince Cable says they let pupils down as they know 'absolutely nothing about the world of work'. A bit rich coming from a man whose own boss, Nick Clegg, has never had a job outside politics.\u160\'00\'A0* Criticism of Speaker Bercow's 12-day, \u163\'00\'A341,884 jolly to Burma and New Zealand is unfair. Have some pity on the poor soul. How else can he escape his harridan of a wife Sally?--* As Ukraine trembled on the precipice of civil war, our PM posted a selfie of himself on the phone in Number 10 gazing resolutely into the distance. He tweeted: 'I've been speaking to @BarackObama\u160\'00\'A0 about the situation in Ukraine.' Silly sod, he looked like he was ordering a pizza. \u160\'00\'A0* As some back Ukraine's desire\u160\'00\'A0 to turn west and join the EU, has anyone spared a thought as to how we will absorb the \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from its 45 million population? By the way, what is 'skinny latte to go' in Ukrainian?\u160\'00\'A0* How dare critics say Britain\u160\'00\'A0 has done nothing to punish the Russians over their invasion of\u160\'00\'A0 Crimea \u8212\'20\'14 we cancelled Prince Edward's visit to the Sochi Paralympic Games. That'll teach the dastardly Putin! --As flood victims returned to their destroyed homes and livelihoods, trust-me-Dave's promise that money was no object to help them must have rung very hollow indeed. Especially when they learnt we are giving \u163\'00\'A31?billion in aid to 'victims' in Ukraine. Meanwhile, 500 people have formed a volunteer army to help with the clear-up, ripping out carpets and emptying freezers full of rotting food in the homes of strangers. There are still many decent people in this country.--PRUNELLA'S PLIGHTTimothy West's tender account of his wife Prunella Scales's 'mild Alzheimer's' was not just loving, it was also informative. This disease can be a rapid descent into despair, not only for sufferers but their families, too. The person they loved is gone and replaced with the shell of a human being who cannot even remember their name. Some people with the disease suffer mood swings or depression and even become violent.But for others, like Prunella Scales, it is a more gentle slope into forgetfulness. This is what it has been like for\u160\'00\'A0 my mum, who also has Alzheimer's. So what if Mum repeats herself or asks for a gin and tonic despite being teetotal. She is still there, and we love her all the same. She can make us laugh and reminisce just as we always have done with her.By talking about Alzheimer's so honestly, Timothy West showed us that the disease, though often devastating, is not always so terrible.--GIVE YOUR DOSH, POSHJ.K. Rowling, Jemima Khan and Victoria Beckham (left) have launched a campaign to put pressure on the \uc2 British government\uc2  to help sexually abused children in Syria and in other war zones. A worthy cause indeed, but couldn't these three women, among the wealthiest in the country, just put their hands in their Louis Vuitton purses?--The live televising of the Oscar Pistorius murder trial was justified on the grounds that it offered transparency and openness during a deeply controversial court case.When we saw the accused in court this week sobbing with his head in his hands, grasping his rosary beads as he heard a witness describe his girlfriend's dying moments \u8212\'20\'14 and how Pistorius had prayed to God for her to live \u8212\'20\'14 it didn't look like transparency, but stage-managed manipulation straight\u160\'00\'A0 out of the O.J. Simpson handbook.--Lawmakers are considering making non-violent 'psychological abuse' within a relationship a criminal offence punishable by law. Such 'abuse' would include a spouse telling you they didn't like what you were wearing. Given my own history of fashion disasters, half my ex-boyfriends would be in Belmarsh right now.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140307ea380000y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 LET MIGRANTS' GRANDPARENTS INTO UK TOO, SAY LIB DEMS\b0\par\par\uc2 BY GERRI PEEV    \par \uc2 544 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \b \uc2 IMMIGRANTS\b0 \uc2  should be allowed to move their extended families to the UK more easily, the Liberal Democrats will say.\par \par \uc2 They are to propose that rules should be changed so that it is less difficult for the spouses and elderly grandparents of migrants to move to Britain.\par \par \uc2 The plan to water down \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rules will be unveiled at the Lib Dems' current spring conference in York.\par \par \uc2 Activists have criticised the Government's recent decision to raise the earning threshold from \u163\'00\'A318,600 to \u163\'00\'A322,400 before a migrant can bring their husband or wife to the UK, saying nearly half the population would not meet this criteria. Other proposals include allowing ageing relatives to join their migrant children in the UK for up to two years through a new grandparent 'super visa'.\par \par \uc2 The party says the policy could benefit wealthier \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , who would pay a health levy before their parents could join them to cover the increased health and social costs to Britain.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems' policy paper on migration says: 'Our current system does not allow foreign grandparents to visit their families for an extended period. Countries such as Canada have introduced an extended tourist visa for these circumstances.\par \par \uc2 'Allowing elderly relatives who can be adequately supported to visit enables them to spend time with their families, and makes Britain a more attractive place to settle for those highly skilled and wealthy migrants who benefit our economy.'\par \par \uc2 Asylum seekers who have been in Britain for more than six months would be given the right to work, it adds.\par \par \uc2 Foreign students who graduate in science, maths, engineering or technology would also be allowed to stay and work for three years after completing their course. The suggestion will spark fears that more migrants would compete with British graduates already struggling to find jobs in a tight market.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems' plans fly in the face of public concern over escalating levels of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , which jumped by 60,000 to 220,000 last year.\par \par \uc2 Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke said: 'This once again shows the Lib Dems are out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people across the country. Since 2010 the Conservatives have taken tough measures to reverse Labour's decade of uncontrolled mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and take back control of our borders.\par \par \uc2 'Now the Lib Dems want to re-open the door to uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .'\par \par \uc2 Lib Dems, led by MP Sir Andrew Stunell, will also discuss removing foreign students from overall \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  targets. However, the party also wants all migrants to learn English, and for exit controls to be introduced at borders to monitor the numbers leaving the UK.\par \par \uc2 In its policy motion, Sir Andrew writes: 'For generations, migrants have enriched Britain's culture, language and society and brought innovation, economic growth and increased prosperity for the whole country.'\par \par \uc2 Issan Ghazni, chairman of the Ethnic Minority Liberal Democrats, recently urged his party to woo the voters of EU migrants ahead of the European elections. EU citizens can vote in the UK in the European and local elections.\par \par \uc2 ??Lib Dems will fight for the income tax threshold to be raised by a further \u163\'00\'A3250 to \u163\'00\'A312,500, Danny Alexander will announce tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140307ea380001f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 RED FACES IN CABINET AFTER MINISTER SLAMS 'WEALTHY ELITE' FOR CHEAP LABOUR\b0\par\par\uc2 BY TIM SHIPMAN DEPUTY    \par \uc2 470 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 24\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 THE Tories faced fresh embarrassment over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  last night when it emerged that Home Secretary Theresa May uses a Brazilian-born cleaner.\par \par \uc2 A day after \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister James Brokenshire condemned the 'wealthy metropolitan elite' for using cheap labour from migrants, his boss confirmed that she employs a female home help who was born abroad.\par \par \uc2 The cleaner has obtained British citizenship and aides denied that Mrs May played any role in assisting her quest for a passport.\par \par \uc2 But the revelation came as Downing Street admitted that \uc2 Samantha Cameron\uc2  helped the Prime Minister's Nepalese nanny get British citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Cameron signed Gita Lima's application for British citizenship in 2010 as the Nepalese nanny's employer. In that role she would have been expected to support her claim for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 A No10 spokesman said: 'Mr and Mrs Cameron's nanny became a British citizen in late 2010. Mr and Mrs Cameron did not write a letter supporting their nanny's application for British citizenship. The normal application process was followed throughout.'\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Mrs May said: 'Theresa May's cleaner is a British citizen but she was born in Brazil. Theresa had no role at all in her cleaner's application for citizenship.'\par \par \uc2 But the fresh revelations will fuel the view of many voters that Cabinet ministers are part of the 'wealthy metropolitan elite' criticised by Mr Brokenshire.\par \par \uc2 And the details are likely to spark cries of hypocrisy among those who employ cleaners and nannies at the way ministers are prepared to criticise people who hire \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  workers while doing exactly the same themselves.\par \par \uc2 In a speech on Thursday, Mr Brokenshire said: 'For too long, the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour, or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services, but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country.' The issue is particularly acute since Mr Brokenshire's predecessor Mark Harper was forced to resign after it emerged that he had employed a cleaner who was working in Britain illegally.\par \par \uc2 A Downing Street spokesman made clear that the Camerons employed Miss Lima not because she was cheap but because she was the best person for the job.\par \par \uc2 The candour of Mrs May and the Camerons was not matched by all in the Cabinet. The Daily Mail yesterday asked 20 of its members if they employed foreign workers as cleaners, nannies, builders and home helps.\par \par \uc2 However, the majority of those questioned failed to provide a substantive response.\par \par \uc2 Labour MP John Mann said they should come clean, adding: 'They should be seeking out British staff. We need every Cabinet minister to declare what staff they have employed from abroad.'\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140307ea3800024\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Lib Dems advocate return to open-door \uc2 immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 428 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par 01:20\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 IT REALLY does appear that the Liberal Democrats have a death wish. That is the only conclusion that can be drawn from their recently revealed plans for \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yesterday it came out that Nick Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s party is in favour of a \u8220\'20\'1Csuper grandparents visa" that would make it easier for \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to bring their elderly relatives with them. That would open the door to an influx of older \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who would be desperate to claim \uc2 NHS\uc2  treatment and assorted benefits.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems also suggested removing foreign students from the Government\u8217\'20\'19s official migration statistics. This would allow \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to flood into Britain using university studies as a flimsy pretext.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore they also said they would even allow the students to stay in Britain after completing their studies despite graduate employment remaining a problem for many young people who would face an even tougher fight to get their first full-time job.\par \par \uc2 Clegg and his party already have absolutely no understanding of the problems being caused for British people by the lax \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy forced upon us by EU membership.\par \par \uc2 Now they want to make the situation even worse.\par \par \uc2 New focus on Alzheimer\u8217\'20\'19s\par \par \uc2 With 800,000 people in the UK estimated to be suffering from dementia it is high time for a revolution in the way the disease is treated.\par \par \uc2 Angela Rippon\u8217\'20\'19s bid to make Alzheimer\u8217\'20\'19s a \u8220\'20\'1Clong-term treatable illness" is a noble cause.\par \par \uc2 The outpouring of sadness and support for Timothy West following his searingly honest account of the dementia suffered by his wife Prunella Scales showed last week how important it is to be honest and open about Alzheimer\u8217\'20\'19s.\par \par \uc2 Author Sir Terry Pratchett has waged his battle with dementia in the public eye raising awareness of the disease and proving that a diagnosis does not mean that all is lost either for the sufferer or their family.\par \par \uc2 Angela\u8217\'20\'19s own mother died from Alzheimer\u8217\'20\'19s and she has been a selfless ambassador for the \uc2 Alzheimer\u8217\'20\'19s Society\uc2  since 2009. She and other campaigners around the country can and will make a real difference for dementia sufferers.\par \par \uc2 For all their hard work we are truly grateful.\par \par \uc2 And finally it is spring\par \par \uc2 At times it seemed as if the awful weather would never end. That makes the warm-weather forecast for the next month all the more exciting with temperatures expected to hit 19C tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 We wish all our readers a very pleasant weekend in the sunshine. It\u8217\'20\'19s been a long time coming.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140308ea380018i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

I understand that both airlines fly out of the North Terminal at Gatwick and I have 90 minutes between flights. Is that enough time to make the connection? Can I check my golf clubs all the way through to Edinburgh, or do I have to claim them from BA at LGW and recheck them with \uc2 easyJet\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 J Heise\par \par \uc2 Nick Trend, consumer expert\par \par \uc2 A I think you are cutting it extremely fine, even though both airlines do indeed use the same terminal. Because you are flying on two airlines, with two separate bookings, neither airline has a responsibility to make sure you connect, and you won't be able to check in yourself or your luggage on a "through journey". So when you arrive at Gatwick, you will have to pass through \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , collect your luggage, go out into the main terminal, check it in with \uc2 easyJet\uc2  and pass through security into the departures area. \uc2 EasyJet\uc2  closes check\u8211\'20\'13in 40 minutes before the scheduled departure time \u8211\'20\'13 and it is strict on this timing; in fact it recommends checking in two hours in advance. You are then supposed to be at the departure gate at least 30 minutes before departure.\par \par \uc2 You might be lucky, land early or on time, and hit a quiet moment at \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , but it will be tight. If you miss your flight, you will have to pay for a later one. Since BA also flies from Gatwick to Edinburgh, you would have been better off booking a through\u8211\'20\'13ticket on the same airline.\par \par \uc2 You can find advice and detailed information from all our experts online at telegraph.co.uk/ travelexperts and guides to major destinations at telegraph.co.uk/destinations.

A few days later Nick Clegg went further and unveiled the negotiating team \u8211\'20\'13 to be led by his chief sidekick Danny Alexander \u8211\'20\'13 already lined up to thrash out a second coalition agreement with either of the main parties after the votes are counted. And in private many Tory MPs are resigned to the prospect of not winning an overall majority in next year\u8217\'20\'19s poll.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Ukip vote could cost us up to 70 seats. We\u8217\'20\'19re not going to make it," one Tory gloom-monger told me.\par \par \uc2 Thirteen months away from the scheduled date for the next election, the political elite is already consumed with wrangling over how to share out the spoils. Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s audacious move, particularly given the Lib Dems\u8217\'20\'19 miserable opinion poll ratings, provoked surprise and irritation among senior Tories.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Lib Dems are utterly shameless. They seem to think they\u8217\'20\'19re already entitled to be part of another coalition. They are taking the voters for granted," one source said.\par \par \uc2 Among pundits the popular theory is that the declining popularity of the traditional Westminster parties means the days of landslide victories for a single party are gone. In 1951 Labour and the Tories shared 96 per cent of the votes cast between them. At the last election in 2010 that figure had slumped to 65 per cent. And the astonishing rise of the UK Independence Party threatens to eat away further at the fast-declining core votes of old mainstream parties.\par \par \uc2 Senior Tories suspect that while the popularity of the Lib Dems plunges, Mr Clegg is dreaming of keeping a top job in government in perpetuity. They point to the career of Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a German politician who managed to remain his country\u8217\'20\'19s foreign secretary from 1969 to 1992 simply because his tiny, centrist Free Democrat Party held the balance of power in a series of elections and could always cut a deal with one of the larger parties.\par \par \uc2 For many voters the thought of Mr Clegg remaining Deputy Prime Minister for more than two decades is beyond a nightmare. But perhaps it does not need to be like that \u8211\'20\'13 received wisdom among the Westminster elite about what is inevitable for the country can be confounded once the voters are given a say.\par \par \uc2 While the coalition government is Britain\u8217\'20\'19s first since the Second World War the electoral system has thrown up hung parliaments and minority administrations. The result was that voters were sickened by the wrangling and squabbling and were soon yearning for the smack of firm government. Economic crisis in the 1970s brought a series of inconclusive election results, minority rule and at one stage an ill-fated Lib-Lab pact.\par \par \uc2 Voters turned to Margaret Thatcher partly out of disgust with the feeble politics of compromise that had gone before, as well as out of frustration with economic failure. In the early 1990s John Major was forced into seeking a deal with the Ulster Unionists when his narrow Tory majority dribbled away. The chaos and backroom deals of that period contributed to the disillusionment with the Conservatives that brought landslide victories for Tony Blair.\par \par \uc2 Opinion polls suggest that voters today, having accepted that coalition did bring some political stability after the financial crash, are losing patience with the paralysis and petty squabbling into which the current two-party administration has fallen. This week\u8217\'20\'19s public spat over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy was typical of the posturing that frustrates voters. Lib Dem business secretary Vince Cable goaded the Tories by talking up the benefit of mass migration and railing against \u8220\'20\'1Cscare stories".\par \par \uc2 Tory \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister James Brokenshire hit back by denouncing his analysis as \u8220\'20\'1Cincorrect" and blaming a \u8220\'20\'1Cwealthy metropolitan elite" for driving the influx of migrants. Outside Westminster what the voters see is net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  figures soaring while coalition ministers bicker.\par \par \uc2 At the next election they will deliver their verdict on coalition and as in the past appear to be itching for strong, one-party government once again. David Cameron has just over a year to convince the electorate that the Tories can provide that sort of leadership.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe need to lose the pessimism and toughen up," one senior Tory source said.\par \par \uc2 The pressure is on the Prime Minister and his team to confound the Westminster village pundits and save Britain from another Rose Garden deal.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140308ea38001b9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw119\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1785\pichgoal600

That is the only conclusion that can be drawn from their recently revealed plans for \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yesterday it came out that Nick Clegg's party is in favour of a "super grandparents visa" that would make it easier for \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to bring their elderly relatives with them. That would open the door to an influx of older \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who would be desperate to claim \uc2 NHS\uc2  treatment and assorted benefits.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems also suggested removing foreign students from the Government's official migration statistics. This would allow \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to flood into Britain using university studies as a flimsy pretext.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore they also said they would even allow the students to stay in Britain after completing their studies despite graduate employment remaining a problem for many young people who would face an even tougher fight to get their first full\u8211\'20\'13time job.\par \par \uc2 Clegg and his party already have absolutely no understanding of the problems being caused for British people by the lax \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy forced upon us by EU membership. Now they want to make the situation even worse.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140308ea3800027\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw59\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal885\pichgoal600

The Association of Chartered Accountants last month announced a record number of students had completed their final courses. Almost 8,000 students around the world completed all the exams needed to enter the profession.\par \par \uc2 Document SC00000020140308ea380000k\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Theresa May admits to having a Brazilian cleaner as \uc2 immigration\uc2  row continues\b0\par\par\uc2 By Owen Bennett -

provided that they pay their taxes and pay their way".\par \par \uc2 Asked if he agreed, Mr Alexander said: "'Intensely relaxed' was an expression coined by Peter Mandelson to show that he was not necessarily in line with some traditional views that were held within his government.\par \par \uc2 "What Vince was saying is that we have never been signed up to a target of getting \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  down to the tens of thousands, but we are signed up to making sure that our \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system is administered effectively."\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140308ea38002e7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 PA News Feeds\par \b \uc2 Cable slams Tory \uc2 immigration\uc2  policy\b0\par\par\uc2 1,079 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par 11:30\par \uc2 London Evening Standard Online\par \uc2 NSONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited.   \par \par \uc2 Vince Cable has stepped up his row with the Tories over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , accusing his coalition colleagues of tending to "fan the flames of prejudice" over the issue.\par \par \uc2 The Business Secretary's comments on the "toxic" subject came as he threw his weight behind Liberal Democrat calls for changes to make it easier for foreign students to stay and work in the UK, and for \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to bring their families to live with them.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cable's latest intervention comes just days after he was attacked by \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister James Brokenshire over the Lib Dem minister's belief that the rise in \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was "good news" for the country.\par \par \uc2 The Business Secretary said the Lib Dem proposals would help "persuade the public to calm down" about fears of the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Speaking at the Lib Dem spring conference in York, Mr Cable said: "It was never more necessary to have a party that was willing to stand up on this toxic issue and address it from the point of view of realism and evidence and fact.\par \par \uc2 "The Labour Party will always hide in a bunker when difficult issues like this come along and the Tories tend to fan the flames of prejudice and then they panic when it gets out of control and parties even further to the right take over.\par \par \uc2 "We have an acute responsibility here."\par \par \uc2 He said Liberals had stood up for the rights of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , be they Jews from eastern Europe in the early 20th century, East African Asians and citizens from Hong Kong.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cable said: "We have got the same challenge today and we have got to meet it. One of the ways of meeting it is to be realistic and address people's genuine concerns."\par \par \uc2 The Business Secretary backed proposals to allow science, engineering and maths students from outside the \uc2 European Union\uc2  (EU) to work in the UK for up to three years after graduating.\par \par \uc2 The plans would also allow \uc2 the Migration Advisory Committee\uc2  to make it easier for people to bring a spouse to join them in the UK.\par \par \uc2 The proposals would also allow elderly relatives to join their families in the UK as long as they paid a levy to cover their likely health costs.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cable said it was a "balanced platform, it gives us a platform of credibility with which we can then persuade the public to calm down, accept that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - properly managed - is good for our country and it is right that we accept the obligations that go with European membership too".\par \par \uc2 But there was some criticism of the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  proposals at the conference, with Northamptonshire councillor Jill Hope warning that the levy on health costs for elderly relatives would amount to "hundreds of thousands of pounds".\par \par \uc2 "It's a throwaway line and it's completely unworkable," she told the conference.\par \par \uc2 The Business Secretary's comments came at a conference which has been dominated so far by the issue of the UK's links with Brussels.\par \par \uc2 Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Tories had nothing meaningful to say on the issue as he sought to portray May's European elections as a straight choice between his Liberal Democrats and Ukip.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg has gambled that casting the Lib Dems as the "party of in" will appeal to voters concerned about severing ties with the EU.\par \par \uc2 Taking a swipe at both his Tory coalition colleagues and Labour over the EU, Mr Clegg said: " The two main parties in this country no longer have anything meaningful to say about Europe.\par \par \uc2 "Labour seems to be enjoying sitting on its hands and in a rather cowardly manner failing to make the internationalist case at all.\par \par \uc2 "The Conservatives are deeply divided between a significant part that agrees with Ukip, and another part casting around for ideas to keep them in the EU, so Labour and the Conservatives are split or confused, or completely lost the courage of their convictions.\par \par \uc2 "When big parties create vacuums like that they get filled, and they are being filled by the two other parties.\par \par \uc2 "Whether you agree with us or not, at least we have the merit of having clear and consistent views on this."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg will take on Ukip leader Nigel Farage in two head-to-head debates ahead of the European elections as part of the Lib Dem effort to set them up as the natural opponents to the party which has pushed them into fourth place in a series of opinion polls.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with The Guardian, he said: " The irony is that you have got the two smaller parties telling the country what the choice is, and the choice increasingly is whether we remain in or not.\par \par \uc2 "It is the same choice in Dutch, French and German politics - do you respond to globalisation by being open or closed?"\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg said he understood the appeal of Ukip to voters: " At a time of economic insecurity, in the wake of this massive cardiac arrest we suffered back in 2008, because of all of the anxieties associated with globalisation where people feel their lives are being affected by forces which they can't control, I think it is totally logical actually that some people will find it quite seductive when a politician says, 'it's someone else's fault and all your anxieties can be lifted from your shoulders if only we just shut the door'."\par \par \uc2 In contrast to David Cameron, he added: "I've never dismissed Ukip as nutters and fruitcakes.\par \par \uc2 "I take what they represent deadly seriously and, by the way, I wouldn't be having a debate with Nigel Farage unless I took what he says very, very seriously."\par \par \uc2 But he said Mr Farage "wants to turn the clock back, he doesn't like modern Britain, he wants to dismiss so many of the big modern features of modern life - I want to embrace them".\par \par \uc2 The \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  proposals, passed overwhelmingly by the conference, replace previous Lib Dem policies on the issue, including the controversial amnesty and regional system.\par \par \uc2 Under the new policy, the Lib Dems would back extending to six months the period before EU migrants could claim UK benefits, as part of Europe-wide reforms.\par \par \uc2 The plan would also require asylum seekers to try to find work after six months.\par \par \uc2 Former minister Sir Andrew Stunell, who helped draw up the plans, said they would "help Nick see off Nigel Farage".\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140308ea38001rx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

Some reports have claimed that it shows a negligible effect, but Mr Brokenshire insisted that it confirmed instead that British jobs were affected, particularly in poorer economic conditions. Figures from the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  showed last week that net migration has risen to 212,000 a year, more than double the Government\u8217\'20\'19s target.\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140308ea38001xh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

However, we know from Chechnya how brutally Putin can deal with dissatisfied minorities. The west would be criminally negligent if we allowed Crimea to become Russian without rock-solid safeguards for the region's Tatars and Ukrainians.\par \par \uc2 John Bond\par \par \uc2 Oxford\par \par \uc2 * Your report (Minister's speech turns spotlight on nationality of PM's staff, 7 March) could also have pointed out that Cameron employs an Aussie \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  as his puppet master. Then there is the Canadian \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  running the Bank of England and the New Zealand \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  in charge of RBS. Away from politics, we have in the Premier League perhaps Arsenal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  against Chelsea \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . Let's use the word in all cases where it applies and we might understand it a bit better.\par \par \uc2 David Wotherspoon\par \par \uc2 Downholland, Lancashire\par \par \uc2 * How is it that any one with an iPad or smartphone can track hundreds of thousands of ships throughout the world using a free "app", and the Justice ministry can't follow 20,000 offenders (Report, 6 March)?\par \par \uc2 Richard Bull\par \par \uc2 Woodbridge, Suffolk\par \par \uc2 1/15 Razmig Keucheyan makes some good points (Comment, 7 March) about capitalism's response to ecological crises, but for the social consequences you can't do better than Margaret Atwood in her Oryx and Crake trilogy. It's also a hugely enjoyable read.\par \par \uc2 Norman Housley\par \par \uc2 Leicester\par \par \uc2 * Carol Ann Duffy's poem Mrs Schofield's GCSE (G2, 4 April) brought to mind what is surely a still more telling response to the mismatch between poetry and the requirements of an exam, FH Townsend's parody of Wordsworth: O cuckoo, shall I call thee bird/ Or but a wandering voice?/ State the alternative preferred/ With reasons for your choice\par \par \uc2 Peter Burden\par \par \uc2 Coventry\par \par \uc2 * I never knew Mike Parker (Letters, 7 March) but he sounded like a decent type.\par \par \uc2 Michael Cunningham\par \par \uc2 Wolverhampton\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140308ea38000gk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Others\par \b \uc2 Sporting heroes: Woolf tipped balance in players\u8217\'20\'19 favour\b0\par\par\uc2 Asher Simons   \par \uc2 323 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par 14:08\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Before IMG, WMG and Octogon, there was Bob Woolf, the world\u8217\'20\'19s first sports agent. Woolf, born in 1928 in Portland, Maine to Jewish \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , won a basketball scholarship to Boston College and went on to get a law degree from \uc2 Boston University\uc2 . He later started his own law practice, Bob Woolf Associates.\par \par \uc2 The year was 1964 when \uc2 Boston Red Sox\uc2  pitcher, Earl Wilson first asked the local attorney to assist him with off field matters. Wilson then made a request to the Sox for Woolf to be present during his contract renewal negotiations to provide assistance. This was unprecedented and as such, a startled management refused. This refusal resulted in Wilson leaving the room multiple times during the negotiations to call Woolf for immediate advice.\par \par \uc2 Woolf began to represent more clients as athletes began to see the value in having professional negotiators involved in commercial and playing aspects of their career. An avid fan, Woolf had an office in the John Hancock building overlooking the \uc2 Red Sox\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 Fenway Park, with a telescope aimed at the diamond. He represented many of Boston\u8217\'20\'19s sporting heroes over the years including Carl Yastrzemski, Larry Bird and Doug Flutie. At the time of his death, in December 1993, Woolf represented over 150 athletes and entertainment professionals with offices in New York, Hollywood, Boston, LA, Dallas, and even Madrid.\par \par \uc2 What remains to this day is Woolf\u8217\'20\'19s reputation. He is seen as somebody who genuinely cared about his clients, advising them on everything financially, legally and even personally. The great Larry Bird once described Woolf as like a father. \u8220\'20\'1CHe told me what was going to happen and it always happened that way, so I always felt prepared", Bird once wrote.\par \par \uc2 Woolf passed away whilst watching NFL\u8217\'20\'19s Monday Night Football at his home. A fitting end to a man who changed the sports landscape forever.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140308ea380043d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Nick Clegg attacks Conservatives over \uc2 immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kiran Stacey, Political Correspondent   \par \uc2 452 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par 20:00\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg has launched an attack on the Conservative \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister over his recent warnings about the dangers of mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , as the Liberal Democrat leader looked to rally his party's supporters with an unashamedly pro-European pitch.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at the Liberal Democrat spring conference in York, the Lib Dem leader told party members he believed James Brokenshire's speech accusing the middle classes of exploiting cheap foreign labour, was "irresponsible".\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg added: "Over the last 24 to 48 hours we have seen, in many respects, some of the most ugly sides of the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate. It is truly dispiriting to see the Conservative and Labour parties, the two largest parties in British politics, driven, as far as I can see, entirely by panic on this issue."\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire gave a widely-criticised speech last week, in which he said: "For too long, the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour, or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services - but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg's attack on Mr Brokenshire echoed comments made earlier by Vince Cable, the Lib Dem business secretary, who accused the Tories of tending to "the flames of prejudice" over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The remarks form part of an attempt by the Lib Dems to make a virtue of their pro-EU and pro-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  stance, billing themselves the "party of in". With some polls suggesting the party may lose all of its MEPs at May's European elections, Lib Dem strategists have decided to take the risky tactic of advocating policies usually thought to be widely unpopular among British voters.\par \par \uc2 During a question-and-answer session with delegates in York, Mr Clegg was confronted with criticism from his own campaigners for the strategy. One local Lib Dem activist told the party leader that "on the doorstep, no one cares about this".\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile Mr Clegg also defended his party's policy of raising the salary at which people start having to pay income tax to \u163\'00\'A312,500, something Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary, earlier hinted could be a red line in any 2015 coalition negotiations.\par \par \uc2 The Institute of Fiscal Studies\uc2  recently warned the policy was expensive and ineffective at targeting the poor, but Mr Clegg branded their criticisms "ludicrous".\par \par \uc2 He added: "To suggest to someone who earns \u163\'00\'A312,500 that they don't deserve that tax break is a ludicrous thing to say. \u163\'00\'A312,000 isn't rich . . . It's big it's bold, it's progressive, it's popular, and we should stick with it."\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140308ea38000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 PA News Feeds\par \b \uc2 Clegg accuses rivals of 'arrogance'\b0\par\par\uc2 659 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par 17:11\par \uc2 London Evening Standard Online\par \uc2 NSONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited.   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg has hit out at the Tories over their \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policies, claiming his coalition partners were "no longer standing up for business" by backing tougher curbs on migrants.\par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrat leader also accused both the Conservatives and Labour of "arrogance and cowardice" for suggesting that they could form a minority administration in the event of a hung parliament after the 2015 election.\par \par \uc2 But he faced criticism from grassroots activists about his focus on the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , with one councillor telling him "no one on the doorstep cares".\par \par \uc2 Answering questions from the audience at the Liberal Democrat spring conference, Mr Clegg singled out Tory \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister James Brokenshire for criticism, following a speech in which he s aid the wealthy had been the main winners from Britain's openness to labour from abroad, because they had to pay less for tradesmen and services.\par \par \uc2 He said: " Over the last 24 to 48 hours we have seen in many respect some of the most ugly sides of the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate. It is truly dispiriting to see the Conservative and Labour parties, the two largest parties in British politics, driven, as far as I can see, entirely by panic on this issues.\par \par \uc2 "You have got a Conservative Party which is no longer standing up for business - quite a big development, that. I think, personally they do so at their peril. The Institute of Directors absolutely slammed the irresponsible speech made by a Conservative minister this last week on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "And yet the Labour Party who won't stand up against xenophobia. Instead of trying to actually reduce the temperature of the debate, they try and stoke it."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg, whose hopes of remaining in power after 2015 depend on another coalition, attacked both Labour and the Tories over reports suggesting they could rule out any power-sharing deal in the event of a hung parliament.\par \par \uc2 Reports suggest that David Cameron is privately considering ruling out a coalition and promising to rule at the head of a minority administration if the Conservatives fail to secure an overall majority, and Unite general secretary Len McCluskey has also reportedly suggested that Labour should go it alone even if they fail to win the most seats.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg said there was an assumption within Labour that "government will drop into their lap" and they did not need to work for it.\par \par \uc2 "I have found it very striking to see this McCluskeyite tendency in both the Labour and Conservative Party who are now going one step further and saying 'even if we don't have a majority, we will govern Britain', which overlooks the slightly old-fashioned democratic principle that you have to win a majority before you have a right to say you will govern Britain.\par \par \uc2 "All of this just reveals a really unpleasant mix of arrogance and cowardice on the part of the two main parties, the two larger parties in British politics."\par \par \uc2 Asked why he was not campaigning for an outright Lib Dem win, Mr Clegg said: "I would love to be prime minister", to applause from the audience.\par \par \uc2 But then there was an awkward pause followed by laughter as he said: "Now let me explain how I'm getting there."\par \par \uc2 He added: "You can't put coalition on a ballot paper, what you can say is this: the alternative, in other words a Conservative-only government, or a Labour-only government, would in my view be very, very bad for this country indeed."\par \par \uc2 Councillor Jill Hope, from Northamptonshire, questioned the conference slogan "in Europe, in work", saying: "No one on the doorstep cares."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg told her: "People do care about work, they do care about money in their pockets, they do worry about crime on their streets, they do worry about what to do about climate change.\par \par \uc2 "You can't do anything about any of those things unless you work with other countries."\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140308ea38003h1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 As Tories stumble, Labour is quietly preparing for office; Conservatives should look in the mirror and ask themselves how badly they want to win\b0\par\par\uc2 By Matthew d\u8217\'20\'19Ancona   \par \uc2 1,251 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par 18:30\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s speech to the Lib Dem Spring Conference in York is intended to position his party as the unequivocally internationalist, pluralist alternative to Ukip. He and his strategists have limited ambitions for the European elections in May, seeking only a two or three per cent bounce: after nearly four years in the abattoir of unpopularity, it would be folly for the party to aim much higher at this stage.\par \par \uc2 As Nigel Farage grows ever more rhetorically fiery, Clegg believes that there is an electoral group of \u8220\'20\'1Csoft Tories" to be harvested, Conservative-inclined voters who wish \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  would confront Ukip wholeheartedly, instead of wavering between appeasement and polite disagreement. The Lib Dem leader\u8217\'20\'19s speech has been crafted as an appeal to them, as well as to his own tribe \u8211\'20\'13 a celebration of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s traditions of compassion, decency, and outward-looking magnificence.\par \par \uc2 The principal Lib Dem attack on Labour, on the other hand, is an unusual one: namely, that Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s party is \u8220\'20\'1Csilent". The Shadow Cabinet would noisily dispute that claim, of course, citing the speeches, policy announcements, Today interviews, cabaret performances, supermarket openings, tombola afternoons, visits to retirement homes and game-show appearances that have kept them clamorously busy. But there is something to the charge of \u8220\'20\'1Csilence", too.\par \par \uc2 In addition to the daily round of Opposition \u8211\'20\'13 shouting at the Government and scorning Cameron on the airwaves \u8211\'20\'13 Labour has stepped up a gear in its preparations for office. All parties out of power have to go through the motions of readying themselves for government, speaking to senior civil servants, as Labour has been entitled to do since last month (according to the convention established by John Major that such contact may begin 15 months before the end of a Parliament).\par \par \uc2 Much may happen in the remaining 14 months: Labour\u8217\'20\'19s unity may crumble, the statistical recovery may become palpable to voters, the public may ascribe this happier economic context to Conservative measures, ever-closer scrutiny may do for the Eds. Yet, as I write, the polls suggest that Miliband is heading for an 84-seat majority in May 2015. Quietly, the party is readying itself for this. This week, the \uc2 Institute for Public Policy Research\uc2  publishes a fine essay by Liz Kendall, the shadow minister for care and older people, and one of the party\u8217\'20\'19s rising stars, which makes the case for localisation of public services and a bold march by Labour into the terrain once marked out by Cameron as the \u8220\'20\'1CBig Society".\par \par \uc2 As Kendall argues: \u8220\'20\'1CPreventive, integrated and personalised support cannot be achieved via diktat from Whitehall." True: but how to release that grip? This has always been one of the great psychological problems facing Labour, and Kendall\u8217\'20\'19s exploration of the theme suggests a party \u8211\'20\'13 or at least some within it \u8211\'20\'13 preparing to face these dilemmas in practice as well as in theory.\par \par \uc2 Nobody on the Labour side likes to talk about this prospect much: Tony Blair taught Labour that complacency was electoral poison, that a politician should never confuse his own conviction with successful persuasion. Dig a little, however, and you will see much subterranean activity, as the party readies itself for the possibility of an unexpectedly early return to office.\par \par \uc2 The most public strand in this process is the zero-based review of public spending, disclosed by The Sunday Telegraph in September 2012, in which Ed Balls and his team claim to be examining how every penny of public money is spent. Obviously, this exercise is intended to have electoral force: evidence, like the party\u8217\'20\'19s promise in June 2013 to stick to Osborne\u8217\'20\'19s spending plans until 2015-16 and to\u160\'00\'A0impose a three-year welfare\u160\'00\'A0cap, of Labour\u8217\'20\'19s fiscal credibility.\par \par \uc2 Parallel to this runs the policy review headed by Jon Cruddas. All Opposition parties have a policy review, if only to prove that they still have a pulse. What distinguishes this one is the person leading it: Cruddas, a politician of real intellectual sinew who represents the so-called \u8220\'20\'1CBlue Labour" tradition of home, family and community that resists the commodification of humanity and often reaches conclusions that are hard to distinguish from moderate Toryism.\par \par \uc2 The least public, but most intriguing side of the triangle is the steering group headed by Lord Falconer of Thoroton, which is exploring the process and forms of government itself. Its purpose is, as one senior source puts it, \u8220\'20\'1Cto ensure that we hit the road running rather than just hit the road." The appointment of Falconer last October was in itself striking: he is, after all, a former flatmate of Blair who called publicly for a change in leadership in the dog days of \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s leadership. That Miliband, notionally a Brownite, should entrust the task of \u8220\'20\'1Cplanning and transition" to such an arch-Blairite suggests that this Labour leader is serious in his ambition, declared by Brown but never realised, to head a \u8220\'20\'1Cgovernment of all the talents".\par \par \uc2 Before 1997, Labour had been out of office for 18 years. Shadow cabinet members read Gerald Kaufman\u8217\'20\'19s How to Be a Minister; prospective Downing Street aides leafed through Marcia Falkender\u8217\'20\'19s Inside Number 10. This time, it is very different. There is help at hand from the independent Institute for Government, and from colleagues who were carrying red boxes less than four years ago.\par \par \uc2 Falconer \u8211\'20\'13 aided by Lord Adonis and Brown\u8217\'20\'19s former PPS, Jon Trickett \u8211\'20\'13 has been studying a range of issues: in particular, the role of \u8220\'20\'1Cthe Centre", and the best way in which No 10 and the Cabinet Office should drive through change. They have been exploring the correct role of the permanent civil service.\par \par \uc2 There is, I am told, a developing blueprint for administrative reform to ensure that Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s reforms are enacted. My strong hunch is that the relative positions of No 10 and the Treasury will figure in these calculations. It would indeed be farcical if the catastrophe of the Blair-Brown feud repeated itself under the next Labour government.\par \par \uc2 None of this, of course, means that Labour\u8217\'20\'19s scouting groups are drawing the right conclusions. It does mean that the party\u8217\'20\'19s alleged \u8220\'20\'1Csilence" is not necessarily a sign of inaction. Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s party still has a great mountain to climb but it is clearly determined to do so.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Tory party seems determined to make a fool of itself over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and the identity of its next leader. As the PM works the phones to prevent war in the Crimea, is this really a good moment to start a briefing war over who should succeed him? At this stage of the electoral cycle, every Tory muscle should be strained to keeping the incumbent Prime Minister where he is, and dismissing angrily all talk of runners and riders, Boris Johnson\u8217\'20\'19s plans, or who the \u8220\'20\'1Cstop Boris" candidate will be. All ministers should memorise James Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s unspeakably terrible speech on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as the Platonic ideal of election-losing rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 They should look in the mirror and ask how badly they really want to win this thing. A wise Cabinet veteran of the Major years told me last week that he felt his own party was going back to its constituencies and preparing for Opposition. He wants to be wrong. Is he?\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140308ea38005sp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 PA News Feeds\par \b \uc2 Clegg accuses rivals of 'arrogance'\b0\par\par\uc2 1,144 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par 19:20\par \uc2 London Evening Standard Online\par \uc2 NSONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited.   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg has hit out at the Tories over their \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policies, claiming his coalition partners were "no longer standing up for business" by backing tougher curbs on migrants.\par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrat leader also accused both the Conservatives and Labour of "arrogance and cowardice" for suggesting that they could form a minority administration in the event of a hung parliament after the 2015 election.\par \par \uc2 But he faced criticism from grassroots activists about his focus on the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , with one councillor telling him "no one on the doorstep cares".\par \par \uc2 Answering questions from the audience at the Liberal Democrat spring conference, Mr Clegg singled out Tory \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister James Brokenshire for criticism, following a speech in which he s aid the wealthy had been the main winners from Britain's openness to labour from abroad, because they had to pay less for tradesmen and services.\par \par \uc2 He said: " Over the last 24 to 48 hours we have seen in many respect some of the most ugly sides of the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate. It is truly dispiriting to see the Conservative and Labour parties, the two largest parties in British politics, driven, as far as I can see, entirely by panic on this issues.\par \par \uc2 "You have got a Conservative Party which is no longer standing up for business - quite a big development, that. I think, personally they do so at their peril. The Institute of Directors absolutely slammed the irresponsible speech made by a Conservative minister this last week on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "And yet the Labour Party who won't stand up against xenophobia. Instead of trying to actually reduce the temperature of the debate, they try and stoke it."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg, whose hopes of remaining in power after 2015 depend on another coalition, attacked both Labour and the Tories over reports suggesting they could rule out any power-sharing deal in the event of a hung parliament.\par \par \uc2 Reports suggest that David Cameron is privately considering ruling out a coalition and promising to rule at the head of a minority administration if the Conservatives fail to secure an overall majority, and Unite general secretary Len McCluskey has also reportedly suggested that Labour should go it alone even if they fail to win the most seats.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg said there was an assumption within Labour that "government will drop into their lap" and they did not need to work for it.\par \par \uc2 "I have found it very striking to see this McCluskeyite tendency in both the Labour and Conservative Party who are now going one step further and saying 'even if we don't have a majority, we will govern Britain', which overlooks the slightly old-fashioned democratic principle that you have to win a majority before you have a right to say you will govern Britain.\par \par \uc2 "All of this just reveals a really unpleasant mix of arrogance and cowardice on the part of the two main parties, the two larger parties in British politics."\par \par \uc2 Asked why he was not campaigning for an outright Lib Dem win, Mr Clegg said: "I would love to be prime minister", to applause from the audience.\par \par \uc2 But then there was an awkward pause followed by laughter as he said: "Now let me explain how I'm getting there."\par \par \uc2 He added: "You can't put coalition on a ballot paper, what you can say is this: the alternative, in other words a Conservative-only government, or a Labour-only government, would in my view be very, very bad for this country indeed."\par \par \uc2 Councillor Jill Hope, from Northamptonshire, questioned the conference slogan "in Europe, in work", saying: "No one on the doorstep cares."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg told her: "People do care about work, they do care about money in their pockets, they do worry about crime on their streets, they do worry about what to do about climate change.\par \par \uc2 "You can't do anything about any of those things unless you work with other countries."\par \par \uc2 Business Secretary Vince Cable also tore into the Tories over their \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policies, as the Lib Dems adopted proposals to make it easier for migrants' families to join them in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cable accused his coalition colleagues of tending to "fan the flames of prejudice" over the issue.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dem conference backed measures which could allow elderly relatives of migrants to join them in the UK if they paid a levy to cover their likely health costs.\par \par \uc2 Science, engineering and maths students from outside the EU would be allowed to work in the UK for up to three years after graduating and the plans would allow \uc2 the Migration Advisory Committee\uc2  to increase the number of people able to bring a spouse to join them in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Asylum seekers would be required to seek work after six months in the UK, and EU migrants would have to wait six months before being able to access the UK's benefits system under Europe-wide plans supported by the Lib Dems.\par \par \uc2 The Business Secretary said the Lib Dem proposals would help "persuade the public to calm down" about fears of the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Speaking at the Lib Dem spring conference in York, Mr Cable said: "It was never more necessary to have a party that was willing to stand up on this toxic issue and address it from the point of view of realism and evidence and fact.\par \par \uc2 "The Labour Party will always hide in a bunker when difficult issues like this come along and the Tories tend to fan the flames of prejudice and then they panic when it gets out of control and parties even further to the right take over.\par \par \uc2 "We have an acute responsibility here."\par \par \uc2 He said Liberals had stood up for the rights of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , be they Jews from eastern Europe in the early 20th century, East African Asians and citizens from Hong Kong.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cable said: "We have got the same challenge today and we have got to meet it. One of the ways of meeting it is to be realistic and address people's genuine concerns."\par \par \uc2 The party also backed calls for an early review of the Government's national planning policy framework and a public consultation and measures to limit central government interference in local decisions.\par \par \uc2 The conference supported constitutional reforms towards a federal UK, including devolving powers to Cornwall.\par \par \uc2 The coalition's welfare reforms were also questioned, with activists endorsing a motion on food poverty stating that "current measures offer inadequate protection to some families in deepest need" and calling for "an urgent independent review into the relationship between benefit delay, error or sanctions and the growth of food poverty".\par \par \uc2 Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander used his speech to claim credit for the Lib Dems for the economic recovery and to signal the party's commitment to raising the income tax threshold to \u163\'00\'A312,500.\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140309ea380002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NEWS\par \b \uc2 Do I employ any foreigners? Well I do have a Portuguese cleaner; Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Treasury Secretary, is forced to admit on air that his cleaner is an \uc2 immigrant\b0\par\par\uc2 By Robert Mendick and Matthew Holehouse   \par \uc2 932 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par 20:00\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The Coalition is facing fresh embarrassment over the issue of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  after a senior Cabinet minister was forced to admit he employed a Portuguese cleaner.\par \par \uc2 Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, began to stutter and stumble during a live radio interview on Saturday after being asked if he employed \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . At first Mr Alexander, a Liberal Democrat, avoided the question.\par \par \uc2 Asked by \uc2 Mishal Husain\uc2 , the presenter of Radio 4\u8217\'20\'19s Today programme, \u8220\'20\'1CDo you employ anyone from another country?" Mr Alexander replied: \u8220\'20\'1CEr, er, urm, er, erm \u8230\'20\'26 in the Treasury there are people from all around the world working in the, er, Treasury."\par \par \uc2 Miss Husain then explained her question referred to Mr Alexander\u8217\'20\'19s own household, not the large Government department where he works.\par \par \uc2 Pressed on whether he employed any foreigners, Mr Alexander finally responded: \u8220\'20\'1CEr, ar, er, er \u8230\'20\'26 we use a brilliant British, er \u8230\'20\'26 child minder and a, er\u8230\'20\'26 Portuguese lady occasionally comes in to clean our home."\par \par \uc2 The employment of foreign domestic help by senior ministers has come under scrutiny after the apparent criticism of the practice by James Brokenshire, the new \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister. Mr Brokenshire, a Conservative, condemned a \u8220\'20\'1Cwealthy metropolitan elite" for benefiting from the cheap services offered by \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . Their gain, he said last week in his first speech in the job, had been at the expense of \u8220\'20\'1Cordinary, hard-working people in this country".\par \par \uc2 The speech has caused embarrassment for the Government, with ministers being questioned on whether they benefit from \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  workers. It has emerged \u8722\'22\'12 as a result \u8722\'22\'12 that \uc2 Samantha Cameron\uc2  was involved in the family\u8217\'20\'19s foreign-born nanny securing British citizenship in 2010 while she was working for Mrs Cameron and her husband. Mrs Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s name was entered on an application form for British citizenship for her long-term nanny, Gita Lima, who is from Nepal.\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, has admitted having a \u8220\'20\'1Clady who has a Belgian passport who helps us", while Theresa May, Mr Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s boss, conceded she uses a Brazilian-born cleaner.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Mrs May said: \u8220\'20\'1CTheresa May\u8217\'20\'19s cleaner is a British citizen but she was born in Brazil. Theresa had no role at all in her cleaner\u8217\'20\'19s application for citizenship."\par \par \uc2 The disclosures will likely fuel the view of some that the Coalition is part of the \u8220\'20\'1Cwealthy metropolitan elite" condemned by Mr Brokenshire and is out of touch with ordinary voters. One senior source said Mr Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s comments had simply drawn attention to ministers\u8217\'20\'19 own household arrangements.\par \par \uc2 In his interview on Saturday, Mr Alexander went on to defend his employment of a Portuguese cleaner. \u8220\'20\'1CAs a country, our reputation for tolerance, our reputation for being open-minded, is incredibly important to us and when you get to a position where people and businesses who employ people from other countries are criticised just for that, I think that is getting to a pretty poisonous position."\par \par \uc2 He added: \u8220\'20\'1CIt is a sorry position where we have got to be asking those sorts of questions because it is based on an assumption that somehow a business or an individual who is employing someone from another European country is doing something wrong."\par \par \uc2 After the interview, an aide to Mr Alexander denied he had been hesitant in answering the question or had tried to avoid it, possibly for fear of appearing out of touch. The aide said: \u8220\'20\'1CThat is 180 degrees away from what happened. Danny Alexander doesn\u8217\'20\'19t worry about things like that. If he has a cleaner, he has a cleaner. It\u8217\'20\'19s a matter of fact."\par \par \uc2 Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Business Secretary, waded further into the row, accusing Conservatives of \u8220\'20\'1Cfanning the flames of prejudice".\par \par \uc2 His intervention will widen the rift between the two parties with a European election campaign to fight in May and a general election next year.\par \par \uc2 In a speech at the Lib Dem spring conference in York, Mr Cable said: \u8220\'20\'1CIt was never more necessary to have a party that was willing to stand up on this toxic issue and address it from the point of view of realism and evidence and fact.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Labour Party will always hide in a bunker when difficult issues like this come along and the Tories tend to fan the flames of prejudice and then they panic when it gets out of control and parties even further to the Right take over."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg told the conference that Mr Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s speech was \u8220\'20\'1Cugly" and \u8220\'20\'1Cirresponsible" and said the Conservatives\u8217\'20\'19 position on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  had been \u8220\'20\'1Cabsolutely slammed" by the Institute of Directors. \u8220\'20\'1CIt is truly dispiriting to see the Conservatives and Labour party driven entirely by panic on this issue.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Conservative Party is no longer standing up for business. They do so at their peril."\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Labour Party won\u8217\'20\'19t stand up against xenophobia and instead of trying to reduce the temperature of the debate they try and stoke it.

In that role she would have been expected to support her claim for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 A No10 spokesman said: \u8216\'20\'18Mr and Mrs Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s nanny became a British citizen in late 2010. Mr and Mrs Cameron did not write a letter supporting their nanny\u8217\'20\'19s application for British citizenship. The normal application process was\u160\'00\'A0 followed throughout.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Mrs May said: \u8216\'20\'18Theresa May\u8217\'20\'19s cleaner is a British citizen but she was born in Brazil. Theresa had no role at all in her cleaner\u8217\'20\'19s application for citizenship.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 But the fresh revelations will fuel the view of many voters that Cabinet ministers are part of the \u8216\'20\'18wealthy metropolitan elite\u8217\'20\'19 criticised by Tory Mr Brokenshire.\par \par \uc2 And the details are likely to spark cries of hypocrisy among those who employ cleaners and nannies at the way ministers are prepared to\u160\'00\'A0 criticise people who hire \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  workers while doing exactly the same themselves.\par \par \uc2 In a speech on Thursday, Mr Brokenshire said: \u8216\'20\'18For too long, the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour, or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services, but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The issue is particularly acute since Mr Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s predecessor Mark Harper was forced to resign after it emerged that he had employed a cleaner who was working in Britain illegally.\par \par \uc2 A Downing Street spokesman made clear that the Camerons employed Miss Lima not because she was cheap but because she was the best person for the job.\par \par \uc2 The candour of Mrs May and the Camerons was not matched by all in the Cabinet. The Daily Mail yesterday asked 20 of its members if they employed foreign workers as cleaners, nannies, builders and home helps.\par \par \uc2 However, the majority of those questioned failed to provide a substantive response.\par \par \uc2 Labour MP John Mann said they should come clean, adding: \u8216\'20\'18They should be seeking out British staff.

It was bulldozed by the government and she's now one of a pack of kids in a shanty town called Paradise. Her father has gone to South Africa to find work, and comes back only to die of Aids.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Ukip The remarkable rise of Ukip is based on the party's appeal to a wide range of disaffected voters, Alice Thomson and Rachel Sylvester report\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  compares his battle with the UK Independence Party at the European Elections to taking part in a pub quiz. Nigel Farage, he complains, "gets to choose his favourite subject to be the joker round on which he can get double points". There is no doubt in his mind that Ukip could come first this May.\par \par \uc2 As the mainstream parties prepare to be trounced when Britain goes to the polls in ten weeks' time, Mr Farage's party has become the joker in the Westminster pack, the most successful insurgent challenge to the political establishment since the war.\par \par \uc2 This is a rag-bag collection of individuals, dismissed as fruitcakes and fools, mavericks and mischief-makers. It has no real economic policy and its leader recently disowned its entire manifesto for the previous general election. Of the 21 Ukip MEPs elected to the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  since 1999, two have gone to jail and seven have either defected or resigned from the party, a 40 per cent attrition rate. Yet it is now widely expected that Ukip will beat the Conservatives into third place in the European elections and it could even topple Labour from the top slot. Its local government powerbase is also expanding rapidly. At last year's polls, the party won 147 county council seats. This time, it is standing 2,500 candidates in councils up and down the country. It no longer seems impossible that Ukip might soon have an MP. The party has come second in the past six parliamentary by-elections and, at between 12 and 18 per cent, it is regularly ahead of the Liberal Democrats in the national polls.\par \par \uc2 While the mainstream parties are haemorrhaging activists, Ukip's grassroots base is growing: it now has 35,000 members. Even the youth wing, Young Independence, is thriving, with 1,700 members, branches on university campus across the country and a black-tie Winter Ball. Mr Farage has been accepted into London's smartest drawing rooms; at one recent dinner party he entertained Jemima Khan and Lord Mandelson with his stories of Brussels excess.\par \par \uc2 The party, founded 21 years ago in a dusty room at the LSE by a history professor, believes it has come of age. Mr Farage told his spring conference: "We are on the march." Stewart Wheeler, the spread-betting millionaire and party Treasurer, says: "We are attacking any seat we think we can win. Twenty years ago in Canada, the Reform Party had no seats, then they got one seat in a by-election and then they won at the election. It shows it can be done."\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron is swerving in Ukip's direction at every opportunity on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and Europe and Nick Clegg has challenged Mr Farage to a leader's debate. Ukip is the one to watch but the appeal of "Nigel's barmy army" has been greatly misunderstood.\par \par \uc2 The widely held assumption is that Ukip is a party for disgruntled Bufton-Tufton Tories who hate Brussels and foreigners. In fact the majority of Ukip voters are blue collar workers who are more worried about wages than Europe. According to a YouGov poll for The Times, 52 per cent of Mr Farage's supporters are from the C2DE social groups, compared with 46 per cent for Labour, 43 per cent for the Tories, and 32 per cent for the Lib Dems. "Ukip is the most working class party," says Matthew Goodwin of \uc2 Nottingham University\uc2 , whose book Revolt on the Right is out this week. "Its voters are economically disadvantaged, with few skills. These are people who feel left behind. What Ukip tells us is that there are very deep social divisions in Britain. It represents the common man against the political elite."\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron is "the best recruiting serjeant for Ukip", he says. "He represents the set of values that these voters hate."\par \par \uc2 Paul Sykes, the millionaire Yorkshire businessman who has promised to bankroll Ukip's European election campaign, believes Brussels is the ultimate out-of-touch establishment. "All the suits have done very well out of the EU, it's the working man who has suffered," he says.\par \par \uc2 "Working class voters are feeling betrayed. I'm hoping that's where we are going to get the majority of our votes."\par \par \uc2 Paul Nuttall, Ukip's deputy leader, confirms that the party intends to target Labour seats. "There's a move amongst working class people towards Ukip. They like what we stand for and what we talk about. We've moved away from being a single issue party and with the collapse of the Lib Dems people are looking for an anti-politics choice."\par \par \uc2 According to Dave Rowlands, chairman of Ukip in South East Wales: "In the Welsh valleys the response is amazing. We are no longer the nutters. I get chased down the street with people asking questions. The \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  haven't taken bankers', politicians' or media jobs, but working class jobs. Labour has forgotten us, the grafters at the bottom, Ukip hasn't."\par \par \uc2 In Scotland, David Coburn, a gay Glaswegian air-freight entrepreneur, hopes to become Ukip's first Scottish elected politician in May. He explains: "It's all very well for the middle classes, the lawyers and doctors to insist it isn't a problem but for ordinary working men and women, uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  depresses their wages and it places a burden on the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and social services."\par \par \uc2 It is easy to criticise Mr Farage for lacking policy. The appeal of Ukip, however, has nothing to do with ideology, or ideas, it's about culture.\par \par \uc2 After the Eastleigh by-election, the Liberal Democrats conducted a focus group with voters who had switched from their party to Ukip. All listed problems with Britain: the cost of housing, traffic, "new-fangled" computers. At the end, the moderator turned to the group and asked what they thought was the best thing about this country. "There was a deathly silence," according to one of those present. "Then one guy leaned forward and said, 'the past'."\par \par \uc2 According to the YouGov polling for The Times, Ukip voters are far more pessimistic than others about the prospects for the economy, their neighbourhoods and their families; 80 per cent think there is little chance of today's young adults prospering over the next ten years and 56 per cent think Britain's "best years are behind us".\par \par \uc2 These voters do not expect Ukip to be running the health service or dealing with the deficit. They want to express a far more general sense of anxiety and anger. Mr Farage's description of Britain as "unrecognisable", with English rarely spoken on a commuter train, is a deliberate attempt to tap into this mood.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Cooper\uc2 , who was until recently director of strategy at No 10, says: "The defining attitude of Ukip voters is, 'I don't recognise the country I live in any more'. It's about antipathy to the pace of social change. It's not about a specific issue, it's about a feeling."\par \par \uc2 When Lord Ashcroft, the former Tory chairman, did research among Ukip voters, it was an overwhelming sense of "dissatisfaction" that came through. "Schools, they say, can't hold nativity plays or harvest festivals any more; you can't fly a flag of St George any more; you can't call Christmas Christmas any more ... you can't even smack your children." The mainstream parties were "so in thrall to the prevailing culture of political correctness that they have ceased to represent the silent majority", these people felt.\par \par \uc2 Neil Hamilton, the former Tory MP who was embroiled in the cash-for-questions affair, and is now Ukip's deputy chairman, claims that 40 per cent of the people who intend to support Ukip say they would stay at home, rather than voting for another party. "Now the divide isn't between left and right but between Ukip and the rest," he says. "This is a peasants' revolt. Ukip has brought people back into politics."\par \par \uc2 He and his wife, Christine, were wooed by Mr Farage over a "four-bottle lunch" at Shepherd's, a traditional Westminster haunt that has since closed down.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Hamilton, a star of reality TV shows and pantomimes, is not bothered by the occasional eccentric comment. "Of course I don't clean behind my fridge, and of course I'm not a slut \u8212\'20\'14 that was a joke. All parties have sexist pigs in them." The appeal, she says, is that "Ukip is a grassroots party, it comes from the bottom up".\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage adopted the local "pavement politics" approach once deployed so successfully by the Lib Dems when they were the main recipients of "protest votes". Ukip candidates are encouraged to go canvassing with a pet. "The British love animals so of course you take the dog," says one insider. "It's comforting and British." They have also been instructed to discuss the weather.\par \par \uc2 The party's messages are carefully honed for particular communities.\par \par \uc2 In Somerset, Ukip has been out front in calling for dredging of local rivers. In the Chilterns, it is winning support by opposing the HS2 rail network. In London, the mayoral candidate Lawrence Webb promised 15 minutes free parking across the capital and a clampdown on fines which he describes as "an extortion racket". In the countryside Ukip talks about hunting and hay. Around 16 per cent of \uc2 Countryside Alliance\uc2  members say they are now backing Mr Farage. "Ukip are clever," says Tim Bonner, head of campaigns.\par \par \uc2 "There is a perception that the Government has focused too much on suburban and urban issues. Ukip has some bizarre policies but people are looking for an alternative."\par \par \uc2 There has been some inconsistency as a result of this localised approach. At the recent Wythenshaw and Sale East by-election, Ukip's campaign literature promised to "protect your jobs and benefits" \u8212\'20\'14 even though its head of policy, Tim Akers, had complained only five months before about the "soaring benefits bill".\par \par \uc2 Among Ukip supporters, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is a unifying issue. "We have always been a welcoming nation but we can't be drowned by millions of people sweeping in," says Peter Brown from Bristol.\par \par \uc2 Most also have their own pet concern. Suzanne Evans, the national communities and women spokesman, was a Conservative councilor but defected to Ukip. "I have always been a great campaigner over female genital mutilation and the Tories didn't take it seriously," she explains. "Nigel Farage has."\par \par \uc2 Stephen Wood, chairman of Ukip in Bristol, is a retired police officer and now a bailiff and private investigator. "The police force is being decimated yet policemen from Europe can come and arrest someone here for the smallest misdemeanour," he says. "I am a private detective and the amount of red tape is ludicrous."\par \par \uc2 A former supporter explains: "The party is a list of slogans rather than a manifesto. They were pro guns, now they don't mention that, they are suddenly pro-dredging. They will be pro-hunting and pro-the badger cull now but only in the West Country of course. They will fling themselves on any bandwagon and cling on until it crashes."\par \par \uc2 A friend of Mr Farage said: "Nigel's very clever at working out local trigger points. It's not about Europe any more, it's a protest movement, with people using Ukip to show what's bothering them. It feels like dry grass burning, you light a small patch you want to burn and suddenly the whole field's on fire. Nigel says, 'keep going, you can't throw cold water on everything now. Let it burn'."\par \par \uc2 'Ukip has some bizarre policies but people are looking for an alternative' Tim Bonner, Ukip head of campaigns\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140309ea380002g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Camerons reveal how nanny got UK passport\b0\par\par\uc2 Francis Elliott   \par \uc2 485 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2014\par \uc2 The Times\par \uc2 T\par \uc2 1; Scotland\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Samantha Cameron\uc2  was named on an application for British citizenship made by the family's Nepalese nanny that succeeded just a few months after the 2010 election, No 10 said last night.\par \par \uc2 Downing Street released the information as it struggled to contain the fallout caused by a Home Office minister's claim that the "wealthy, metropolitan elite" were fuelling migration. James Brokenshire's accusation has thrown the spotlight on coalition ministers, such as \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and Nick Clegg, who employ foreign staff. In its efforts to fight off accusations of double standards No 10 revealed that the Camerons' nanny was now a British citizen. That led to questions over how Gita Lima had secured a British passport and to calls from Labour for "complete transparency and openness".\par \par \uc2 "There should not be any delay in providing this information so that people can be assured that he has acted appropriately," Phil Wilson, the Labour MP for Sedgefield, said.\par \par \uc2 After initially refusing to answer queries over Ms Lima's application and what steps the Prime Minister took to ensure he did not exert undue influence over the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  authorities, Downing Street released a statement.\par \par \uc2 "Mr and Mrs Cameron's nanny became a British citizen in late 2010. Mr and Mrs Cameron did not write a letter supporting their nanny's application for British citizenship. The normal application process was followed throughout. As is usual, Mrs Cameron was named on her application as her employer," it said.\par \par \uc2 Ms Lima was hired by the Camerons in the latter half of the last decade through Kalayaan, a charity that helps \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to escape abusive bosses.\par \par \uc2 The charity has been critical of a 2012 change in the visa rules that limits foreign domestic staff to working for a named employer and sets a six-month deadline on their residency. Ms Lima took a leave of absence in 2012 but has since returned to work to help the Camerons look after their three children. The focus on the nanny, which comes at the end of a week of coalition rows over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , has infuriated senior Conservatives. Mr Brokenshire had been intending to draw a line between the Tory and Liberal Democrat positions on migration when he blamed middle-class employers.\par \par \uc2 "For too long, the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour, or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services, but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country," he said in a speech to the Demos think-tank on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether Mr Cameron and his wife had chosen their nanny on the basis of cost, a spokeswoman said: "I think they were guided by someone who would look after their children in the way they wanted to."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg said yesterday that he employs a Belgian as domestic help.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140309ea38000nd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Ukip faces significant challenges in run-up to general election\b0\par\par\uc2 Matthew Goodwin Robert Ford   \par \uc2 theguardian.com\par \uc2 1,027 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 Guardian.co.uk\par \uc2 GRULTD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Guardian News & Media Limited. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage's party needs to win over the young, women and ethnic minorities as well as overcome barriers of first-past-the-post system\par \par \uc2 Over the next 15 months, Britain's political debate will focus heavily on the prospect of a breakthrough by Ukip at the 2015 general election. For a new and untested party, however, overcoming the barriers of a first-past-the-post electoral system will be incredibly difficult, never mind competing successfully against three established and well resourced parties that can each trace their roots back over a century. Aside from these wider challenges that meet all new parties in British politics, Nigel Farage and Ukip also face more specific problems.\par \par \uc2 Over the past year, and for our book Revolt on the Right, we investigated the backgrounds and concerns of over 100,000 British voters, including almost 6,000 who intend to support Ukip. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, which would have you believe that the average Ukip voter is a relatively secure, middle-class Conservative who is motivated only by their distrust of Brussels and perhaps also David Cameron, the true nature of this support is quite different; old, working class, poorly educated, male and driven by intense concerns not only about the EU but how Labour and the Conservatives have managed \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , the financial crisis and the state of our politics more generally. These are voters who have been shaped by the social and economic changes over the past five decades, and who hold a fundamentally different set of values; they see a world and a way of life slipping away, feel powerless to stop it happening, and are angry at the established political class for not seeming to understand their concerns, or care about what is being lost. These intense beliefs are not likely to be resolved by a new party leader, a referendum promise or a net migration target. Ukip's revolt has been a long time coming, and it may have a long way to run yet.\par \par \uc2 But our analysis also sheds light on several groups in Britain whom Ukip needs to win over if it is to mobilise a truly historic revolt, but who are currently resistant to Farage's charms. First, Ukip currently has little or no appeal among the half of the British electorate who do not share their intense hostility towards the EU. That non-Eurosceptics do not find Ukip appealing is fairly obvious, but it is also a problem for the party; even when voters share their intense concerns over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and the state of politics but are not animated by the EU, they remain unwilling to back Farage; 95% of Ukip voters disapprove of Britain's EU membership but less than one in200 who think otherwise back the party. In other words, Ukip's anti-EU image is so strong that it is preventing them from winning over a far larger pool of voters who share their resentment of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and mainstream politicians but do not stay awake at night worrying about the EU.\par \par \uc2 Second, Ukip is consistently failing to win over three large groups of voters; the young, women and ethnic minorities. Women are the largest of these groups and though many share Ukip's views over Europe, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and threats to national identity, they are significantly less receptive than men. Almost 60% of Ukip's electorate is male, making it the most male-dominated of all parties (only the BNP, in earlier years, had a stronger male bias). Ukip has sought to present women candidates, notably in parliamentary byelections and on Question Time, but the party remains hampered by this "gender gap".\par \par \uc2 The story with ethnic minorities, meanwhile, is to be expected; just 0.4% of Ukip's electorate is non-white. Put another way, only one out of every 250 Ukip supporters is not white. The equivalent figure for Labour is 3.7%, and for the Liberal Democrats 1.7%. That Ukip's revolt is overwhelmingly white will not come as a surprise, although it is interesting to note that many rightwing parties are grappling with the same problem (the equivalent figure for the Conservatives is just 1.1%). But amidst an era of rapidly rising ethnic diversity, this and another problem raises questions over the long-term sustainability of this insurgency.\par \par \uc2 Ukip is also a very grey revolt, which adds another dark cloud over their long-term prospects \u8211\'20\'13 although, of course, generational change takes a long time! In fact 57% of Ukip's supporters are over the age of 54 but only one in 10 are under 35. During one of our interviews with Farage the Ukip leader recognised this specific problem, conceding that his party is "not connecting with disaffected youth". He is right. While young Britons have struggled amidst the crisis, they are also much less concerned about Ukip's agenda of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , the EU and rapid social change, and feel broadly comfortable with the identity and values of modern Britain. They have only ever known Britain as an EU member state, and our society as one of mass migration, much of which has come from the EU. The students we teach at our universities, for example, were born between 1993 and 1995, and most likely went to school alongside EU or non-EU migrants. They simply don't know anything else, and most likely think that Ukip's worldview is markedly out of touch with their own experiences.\par \par \uc2 Ukip's revolt on the right is recruiting significant support among specific groups, but it is not one of unbridled potential. Like all political parties, Ukip face some big challenges going forward that will need to be overcome if they are to meet their ambitions of causing a more damaging earthquake in British politics. Much rests on the shoulders of Farage, and on the next 15 months.\par \par \uc2 Revolt on the Right: Explaining Public Support for the Radical Right in Britain, a new book by Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford, is published next week.\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140308ea39000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

Or, to put it another way, Mr Brokenshire had landed his boss \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  right in it.\par \par \uc2 Nannygate - and, for that matter, Cleanergate, Chauffergate and Gardenergate - has begun, as myriad ministers, employing \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to tend to their domestic chores and childcare needs, are hunted down by the media.\par \par \uc2 Having only just camouflaged their duck houses and stables to avoid rumours about expenses, MPs will probably be spending the next several days rapidly raising the wages of their poorly paid domestic retainers; brutally sacking illegals and calling the Columbian au pair, a distant cousin, twice removed. They have Mr Brokenshire to thank.\par \par \uc2 He has - albeit inadvertently - delivered a triple political whammy. He drew attention to the exclusive habits of the "wealthy metropolitan elite" who head his team and who ignore their own advice not to hire "cheap labour"; he triggered particular examination of the man at the top, and his wife, Samantha, who may or may not have been instrumental in helping her Nepalese nanny Gita Lima to secure British citizenship (fee: pounds 874).\par \par \uc2 Brokenshire also highlighted the ineffectiveness of the coalition's controls on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . It's not a bad run of hits for a ministerial first speech, although it may be a long time before there is a second. The Camerons' hiring of Lima was followed by short-term employment of an Australian, Sammi Strange. Such is the nature of globalisation that London parks - since this is largely metropolitan elite behaviour - are full of women from the Philippines, Poland, Estonia and central and south America earning a living abroad.\par \par \uc2 In a fair world, they ought not to come cheap, certainly not cheaper than the British nursery nurses on pounds 12,000 a year. But not as costly as a British-made Norland nanny - often employed in (wealthy) homes abroad - on around pounds 50,000 after three years' training.\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire's moral outrage that foreigners come here to care for our children might have been tempered, and the increasingly divisive \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate eased, if he'd remembered that, for some time thousands of young British women have left these shores. Kitty Strutton, a bricklayer's daughter from Hackney, took care of Grand Duke Alexander of Russia in the 1840s. When she died, Alexander II, Tsar of Russia and his four brothers carried her coffin.\par \par \uc2 Again, Anna Leonowens in her 30s took on the 82 children (and 39 wives) of Mongkut, the King of Siam, and, one presumes, nobody asked to see her \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  status.\par \par \uc2 The worlds of the elite and \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  have always been intertwined, and rarely at a decent price, especially when it comes to care. That's what ought to shock more than the scale of the unfortunate Mr Brokenshire's political clangers and the number of Bulgarian cleaners now out of ministerial closets.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140308ea3900010\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer New Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 Let's be clear: we need more \uc2 immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 Kevin McKenna   \par \uc2 1,083 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 37\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The most uplifting and affirmative action I've seen this year occurred in distressing circumstances in Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street. The event was filmed by BBC Scotland for their series, The Street, chronicling the reality of life on Scotland's liveliest boulevard. In it we see Melo, a young African street musician, being racially abused by two white thugs. After one of the men approached him for the purposes of calling him a "black bastard", this is what we subsequently heard:\par \par \uc2 "What about the fucking British or the homeless? You are taking the fucking piss. You are milking our country for thousands, ya fucking black bastard.\par \par \uc2 "How much do you make sitting here busking every fucking day? You're making thousands. I pay taxes every fucking month; hundreds of pounds to keep you in the fucking country.\par \par \uc2 "You are a black bastard, admit it."\par \par \uc2 One of the white gargoyles then attempts to assault him. Melo, though, was having none of it and began rebuking his assailants while defending himself with a small trolley he had been using as a prop. Melo, who looks like a chap with substantial reserves of character and courage, decides he might as well go down fighting. "Get away from me," he tells them. "Any more and I will batter you both to the floor." It's thought that Melo had come to live in Glasgow after fleeing from the civil war in Angola, his home country.\par \par \uc2 For generations now, we Scots have congratulated ourselves that we don't have a racial problem on anything like the scale that exists in parts of England. It's a complacent attitude and one that has been blown apart since the start of this year. For there have been several other incidents reported in the press and television that have been as sickening as the attack on Melo. Two weeks ago a 17-year-old schoolboy making his debut in senior football had to be substituted when he became distressed at the abuse he was receiving from some supporters of Peterhead FC in the north east of Scotland.\par \par \uc2 On another occasion, Humza Yousaf, a young Asian MSP at Holyrood was subjected, in daylight, to a violent and racist tirade while selling the Big Issue. He had agreed to do this to raise awareness of issues surrounding homeless people in Scotland.\par \par \uc2 Few would suggest that these incidents mean that Scotland suddenly has a problem with racism. Yet we ought also to acknowledge that for each of these that were reported and recorded there will be dozens more that go unchronicled. Nor would it be wise to oversimplify the reasons why we are witnessing these bubbles on the surface of the cesspit. Yet it seems to me to be inescapable that some of these reasons are similar to those that we encounter when trying to explain the relatively sudden rise of a party like Ukip in Britain.\par \par \uc2 This is a party which, in the absence of any coherent economic, social or cultural policy, has become a significant power in England and Wales on the back of one of the most wicked deceptions ever practised on our southern neighbours: that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is intrinsically bad, that indolent people from "undesirable" countries (eastern Europe and most of Africa) are taking white Anglo-Saxon jobs, and that they are placing an unsustainable burden on the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and our system of benefits.\par \par \uc2 This has combined with a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment fuelled by tragic events such as the slaying of Private Lee Rigby. Rapidly, it seems, a residual fear and distrust of Islam, which had always lurked on the periphery of what we could call outright racism, has entered the mainstream. And it has done so as large elements of British society have begun to express themselves in distorted and strident militarism. In this, the humble poppy has also become a casualty. Once it was a silent and lovely memoriam to noble sacrifice, now it is used by our political and military elite to engender a sense of triumphalism. Not to be seen sporting a poppy in the month of November is to risk being accused of treason.\par \par \uc2 Much of this may be justified when Britain is facing mortal peril. But, in the absence of such, too many of us begin to look for an enemy within. Those who are other and different and puzzling become easy targets, especially those who are foolish enough to look content and prosperous. How dare they?\par \par \uc2 And now it seems that some of the tendrils of this creeping disease have reached Scotland. Well, we had better start to look aboot us, because these have the capacity to poison us. And we had better also start being loud and aggressive with the opposite message: Scotland needs more \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . If we still think that old age deserves choice and quality of life then some facts must be faced. Britain has an ageing population and Scotland's is ageing more rapidly than that of the rest of the UK. We need another one million \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  in this country paying taxes and national insurance as well as purchasing goods and services. This they tend to do and they tend not to get as sick and depressed as the rest of us. Happily, the SNP is the world's only nationalist party which actually welcomes \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . The Scottish Labour party, when it governed, enshrined this, too.\par \par \uc2 It's good to walk down the streets of your city and behold the sights and sounds and smells of different people from far away countries. How can that ever be bad?\par \par \uc2 In England in the 16th century, in a time considered to be more inhumane and uncivilised, the words of William Shakespeare (from Sir Thomas More) resonate still:\par \par \uc2 "Imagine that you see the wretched strangers,\par \par \uc2 Their babies at the backs, and their poor luggage\par \par \uc2 Plodding to th' ports and coast for transportation[. . .]\par \par \uc2 Should so much come too short of your great trespass\par \par \uc2 As but to banish you: whither would you go?\par \par \uc2 What country, by the nature of your error,\par \par \uc2 Should give you harbour?[. . .]\par \par \uc2 Why you must needs be strangers. Would you be pleased\par \par \uc2 To find a nation of such barbarous temper\par \par \uc2 That breaking out into hideous violence\par \par \uc2 Would not afford you an abode on earth,\par \par \uc2 Whet their detested knives against your throats,\par \par \uc2 Spurn you like dogs[? . . .]\par \par \uc2 [. . .] This is the strangers' case\par \par \uc2 And this your mountainish inhumanity."\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140308ea390001d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PEOPLE\par \par \uc2 Who's more red than blue?\par \par \uc2 Vince Cable, business secretary. Cable, a Labour councillor in Glasgow in the 1970s, has always been closer to Labour than Tories. The big question is: would he serve in a second coalition with the Tories?\par \par \uc2 Simon Hughes\uc2 , justice minister and MP for Bermondsey, with its big housing estates, is unashamedly left on many issues. Has said the benefits cap will "damage the lives of hundreds of thousands of children".\par \par \uc2 Tim Farron, president of the Liberal Democrats, seems to find life with the Tories close to unbearable. Has described Tory \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  proposals as "ugly and stupid".\par \par \uc2 ISSUES\par \par \uc2 On what do Libs swing Left?\par \par \uc2 Education\par \par \uc2 Liberal Democrats detest the idea of allowing state schools to be run for profit, which is one of Michael Gove's objectives.\par \par \uc2 Also, they oppose the use of unqualified teachers. On both issues the party dovetails with Labour.\par \par \uc2 Taxing the rich\par \par \uc2 They want a mansion tax to hit owners of properties worth more than pounds 2m, something Cameron will not do, and want tax cuts for low earners more than for the middle classes.\par \par \uc2 Europe\par \par \uc2 Pro-EU through and through, setting them miles apart from Tories and closer to Labour. Most Tories are now prepared to contemplate leaving the EU. Lib Dems are as determined as ever to be in there.\par \par \uc2 Health\par \par \uc2 Opposition to the market-based reforms of the \uc2 NHS\uc2  led by Tory health secretary Andrew Lansley was a key part of the Liberal Democrat plan to show clear blue water between them and the Tories.\par \par \uc2 NORTH/SOUTH DIVIDE.\par \par \uc2 Northern Lib Dems swing left to compete with Labour. They are angry that the coalition is not doing more to support the northern economy.\par \par \uc2 PEOPLE\par \par \uc2 Who's more blue than red?\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg, leader. Clegg was demonstrably happy to join a coalition with the Tories in 2010. He now says they have got worse, but is still regarded as more on the right than left.\par \par \uc2 Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury. Has been mocked by his party for being George's Osborne's willing accomplice. Condemned Ed Balls for proposing the reintroduction of the 50p tax rate.\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Browne, former home office minister who is so far to the right he almost falls off the edge. Criticised the Lib Dems for being a trolley that always veers to the left.\par \par \uc2 David Laws, education minister. Has called for deeper spending cuts and "lower marginal rates of tax at all income levels", though recently tore into Gove over independence of \uc2 Ofsted\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ISSUES.\par \par \uc2 On what do they swing right?\par \par \uc2 Economy\par \par \uc2 Clegg, Alexander and Laws have been determined backers of Osborne's austerity plan and have not been derailed from that view by claims that deep public sector cuts have damaged growth. A lean state is best.\par \par \uc2 Tuition fees\par \par \uc2 Despite the huge damage inflicted upon Clegg's reputation, the party signed up to university tuition fees and is now refusing to budge on the issue. Labour wants to reform the system, but the Liberal Democrats believe the subject has been settled.\par \par \uc2 Welfare\par \par \uc2 Clegg's party is as one with the Tories on both the bedroom tax and the benefits cap. Clegg has echoed the Conservative line that limiting benefits to pounds 500 a week will encourage people to move back into work.\par \par \uc2 NORTH/SOUTH DIVIDE.\par \par \uc2 On some issues - particularly Europe - Lib Dems in the south have to tack more to the right. Euro-enthusiasm is not a vote winner in the south-west where they remain strong.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140308ea390001z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer In Focus Pages\par \b \uc2 Stuck in the middle - but with who? Lib Dems tread a fine electoral line: In his party's spring conference, Nick Clegg must try to claim credit for coalition achievements while distancing himself from the Tories - and keeping lines open to Labour. By Toby Helm and Daniel Boffey\b0\par\par\uc2 973 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 28\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Addressing the Liberal Democrat spring conference in York yesterday, Nick Clegg extolled the virtues of further coalition government. Ruling again with the Tories, or for the first time with Labour, would not be an option on the ballot paper in 2015, he said. But a Labour-only government or a Conservative-only government would be "very bad indeed for the country".\par \par \uc2 One of Clegg's key messages these days is that his party should continue to be in a coalition, as it has been for almost four years, because it has all been a great success - and because the bigger parties cannot be trusted to run things on their own.\par \par \uc2 With the Lib Dems sharing power, things have gone well, he says: pupil premiums have been delivered for children; there is a new life without any tax for millions of low earners; and more bounty is to come soon for everyone as the income tax threshold looks set to be raised still higher in this month's budget - thanks to the Lib Dems.\par \par \uc2 But, with his party way down in the polls and facing the possible loss of all 12 of its seats in the European parliament, Clegg has at the same time to perform a more urgent task: that of quickly finding a way of differentiating the Lib Dems from the Tories, with whom they claim to have been so successful, by attacking them whenever he thinks he can.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, there was plenty of Tory-bashing on show in York. Chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander accused the Conservatives of trying brazenly to claim credit for the Lib Dems' successes on tax thresholds, while Vince Cable, the business secretary, said the Conservatives were "fanning the flames of prejudice" over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Clegg went for both Tories and Labour on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , saying that their language was "truly dispiriting".\par \par \uc2 As they try to portray themselves as distinct from, and not puppets of, the Tories, the Lib Dems flirt with a tactical danger, however. When lurching away from the right, they have to be careful not to creep too close to Labour because to do so would threaten their strategy of remaining, in theory at least, equidistant from the other two parties, one of which is certain to be the largest after the next election.\par \par \uc2 It is difficult being a Lib Dem these days. In pre-government times, when they were merely the protest party, they could say almost anything that would get them votes. Now, with coalition in play, it is all about positioning between two polar opposites while trying at the same time not to lose the party's own identity.\par \par \uc2 As well as knocking the Tories, they go for Labour and for Ukip. Clegg's forthcoming debates with Nigel Farage on the EU will give him a chance to position the Lib Dems as the most pro-European party, a message that will resonate with core backers. Again, this is about definition - so much more difficult as the smaller party in coalition than when powerless but independent.\par \par \uc2 In essence, what Lib Dems are saying is that only they can save the nation from unalloyed Tory or Labour government, and that - given the ills of the other parties - coalition is actually the best option.\par \par \uc2 Senior figures say that when analysed in detail, the argument is sound because we live in an imperfect world and disagreement can be creative. But by positioning themselves as the safeguards of everything decent, the Liberal Democrats place themselves on a moral pedestal that many would say ill befits the party now, given their record for going back on their word on tuition fees and the post-election VAT rise, and because of the way they have always campaigned in every election to date.\par \par \uc2 The difficult path that Lib Dems have to tread these days is neatly encapsulated in a document given to the Observer this weekend by rebel Lib Dem MPs, peers and council leaders from the north of England, angry about a lack of investment in their constituencies. It praises the coalition yet tries to damn the Tories.\par \par \uc2 "Jobs in the private sector are being created," they applaud, only to add: "However in the north-east the loss of public sector employment almost cancels out private sector jobs growth, the public sector jobs being better remunerated".\par \par \uc2 The document exemplifies the difficulty of criticising the government, in particular the Tory side, in an attempt to reap the dividends on northern doorsteps, while trying to grab some credit from the last four years.\par \par \uc2 Talking to the Observer yesterday, Alistair Carmichael, Scottish secretary and former chief whip, recognised that some might see a difficulty in attacking the excesses of Labour and the Tories while also making the case for a coalition in which one of those two evils necessarily must play a part - and the larger part.\par \par \uc2 Ingeniously, he said that all governments were coalitions of interests, and that where the antagonists were different parties in coalition, the divergences at least provoked debates rather than internecine warfare; better, for example, than Labour under Tony Blair and \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 . "There was a coalition of sorts when Blair and Brown were in government," he said. "It is a more honest coalition when there are two parties. It is a better way of governing."\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Looking both ways: Nick Clegg's pitch to voters at the election is likely to be that coalition with either party is preferable to unalloyed Labour or Conservative government.

\par\par \uc2 Observer Home News Pages\par \b \uc2 Leading Ukip members 'backed pact with BNP': Proposal was canvassed among party's NEC, according to new book\b0\par\par\uc2 by Daniel Boffey Policy Editor   \par \uc2 751 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A new book has revealed that Ukip considered forming a pact with the BNP five years ago, with two members of the party's national executive committee at the time in favour of the idea.\par \par \uc2 In 2008 Nigel Farage acknowledged that the BNP had proposed a deal for the European elections the following year, but insisted it had been unanimously rejected. Farage told reporters then: "I'm simply amazed that the BNP thought we would even consider such a thing."\par \par \uc2 Now the new book - Revolt on the Right, the most definitive account yet of the Ukip movement - reveals that the BNP's proposal was canvassed among 17 members of the party's NEC. Two members supported the proposal .\par \par \uc2 Farage, who said he had been against a pact, told the authors: "There were a lot of people saying to me at that time: 'You've got to do a deal with them.' I even had Tory MEPs saying to me, 'Nigel, you've got to do a deal with these people.' We were being beaten by them regularly in local elections. So there was huge pressure on me. The nature of the deal was the BNP would stand in some regions in the European elections in the north, and Ukip would stand in the south, and that would be the electoral pact, we wouldn't oppose each other."\par \par \uc2 The political predicament of Ukip in 2008 contrasts with its potential today, the authors say. In the book, published this week, they say the party has emerged from the crash with the potential to attract a third of the electorate.\par \par \uc2 Around 30% of voters are now believed to be both Eurosceptic and opposed to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , or Eurosceptic and politically dissatisfied, the defining themes for Ukip. Such sentiments are continuing to grow in strength among the electorate, according to the authors, who draw on the biggest pool of data so far amassed on the political movement.\par \par \uc2 The book provides evidence of the share of voters holding Eurosceptic views and at least one other radical right belief being up by around five to seven percentage points since 2008.\par \par \uc2 Ukip is widely recognised as not having a credible manifesto and has faced serious questions about the calibre of its MEPs, the authors note.\par \par \uc2 This weekend, the party was dogged by claims that it had misused EU funds in paying staff working in the UK. Yet Dr Matthew Goodwin, from \uc2 Nottingham University\uc2 , and Dr Robert Ford, of \uc2 Manchester University\uc2 , say that the "army of potential supporters for Ukip is growing in size" and is being aided by continued anger at Labour's record in power and disaffection with the Tory leader.\par \par \uc2 They argue that Farage and Ukip face huge challenges in the first-past-the-post electoral system and in the party's continued unpopularity among women, ethnic minorities, graduates and the young.\par \par \uc2 However, Ukip is now the favoured electoral option among those who strongly disapprove of the EU - 20% of all British voters.\par \par \uc2 Over the past three years, the party has also performed better than Labour among older, working-class and financially struggling voters. The party is using tactics similar to those once deployed by the Lib Dems, the authors say, in that they seek to deepen their vote in particular areas by getting into local councils and building strongholds.\par \par \uc2 It is claimed that, of the five constituencies where Ukip stands its best chance of general election success, four are Labour seats (Great Grimsby, Plymouth Moor View, Ashfield, Walsall North) and one is Tory (Waveney).\par \par \uc2 Farage, the academics claim, is fusing three issues to make a coherent message. The authors write: "Farage's party now encourages voters to say 'no' three times: no to the Eurocrats in Brussels and Strasbourg; no to the politicians in Westminster; and no to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "This is not a grand ideological vision - there is no 'Farageism' - but it is a coherent and highly effective message."\par \par \uc2 They add: "Ukip is not a second home for disgruntled Tories in the shires; it is a first home for disaffected working-class Britons of all political backgrounds who have lost faith in a political system that ceased to represent them long ago."\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage said in 2008 that the proposal for a Ukip-BNP deal had been unanimously rejected, but a detailed book published this week claims otherwise.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140308ea3900033\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 T\par \par \uc2 he inevitable victory of the Scottish independence campaign and the subsequent collapse of the Labour vote in the sorry remnants of the UK will see the next election won by a coalition of The Ukip and The Conservative party. Then the Bullingdon boys' lack of appeal to the common man will eventually leave the country entirely crushed by The Ukip's steel-capped Hush Puppy, as a pipe and cardigan version of The Golden Dawn gradually reshapes society in its own image, smothering dissent under an enormous tartan travel rug of hate.\par \par \uc2 But whether one is a supporter of The Ukip's position on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  or not, at least it is easy to grasp. The Ukip dislikes \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  even more than it loves smoking in pubs. But I was born here so I'm all right. What concerns me, as a professional creative, is the apparent incoherence of the anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  party's arts policy, as this will have a direct effect on my own quality of life, financial future and access to touring theatre productions should I chose to leave London and live in a region.\par \par \uc2 The closing night's entertainment at The Ukip's conference, it transpired last week, took the form of a 45-minute routine by a comedian called Paul Eastwood, who did funny Asian accents, performed a traditional Midlands folk song which turned out to be an impression of a Muslim prayer call, and told three Asian women in the room that they looked a little bit lost. It sounds like any Christmas Day in our family in the 70s.\par \par \uc2 But without having attended The Ukip's party we can't be sure if Eastwood's act was an ironic parody of a pre-PC standup, whether the supposedly offensive material was daringly contrasted and contextualised by material from a more liberal and perhaps pro-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  or anti-white perspective, or whether Eastwood was so beloved by the entire crowd, perhaps full of people of many different cultures, that his interaction with the three Asian ladies had more of the flavour of gentle tickling from a drunk and over-friendly Christmas uncle, than of outright racial provocation.\par \par \uc2 But what's interesting, for anyone considering working as an artist under the forthcoming Ukip government, or reading or seeing anything interesting ever again should The Ukip be elected, is the response of the party's leader, Nigel Farage, whose simple statement on the Eastwood incident swiftly and definitively unraveled decades of anxieties about The Political Correctness Gone Mad: "Enough is enough," declared Farage. "Let people tell their jokes! If what they say is inappropriate they won't earn a living because they won't get booked again." Pure. Simple. Classic. It's the kind of straight-talking, no-nonsense approach that has already endeared Farage to millions of nuance-resistant voters nationwide.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, Farage's definitive statement on ethics and taste in art, defining culture purely in terms of its market value, was compromised this week by the contradictory actions of his deputy leader, Paul Nuttalls. Nuttalls has been trying to prevent the gay comedy singing duo Jonny and the Baptists from completing the 17 dates of their current Stop Ukip Tour. The duo have the political edge of 80s alternative comedy but Jonny Donahoe has a pop soul voice to win X Factor. We took my sister-in-law to see them in Edinburgh and she loved it. That said, they're not stadium sized, and their 17 dates are mainly in 150-seater rooms. The idea that a tour of this size, performed by two men and one guitar, could "stop Ukip" is surely part of what makes it funny to call it The Stop Ukip Tour\par \par \uc2 The Ukip's own press release on The Stop Ukip Tour is one of those strange press releases that describe the actions of the people responsible for issuing the press release as if they were actual news, with an independent life beyond the press release they have been written about in by themselves. It begins thus: "The Arts Council has come under fire for wasting public money on a political satire show due to start touring in the north west." But it hasn't. Because it didn't. It has only come under fire in this press release.\par \par \uc2 The Stop Ukip show itself has received no funding. Six of the 17 venues on the Baptists' tour receive no funding. The others perhaps have a contribution to running costs from a local authority, and Arts Council money. When I tour council-funded venues I am often surprised that they host people such as Roy Chubby Brown, Jim Davidson, hosts of dubious mediums, and Jon "Gaunty" Gaunt, who no doubt offend the sensibilities of arts administrators who learned their craft at polytechnics during the PC era of the 80s and 90s. But council-funded venues have complex briefs to balance populist, profit-making performances with things that tick aspirational arts boxes. Maybe Paul Nuttalls knows this, and deliberately issued one of those misleading statements, like Gove's one about teachers using the Mr Men to tell kids about Nazism, hoping it can cause maximum damage before it is discredited.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip's press release concludes, its doublespeak undimmed; "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and Ukip is very much the party of free speech but I. . . have written to the Arts Council about this. . . distasteful satire." Nuttalls's boss, Farage, meanwhile, sees the demand of the market as the only arbiter of taste, and does not believe judgments about the value of a performance can be substantiated above and beyond a simple measurement of its popularity.\par \par \uc2 Trying to shut down theatre productions, like burning books, always looks bad, I think. But saying anything is fine if it sells well seems philistine. To be fair to The Ukip, they are learning on the job, and formulating a coherent arts policy was never high on their agenda, which is concerned mainly with deterring foreigners. Even the Tories struggled to define the purpose and value of culture, with Maria Miller, the culture secretary, initially assessing it in purely commercial terms, even as Michael Gove insisted Middlemarch was inherently better than Twilight, despite the latter's vast commercial success in the free market. Given that these two intellectual titans struggled to find a workable definition of the value and purpose of culture, what hope is their for The Ukip? Well, should they need a culture secretary, The Ukip need look no further than the beloved mainstay of British entertainment who announced his intention of joining the party this week - Jethro. And Jethro says, "Bull'cks to Europe!"\par \par \uc2 Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle is on BBC2 at 10pm on Saturdays, except in Wales, where it appears randomly. He appears in John Cage's Indeterminacy, as part of the Arts Council-supported Usurp Chance tour, at Derby Chocolate Factory, next Saturday, 15 March.\par \par \uc2 David Mitchell is away\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140308ea390007b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw337\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5055\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Comment\par \b \uc2 The Camerons\u8217\'20\'19 nanny isn\u8217\'20\'19t the scandal here ...\b0\par\par\uc2 Joan Smith   \par \uc2 523 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 Independent On Sunday\par \uc2 INDOS\par \uc2 1ST\par 38,39\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Comment\par \par \uc2 I can\u8217\'20\'19t say I care much whether David and \uc2 Samantha Cameron\uc2  employ a nanny. Gina Lima has been with the couple for several years, arriving when they needed help with their disabled son, Ivan, and staying on after he died in 2009. The length of time she\u8217\'20\'19s worked for the family suggests they have a good relationship, and I\u8217\'20\'19d be astonished if she wasn\u8217\'20\'19t paid properly or given sufficient time off.\par \par \uc2 There is a scandal about domestic workers in this country but the case of the Camerons\u8217\'20\'19 nanny isn\u8217\'20\'19t it. Lima, who is from Nepal but became a British citizen in 2010, apparently joined the family via an organisation called Kalayaan, which helps migrant workers escape abusive employers. It\u8217\'20\'19s based in Notting Hill, where the Prime Minister has his London home, and its website describes the exploitation \u8211\'20\'13 physical, psychological and sexual abuse, low pay and long hours \u8211\'20\'13 suffered by many workers.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m sure Lima is finding public discussion of her circumstances uncomfortable but she isn\u8217\'20\'19t the only domestic worker \u8211\'20\'13 nor are the Camerons the only employers \u8211\'20\'13 to come under scrutiny. Nick Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s discomfort with the subject was evident on his LBC phone-in. \u8220\'20\'1CI have a lady who has a Belgian passport who helps us,\u8221\'20\'1D he observed awkwardly. Two more ministers were dragged in yesterday: it was \u8220\'20\'1Crevealed\u8221\'20\'1D that the Home Secretary, Theresa May, has a Brazilian cleaner who now has British citizenship, while the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, employs a Portuguese cleaner.\par \par \uc2 As my colleague John Rentoul notes on page 38, the current row was sparked by a sentence in a speech by the new \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, James Brokenshire. But it\u8217\'20\'19s a ritual that plays out periodically on both sides of the Atlantic, targeting not just politicians who have unknowingly employed an illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  (as Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s predecessor, Mark Harper, did) but those who have hired foreigners perfectly legally. There isn\u8217\'20\'19t much public sympathy for either category, but that\u8217\'20\'19s because the whole subject of domestic work is so beset by prejudices about class, race and gender.\par \par \uc2 People who work in offices cleaned by minimum-wage migrants sneer at the Camerons or the Cleggs. The fact that most of this labour is done late at night means we don\u8217\'20\'19t think much about the people who do it \u8211\'20\'13 or their working conditions. I suspect Alexander\u8217\'20\'19s cleaner is treated better than most, but who cares when there\u8217\'20\'19s an opportunity for political point-scoring?\par \par \uc2 What\u8217\'20\'19s telling about these controversies is the outcome. A politician may be embarrassed, but it\u8217\'20\'19s the worker who risks most. In 2009, Labour\u8217\'20\'19s attorney general was revealed to have employed an illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  from Tonga as housekeeper. Lady Scotland, who earned more than \u163\'00\'A3100,000 a year, was fined \u163\'00\'A35,000 for failing to keep copies of relevant documents. Loloahi Tapui, who was paid the minimum wage of just over \u163\'00\'A36 per hour, was given eight months in prison and sent back to Tonga.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @polblonde\par \par \uc2 Politicalblonde.com\par \par \uc2 Document INDOS00020140309ea390002x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw337\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5055\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Comment\par \par \uc2 Do you not feel just a little sorry for James Brokenshire? An otherwise blameless Conservative minister seemed to be sliding out a perfectly loose-looking Jenga block from the tower, when down the whole thing came.\par \par \uc2 He had been the lucky beneficiary of someone else's mistake last month. Mark Harper, the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, had had one of those moments with which most of us are familiar - not the specifics, but the general. Those documents confirming the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  status of his cleaner: he knew he had put them somewhere. He should have checked them when he got the job but didn't get round to it until, oh dear, it turned out she wasn't allowed to work in this country.\par \par \uc2 He had to resign, and Brokenshire moved up a step in the Home Office. So, when Brokenshire turned up last week at the think tank that sounds like an aftershave, Demos, to deliver his first speech in his new brief, as aspersions flew over a "suppressed" government report on the effects of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , it seemed that it might be worth paying attention.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, it was an interesting speech. The structure was peculiar because a section attacking Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Business Secretary, had been pasted into a more conventional speech attacking the previous Labour government. Perhaps Theresa May, the Home Secretary, had thought to use Brokenshire's debut to respond to Cable's crowing over her failure to get net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  down. Cable, a balding man who is scrapping with Tim Farron over the comb of the succession to Nick Clegg, had welcomed the figures as "good news" - because they showed that our economy was growing.\par \par \uc2 Brokenshire said this was "simply incorrect", in a section of the speech that had presumably not been cleared with his Lib Dem partners. It was not good news for "the ordinary, hard-working people of this country", he said. It was good news only for "employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour, or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services". That was the moment the tower began to fall. The "wealthy metropolitan elite" such as his predecessor, who employed a cleaner from Colombia, and the Prime Minister, who employed a nanny from Nepal.\par \par \uc2 Suddenly, the offices of the Parliamentary press, usually quiet on a Friday, hummed with activity as every last bag-carrier to HM Government was interrogated about the names and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  status of anyone who had so much as looked at a pipe in their home over the past seven years and sucked their teeth at the quality of the work that had been done on it before.\par \par \uc2 Suffice to say that Brokenshire's name was mud. Rachel Johnson, sister of Boris, commented on what a good name it was for a Tory minister who blamed \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on the middle classes. Actually, he should have counted his blessings. Such was the hullabaloo over that single sentence that the hopeless arguments in the rest of the speech about the benefits and disbenefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , and why Labour was to blame for the latter, disappeared from view.\par \par \uc2 By chance, the BBC helped to expose the weakness of Brokenshire's speech when it took its Question Time claptrap to Barking, a part of east London most affected by \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , where Rachel Reeves, Labour new, clashed with Michael Heseltine, Tory old.\par \par \uc2 Reeves seemed to say that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was a bad thing with some good points, while Lord Heseltine seemed to say the opposite. Reeves said "we can't roll back the clock" and undo the "mistake" (Ed Miliband's word) made by the Labour government, of allowing free movement of Poles, Czechs and Hungarians in 2004, and she made the "nothing to do with me" point that she had not been elected until 2010. It is also true that Heseltine accused her of "arrant hypocrisy" (as opposed to the more usual "breathtaking" or "rank" kinds) because it was still her party's government that made that decision in 2004. But there his argument collapsed, because, although he posed as a valiant welcomer of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , he too accepted that the failure to impose transitional controls in 2004 had been a mistake.\par \par \uc2 That is, actually, where the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate has got to. For all Heseltine and Brokenshire's attempts to blame the last Labour government, everyone is now agreed that transitional controls should have been imposed to slow down the rate of change. Everyone, that is, with the possible exception of Cable. Nor, apart from him, do the leaders of all three main parties disagree about current policy. All three want to keep a tight lid on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from countries outside the EU; all three know there is little they can do about free movement within the EU; so all three posture a bit on small measures such as denying social security benefits to people from other EU countries until they have been here for a while.\par \par \uc2 And Brokenshire tried to pretend that, although net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is going up when the Tories said it would go down, this is Labour's fault for ... having joined the \uc2 European Union\uc2  in 1973. Oh.\par \par \uc2 Yes, I feel a bit sorry for him.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @JohnRentoul\par \par \uc2 Document INDOS00020140309ea390002y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 UK Politics\par \b \uc2 Nick Clegg to launch veiled attack on Nigel Farage's 'bile'; Politics of blame has found an acceptable face, Lib Dem leader will warn in conference speech\b0\par\par\uc2 Mark Leftly   \par \uc2 714 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 00:00\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg will launch a thinly veiled attack on Ukip leader Nigel Farage today, warning that the \u8220\'20\'1Cbile" and \u8220\'20\'1Canger" of nationalistic extremism is on the march across Europe.\par \par \uc2 The deputy prime minister will tell the Liberal Democrat spring conference in York that \u8220\'20\'1Can ungenerous, backwards looking politics has emerged in Britain". The beer-loving Mr Farage has led Ukip out of obscurity and could even win May's European elections.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub".\par \par \uc2 The two party leaders face each other in a television debate over EU membership next month, with the Lib Dems using the conference to define the party's pro-European stance against Ukip's determination to leave the bloc. Mr Clegg claims he is \u8220\'20\'1Cdrawing a line in the sand" before nationalist parties gain ground politically in the UK, as they have in France, Slovakia, Hungary and Greece.\par \par \uc2 This is one of the first big steps Mr Clegg has taken to ensure that the Lib Dems have a distinct identity ahead of next year's general election after nearly four bruising years of Conservative coalition government.\par \par \uc2 The deputy prime minister has faced criticism from within his own party membership for the concessions the Lib Dems had to make in order to gain power, most infamously ditching a pledge to scrap university tuition fees.\par \par \uc2 Stressing that the UK must remain part of the EU to protect jobs, tackle climate change, and foster cross border co-operation in policing is fraught with electoral danger. A leading party campaigner even warned Mr Clegg at an event yesterday that talking about the EU does not work \u8220\'20\'1Con the doorstep".\par \par \uc2 According to some forecasts, the Lib Dems could lose all 12 of their MEPs in the European poll, but Mr Clegg vowed: \u8220\'20\'1CForget the lazy assumption that, in the court of public opinion, the Eurosceptics will automatically win want jobs... Because there are plenty of people out there who don't want anger. They don't want bile. They want jobs."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg will not name-check any of the other parties in the speech, as he looks to focus on making the Liberal Democrats distinctive from Labour and the Conservatives.\par \par \uc2 In a question and answer session with conference delegates yesterday, Mr Clegg showed his frustration that the Conservatives have largely gained the credit for the Coalition's most successful policies, while the Lib Dems have been battered in the opinion polls.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems have successfully pushed through a rise of the point that people start paying income tax to \u163\'00\'A310,000 from this year. The party has been pushing the Conservatives to agree to a further \u163\'00\'A3500 increase - effectively a \u163\'00\'A31bn tax cut - while First secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said yesterday that another hike to \u163\'00\'A312,500 would be the party's price for forming another Coalition in 2015.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe should be proud of the fact that we're helping people on low and middle incomes," said Mr Clegg. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is something that is finally being associated with us. People don't believe the Conservatives when they say that they wanted the allowance [raised] all along."\par \par \uc2 At a fringe event, Mr Alexander added that the increase to \u163\'00\'A310,000 and more \u8220\'20\'1Cstrengthens the Labour market" and makes a \u8220\'20\'1Chuge difference to millions and millions of people". He warned, though, that the party needed to \u8220\'20\'1Cwork very hard to make sure that the Liberal Democrats get a fair share of the credit for the economic recovery".\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg also accused Labour of \u8220\'20\'1Carrogance" yesterday, in particular attacking front-bench for an \u8220\'20\'1Cassumption that basically Government will fall into their laps".\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives were accused of \u8220\'20\'1Cnot standing up for business", after \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister James Brokenshire appeared to criticise employers for taking on foreign labour.\par \par \uc2 He also assured party members that he still wants to be Prime Minister, despite all the talk of potentially again being Coalition as the smaller party after the 2015 election.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140309ea39000mi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 International Women's Day: Where do we go next on the road to global equality? Women have a long way to go in the worldwide battle against gender imbalance, as well as the violence and sexual abuse they suffer. Sarah Morrison reports on the persistent problems that affect half the population\b0\par\par\uc2 Sarah Morrison   \par \uc2 1,934 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 00:00\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It is the day after the night before. Plays were performed, films broadcast, speeches given and thousands marched on the capital's streets to mark International Women's Day yesterday. But what, if anything, is next?\par \par \uc2 Global equality does not seem likely. One in three women worldwide has experienced violence or sexual abuse; 140 million women and girls globally have been subjected to female genital mutilation; 215 million women cannot access contraception; about 14 million young girls will be married this year.\par \par \uc2 Yet campaigners around the world have not given up. With 364 days left until the next landmark, The Independent on Sunday asked seven women, from politicians to activists and actors, what they thought were the biggest issues facing women this year.\par \par \uc2 Defending the Human Rights Act\par \par \uc2 Shami Chakrabarti; Director of Liberty\par \par \uc2 "Find me a sphere of life untainted by gender inequality and I'll be impressed \u8211\'20\'13 it's probably the biggest global injustice we face. This year an election looms, but already the gloves are off and anti-human rights rhetoric abounds. Our Human Rights Act protects women from abuses ranging from sexual assault to slavery, and we need to entrench such protections, not scrap them. If we don't all step up and fight for the Act this year, we may well lose it. And women will be among the hardest hit."\par \par \uc2 Sexual Violence in Conflict\par \par \uc2 Jemima Khan; Writer and Unicef ambassador\par \par \uc2 "The long-term effect of rape and abuse can be catastrophic both physically and emotionally. A recent report by the UN Secretary-General on sexual violence in conflict gives a sense of the horrifying scale of the problem \u8211\'20\'13 reporting on sexual violence from Somalia to South Sudan to Syria. In the Democratic Republic of Congo alone, approximately 1,100 rapes are reported every month, with an average of 36 women and girls raped every day. The Foreign Secretary [William Hague] has played a leading role in focusing international attention on sexual violence in conflict. We now want to see that international political will translated into practical action at the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict in London in June. The \uc2 UK Government\uc2  must ensure that global leaders commit to concrete measures to protect not only women but also children. We want child survivors of violence to have access to justice \u8211\'20\'13 to feel safe to come forward and to hold their abusers to account. The Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict is an unprecedented opportunity for change."\par \par \uc2 Britain's young\par \par \uc2 Laura Bates; Founder of the Everyday Sexism Project\par \par \uc2 "From young women raising their voices to fight against female genital mutilation to students who are rebelling against a culture of misogyny at UK universities, we are seeing a real revolution as a whole new generation of young women is standing shoulder to shoulder alongside more seasoned feminists to stamp out sexism and gender imbalance, once and for all. Issues that were once dismissed and brushed under the carpet are no longer being ignored, and young people are taking the fight to a new frontier using social media to organise and campaign."\par \par \uc2 Honour-based abuse\par \par \uc2 Jasvinder Sanghera; Founder of Karma Nirvana\par \par \uc2 "Honour-based abuse is what underlines all abuse: FGM, forced marriage and all the other oppressive practices. It's committing crimes in the name of so-called honour \u8211\'20\'13 to protect a family's reputation. You understand you have the power to bring shame and dishonour to your family. From eight years old, I understood I wasn't allowed to cut my hair, or sit in the presence of boys. I had to dress modestly and not take part in social activities that my peers took part in, like going to the school disco or going swimming. I was told it was dishonourable. Families that operate under the honour system are self-policing. You can be significantly harmed, or whipped off to Pakistan to marry somebody. They deal with the victims as they want and the world doesn't see it. We have come a long way when it comes to forced marriage: we have a forced marriage unit, and soon it will be a criminal offence. But where there's forced marriage, there's always honour-based abuse. I'd like the Government to give us a definition of what it is. I'd like to see every police force in the UK be inspected in how they deal with it and get trained."\par \par \uc2 Detention of female asylum-seekers\par \par \uc2 Juliet Stevenson; Actress\par \par \uc2 "It's a brutal, shameful aspect of government practice. For a long time, I've been deeply concerned about the issue of detaining people who come to this country seeking sanctuary. We need to remind everybody that this is a legal right. Many come from an experience of extreme brutality, almost always rape and very often having had to leave children behind. They had to escape through extremely dangerous circumstances and yet, almost all of these women's experiences in this country are as bad and brutalising as the experience from which they fled. It's shocking to see how they're treated in Yarl's Wood [detention centre] when you think they haven't committed any crime. The Home Office is making a lot of mistakes; it has a culture of refusal \u8211\'20\'13 that's its default position. There's a culture of fear and loathing. All three parties are vying for electoral popularity, [but] it's urgent to separate the asylum question from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ; they're very different. We need to reinvest in legal aid, re-educate the Home Office and make sure these issues are separate. It's an inhuman system."\par \par \uc2 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)\par \par \uc2 Fahima Hashim; Director of Salmmah Women's Resource Centre in Sudan\par \par \uc2 "FGM takes away the dignity of a woman as a sexual being. We had a proposed law to criminalise it [in Sudan] but the article has been removed. I produced advocacy materials defining danger and consequences of FGM to a woman and gave it to the men of my family to read. On the eve of the day my cousin was going to do it to his daughters, he changed his mind. Those women are now young mothers with young ones of their own. FGM remains a big issue, but so is sexual harassment, rape and the way it's dealt with in society. There are violations everywhere; crimes against women and humanity. Women are lashed here for what they wear, or for adultery. Women are not given the space to exert themselves. They're degraded and aren't part of society or an agent of change. We need to provide information about sexuality and [enable] women to look at themselves as sexual beings. I'm still hopeful. All the beautiful women in my country, including my daughter and niece, deserve to live in dignity."\par \par \uc2 Childcare\par \par \uc2 Gloria De Piero; Shadow Women and Equalities minister\par \par \uc2 "Listening to women across every part of the country, the one thing that comes up more than anything is childcare. Where is the progress when the cost of even part-time childcare is now more than a mortgage, and women still feel they have to choose between their career and their family? That's why we need to expand free childcare for three- and four-year-olds and ensure access to breakfast and after-school clubs, helping women and their families."\par \par \uc2 London's annual Million Women Rise march sees thousands call for end to violence\par \par \uc2 Thousands of women marched through the streets of central London yesterday calling for an end to violence against women. Crowds walked down Oxford Street and gathered in Trafalgar Square to hear music and speeches from activists.\par \par \uc2 The seventh annual Million Women Rise march fell on International Women's Day, seeking to highlight all forms of female exploitation and abuse in the UK and around the world.\par \par \uc2 Myriad nationalities converged on a sunny afternoon, with demonstrators decked out in colourful outfits. Beating drums and dancing, they sang: "Power to the women. Women got the power. Sister can you hear us?"\par \par \uc2 Andrea Johnstone, 50, a charity worker from Bournemouth, was marching in London for a third year. She said: "Women aren't here to be abused. That's not what we were put on the planet for." Student Phoebe Heptinstall, 18, who marched with her mother, voiced concerns about women in music videos portrayed as sex objects "as if their only worth were their tits and arse".\par \par \uc2 Demonstrators called on the Government to increase funding to female charities that look after victims of abuse and to overhaul the justice system to prosecute more male sex offenders. Other demonstrations and marches were held around the world, from Paris to Los Angeles to Sydney.\par \par \uc2 Alex Delmar-Morgan\par \par \uc2 How feminism can achieve its goal? It's child's play\par \par \uc2 Have you ever asked a six-year-old girl how feminism can achieve its goal? You should. The answer, it turns out, is quite simple. "Boys and girls should all be treated equally," according to Lottie Goodchild. "Some places they are, but not others. To make it equal, you've got to pass the news on. Get lots of people involved to stop this."\par \par \uc2 The young feminist, who wants to be a doctor, vet and dentist (all at the same time) when she grows up, has already done her part. She spent yesterday afternoon discussing feminism and celebrating International Women's Day at the Women of the World (WOW) Festival in London. All her fellow debaters were under 10 years old.\par \par \uc2 Activist Malala Yousafzai, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and artist Grayson Perry, who are all scheduled to attend the festival this weekend, might have dominated the headlines, but it was at WOW's over-subscribed Under 10s Corner \u8211\'20\'13 where 15 already thoughtful girls talked while seated on brightly coloured bean bags \u8211\'20\'13 that the big issues were discussed.\par \par \uc2 "Are boys and girls the same?" "What does feminism mean?" "What toys do you play with?" and "What is it like in your playground?" were just some of the questions asked by playwright and poet Caroline Bird, who facilitated the event.\par \par \uc2 She was stuck by the growing awareness about equal rights among young girls. "[In some ways] they are a lot more progressive than the adults around them," she said.\par \par \uc2 One girl said she had been stopped from playing with boys in her school playground. Another said she was allowed to play with boys, but was often treated differently because she was a girl. Another had been teased for being a feminist ("The boy said I must hate boys"). But it got really heated when they were asked about toys being marketed differently for boys and girls \u8211\'20\'13 did you know there are boy and girl Nerf guns?\par \par \uc2 On one point there was unanimous agreement: kids should have their say. "You shouldn't have to be a certain age to care about feminism, because it's something that's wrong in the world," said eight-year-old Ella Kiely. Esme Leaman-Hill, eight, agreed. "It isn't fair for men to be better than women and to get dreams while women cook and clean."\par \par \uc2 Becky Goodchild, seven, summed it up: "They should all be good to each other. They're both equal."\par \par \uc2 Sarah Morrison\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140309ea39000n8\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Louise Mensch\par \b \uc2 Schoolgirl Rachel says folks owe her... but it\u8217\'20\'19s the other way round; LOTS of tweets on last week\u8217\'20\'19s column about feckless, entitled British kids \u8211\'20\'13 but we\u8217\'20\'19re not the only ones.\b0\par\par\uc2 By LOUISE MENSCH, Sun Columnist   \par \uc2 1,347 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 00:47\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd.

But Rachel wasn\u8217\'20\'19t interested in doing as her parents told her.\par \par \uc2 She stormed from their home and then she SUED them, demanding $650 (\u163\'00\'A3390) in weekly child support.\par \par \uc2 Talk about entitled. This is one of today\u8217\'20\'19s generation of teens who think their parents owe them \u8212\'20\'14 and not the other way around.\par \par \uc2 The Catholic school regrettably supported Rachel. Despite the fact she had several recorded instances of drinking, had been stripped of her cheerleading captaincy and fired from school ministry, they called Children\u8217\'20\'19s Services, the US welfare department.\par \par \uc2 Yet the professionals weren\u8217\'20\'19t so easily fooled \u8212\'20\'14 a social worker visited the Cannings\u8217\'20\'19 home and concluded Rachel was \u8220\'20\'1Cspoiled".

They have offered her a welcome home whenever she can agree to rules.\par \par \uc2 It has been revealed that John Inglesino threw alcoholic parties for Rachel and her friends from the age of 15.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CRachel\u8217\'20\'19s first time drinking alcohol was at the Inglesino house," said her parents in a court document. \u8220\'20\'1CShe was angry because we would not host an alcoholic party... the Inglesinos have been a tremendous hindrance in family healing."\par \par \uc2 Rachel\u8217\'20\'19s use of her school uniform fooled no one \u8212\'20\'14 and America, where parents break the bank to send their kids to college, is now gripped in a debate over how far teens should go. She has more court dates but the judge\u8217\'20\'19s comments don\u8217\'20\'19t leave her with much hope.\par \par \uc2 The 18-year-old later bitched on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  that if her parents don\u8217\'20\'19t stump up the six figures they\u8217\'20\'19ve saved, she may have to join the \uc2 US Army\uc2  to qualify for free college tuition.\par \par \uc2 Rachel, it would be great if you joined the military.\par \par \uc2 A Sgt Major could do you a power of good.\par \par \uc2 Now drop and give me 50.\par \par \uc2 Dee rap taking the mick\par \par \uc2 Deidre Kelly, aka White Dee\par \par \uc2 I HATE to return to White Dee yet again but the \u8220\'20\'1Cdepressed" Benefits Street star won\u8217\'20\'19t leave us alone, either.\par \par \uc2 She has now made a rap single.\par \par \uc2 Real name Deidre Kelly, she is just taking the mick.\par \par \uc2 Her \u8220\'20\'1Cagents" protest she should still get her benefits because she hasn\u8217\'20\'19t cashed any money \u8211\'20\'13 and her frequent TV appearances are unpaid.\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s not the point.\par \par \uc2 The point is, paid or unpaid, Dee\u8217\'20\'19s proving herself capable of work \u8211\'20\'13 and plenty of it.\par \par \uc2 Channel 4\u8217\'20\'19s Benefits Street was more than just the spectacle of a bunch of chancers ripping off the rest of us. It exposed the evils of a welfare system that subsidises the lazy.\par \par \uc2 I can\u8217\'20\'19t say if White Dee is genuinely depressed or not \u8211\'20\'13 this is the basis of her benefits claim. But I can definitely say she isn\u8217\'20\'19t too depressed to work. That\u8217\'20\'19s what she\u8217\'20\'19s doing, right now, right this minute \u8211\'20\'13 working for her own PR.\par \par \uc2 Dee\u8217\'20\'19s rap effort is called Your To Blame \u8211\'20\'13 bad English and all.\par \par \uc2 But she\u8217\'20\'19s right.\par \par \uc2 If we don\u8217\'20\'19t stop her benefits, we\u8217\'20\'19re condoning this.\par \par \uc2 Time for her local Job Centre to take a hard look. Dee\u8217\'20\'19s benefited from the rest of us quite enough.\par \par \uc2 Hillary\u8217\'20\'19s painful poll exit Former First Lady \uc2 Hillary Clinton\par \par \uc2 READY for Hillary in 2016? Yes, so was I. The former First Lady has more than proved she deserves the top spot herself.\par \par \uc2 After all, she\u8217\'20\'19s been a Senator from my home state of New York and a highly effective Secretary of State.\par \par \uc2 Compare her performance to election loser John Kerry \u8211\'20\'13 Russia\u8217\'20\'19s double triumph in Syria and Crimea comes on Kerry\u8217\'20\'19s watch.\par \par \uc2 Governor \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 , of New Jersey, was regarded as the Republican\u8217\'20\'19s only hope of winning the next presidential contest. But after his Bridgegate scandal, party insiders have concluded he\u8217\'20\'19s damaged goods.\par \par \uc2 Normally after eight years of Democrat rule, you\u8217\'20\'19d expect a change at the top. This is even more true now president \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  is deeply unpopular.\par \par \uc2 But Hillary has a trump card \u8211\'20\'13 she\u8217\'20\'19s a woman. And American women are desperate to see one of their own in the White House. Her nomination seems so certain that nobody else is even talking about running \u8211\'20\'13 except national joke VP Joe Biden.\par \par \uc2 The 2016 story seemed to have already been written \u8211\'20\'13 \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  cruises to the Democratic nomination and then back to the Oval Office \u8211\'20\'13 becoming the most powerful woman in history.\par \par \uc2 But bombshell news this week might be about to rip that narrative to pieces.\par \par \uc2 Multiple Washington sources are leaking to blogs and websites the rumour that Hillary isn\u8217\'20\'19t going to run after all. They say she has a brain tumour \u8211\'20\'13 or some other brain-related injury that will stop her.\par \par \uc2 This week political website the Daily Caller claimed Clinton\u8217\'20\'19s health was much worse than disclosed and respected GOP political consultant Roger Stone tweeted \u8220\'20\'1CHillary. Not running. Not well."\par \par \uc2 Hilary fainted on camera in 2012 after overworking herself and the resulting concussion led to a blood clot on her brain.\par \par \uc2 Her office admitted in December she\u8217\'20\'19d undergone an operation and the latest whispers suggest the brain problems have returned.\par \par \uc2 If Hillary doesn\u8217\'20\'19t run, the 2016 election will be wide open.\par \par \uc2 But losing America\u8217\'20\'19s Maggie Thatcher from politics at the pinnacle of her career would be far too heavy a price for women all over the world.\par \par \uc2 Check \u8216\'20\'18em, Nicki\par \par \uc2 Wet and wild Nicki Minaj\par \par \uc2 NEVER knowingly overdressed, Nicki Minaj has done it again.\par \par \uc2 Not content with posting pictures of herself in miniature bikinis and skin-tight leggings, the rap superstar has now put up a series of soapy snaps of herself in the shower \u8211\'20\'13 wearing not a stitch.\par \par \uc2 You can\u8217\'20\'19t actually see any nipples, Minaj prefers to tease her \u8220\'20\'1Cfans". But it\u8217\'20\'19s an incredible shame the Super Bass star can\u8217\'20\'19t let her talent do the talking.\par \par \uc2 If she wants to put those curves to some good use, Nicki could Instagram a few pics of herself Checking \u8217\'20\'19em for cancer \u8211\'20\'13 like The Sun is urging us all to do.\par \par \uc2 For once she\u8217\'20\'19d be behaving in the BREAST possible taste.\par \par \uc2 \u8211\'20\'13 SO the BBC was biased? You DO surprise me.\par \par \uc2 Turns out that a \u8220\'20\'1Csuppressed" report Newsnight talked about was released IN FULL \u8211\'20\'13 and it backs Tory claims that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  affects the working poor.\par \par \uc2 James Brokenshire, the new \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, is taking on Vince Cable on the issue. The Lib Dem Conference is about to start and Tories can\u8217\'20\'19t wait to hear Calamity Cable tell voters why we should have that open-door policy the yellows love so much.\par \par \uc2 Document THESUK0020140309ea390015u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 Editorial; Opinion, Leading articles\par \b \uc2 There's no shame in employing skilled migrants\b0\par\par\uc2 809 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph ESTABLISHED IN 1961\par \par \uc2 When Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, appeared on the Today programme yesterday, he was asked a simple question: did he employ anyone from another country? First, he said that, yes, the Treasury does indeed employ talented people from all over the world. But that was not what the interviewer wanted to know. The real issue was, does Mr Alexander personally employ anyone from another country? "We use a brilliant British childminder," he said, "and a Portuguese lady occasionally comes into clean our home." There is nothing wrong about that, Mr Alexander insisted. But the awkward tone of his answers suggests that employing someone from overseas has become a potential political embarrassment.\par \par \uc2 It has been "revealed" that Theresa May, the Home Secretary, uses a Brazilian cleaner. Nick Clegg confessed on radio: "I have a lady who has a Belgian passport who helps us." Even the Prime Minister has owned up to employing domestic staff from Nepal and Australia since entering Downing Street. The former was hired from a charity that helps \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  workers to escape from abusive bosses. None of this is illegal, none of this is unethical, none of this ought to cause shame. The only reason it is controversial is that James Brokenshire, the new Home Office minister, said last week that mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  works largely to the benefit of the "wealthy metropolitan elite". The losers are "manual and low-skilled workers who have to compete with an influx of people from poorer countries who are willing to work for less".\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire should have known that he was setting his party up for a fall when he made that remark. He had been appointed to replace an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister who was forced to resign after it was discovered that his foreign-born cleaner did not have all the right paperwork. Tories cannot talk too casually about the malign effects of the "wealthy metropolitan elite" because so many of the Conservative members of Cabinet can be counted among their number.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, the idea that employing foreign-born staff is an elitist thing to do is nonsense. Many middle-class Britons hire plumbers, cleaners or builders from overseas. Many businesses could not function without them. The contribution of these hard-working people to the economy is invaluable, and often their British employers are helping them to escape a life of poverty. A great number of those employers will also be Tory voters, and very surprised to discover that they have graduated to membership of the aristocracy just by having a Polish gardener visit them once a week.\par \par \uc2 Yet again, the Conservative Party has blundered into offending its own base by a foolish attempt to chase the zeitgeist. On this occasion, Mr Brokenshire's remarks are part of a "white van man" strategy to woo Labour's workingclass voters or those tempted by Ukip. The \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  issue is a legitimate one: there is evidence that mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  displaced some British workers during the recession. But populism of this variety is rarely helpful when it comes to forming coherent, sensible policy. It can mask some of the complexities of the issue. Nigel Farage has said that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has "jollified" Britain. More than that, it has enhanced our national culture and helped us to grow the economy. But it does have consequences. Labour promised us, when it opened our labour market up to Eastern Europe, that it would result in just a trickle of newcomers. Instead, millions poured in, placing new strains on already overstrained hospitals and schools. In other words, we do not need to stop \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . We need to control it better. That should be the substance of Tory policy.\par \par \uc2 Current policy is clearly not working. Mr Cameron pledged to reduce net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to the "tens of thousands" but figures for 2012-2013 show it rising to more than 200,000. As Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, wrote in this newspaper last Sunday, talking about "net migration" (those coming in balanced against those going out) obscures the raw data, the actual number entering the country; it is that figure which overloads public services. As Dr Fox put it: "There needs to be a clearer narrative on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , stressing not only the need to restrict numbers, but also to determine which individuals, with what skills, enter our country."\par \par \uc2 Getting the terms of the debate right is important. Otherwise, we end up with the sort of discussion about who employs whom, and from where, that Mr Alexander called "poisonous" in his anxious interview. \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  will be a dominant issue in the 2015 election, and voters will reward those who are straightforward about the statistics and offer serious proposals for better management of our borders. Tory class warfare will not work.\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140309ea3900068\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \b \uc2 IMMIGRATION\b0 \uc2  ROW\par \par \uc2 The Conservative \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, James Brokenshire, gave a speech in which he said that a "wealthy metropolitan elite" of middle-class households has helped to support mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to Britain by demanding cheap labour and services. Mr Brokenshire accused Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, of "asserting falsehoods" about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Mr Cable said that "bearing down on economic migration is a clear example of a restriction on trade" and it could hurt the UK economy.\par \par \uc2 TWITTER DIPLOMACY\par \par \uc2 As the crisis in Ukraine continued, Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  posted a photograph on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  showing him on the phone, with a tweet saying: "I've been speaking to @BarackObama about the situation in Ukraine. We are united in condemnation of Russia's actions." Mr Cameron had a welcome supporter at Prime Minister's Questions. His wife, Samantha, appeared in a VIP gallery. It was the second time she has attended PMQs.\par \par \uc2 PISTORIUS TRIAL\par \par \uc2 The start of the trial of the South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius gripped the world's media. Mr Pistorius's former girlfriend told the trial that he once fired his gun from his car sunroof after becoming angry with police. In the United States, a Californian businessman who lost $500,000 (\u163\'00\'A3299,000) at a Las Vegas casino, sued it for serving him drinks and lending him money while, he claimed, he was clearly intoxicated. Under Nevada law, casinos should not allow patrons who are visibly drunk to gamble.\par \par \uc2 TIM WIGMORE\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140309ea390006e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 NANNYGATE, \uc2 IMMIGRATION\uc2 ... AND WHY THE TORIES ARE AT WAR\b0\par\par\uc2 Iain Martin   \par \uc2 2,124 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 How did a ministerial speech about cheap foreign labour and its impact on Britain come to threaten party unity, asks Iain Martin\par \par \uc2 When Gita Lima decided that she wanted to become British, one of her bosses did what any good employer would do for a valued member of staff. They signed the papers. The application, made in 2010, was successful, and the Nepalese Ms Lima joined the swelling ranks of new British citizens. She is still working for the family as a nanny at one of central London's smartest addresses.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately for Ms Lima, the story doesn't end there. Her bosses are the Prime Minister and his wife, and the Government that \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  leads last week launched an attack on wealthy metropolitan types who have benefited from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  by employing foreign nannies and cleaners at the expense of indigenous labour. In his first major speech as \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, James Brokenshire claimed that it is "ordinary, hard-working people" who have suffered.\par \par \uc2 Within hours of Mr Brokenshire's comments, Mr Cameron's spokesman was being forced to answer questions about the prime ministerial nanny. Ms Lima was originally hired to care for the Camerons' disabled son, Ivan, after the family advertised with a charity that helps \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to escape abusive employers. A furious No 10 denied that \uc2 Samantha Cameron\uc2 's support had helped to speed her employee's application through the system. All procedures had been followed correctly, said a spokesman.\par \par \uc2 But inevitably, questions were then asked about other senior ministers and their domestic staff. Theresa May, the Home Secretary, confirmed that her cleaner was born in Brazil, and it emerged that Nick Clegg employs a Belgian. Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, grew flustered yesterday when pressed on the radio about his family's own domestic help. Britons, it appeared, were being told by the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister to do as ministers say, not as ministers do.\par \par \uc2 Senior Conservatives are still trying to work out how No 10 failed to anticipate the scrutiny when they were presented with a draft of Mr Brokenshire's speech by the Home Office last week. Why had the Government shot itself in the foot? A minister said: "The Cabinet is full of people who employ \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . For us to draw attention to this while trying to highlight concerns about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is not very smart."\par \par \uc2 It is only a few weeks since the last \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister had to quit, when it emerged that his cleaner was an illegal migrant. Mark Harper, until then seen as a rising star in the Tory firmament, had been an enthusiastic supporter of the Government's controversial "Go Home" vans, which featured large billboard advertisements telling illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to pack their bags. In the end, it was Mr Harper who had to leave. Now, Mr Brokenshire's career prospects have taken a knock.\par \par \uc2 His speech, and poor planning within government, certainly helped to create a situation in which Mr Cameron's family and a hard-working nanny - who paid Britain the ultimate compliment of becoming British - find themselves under intense scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 The row has also delighted Labour because it made the Government look shambolic, although for the most part, the Opposition has stayed quiet, with Ed Miliband adopting the old military principle of not interrupting an enemy when he is making a mistake.\par \par \uc2 Labour has also had \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  scandals of its own. When Baroness Scotland was Attorney General, in the previous government, she declined to resign after being fined \u163\'00\'A35,000 for employing a housekeeper who was a Tongan national with no right to be in the UK. The current crop of senior Labour figures also have a reason for keeping out of the row: just like theirTory rivals, many of them legitimately employ domestic staff who are \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Indeed, as the smoke clears from the Westminster battleground, the war over Mr Cameron's nanny is best seen in the context of the great national divide on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - between the metropolitans and those living in less affluent parts of middle Britain, with one side viewing \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as overwhelmingly positive for the economy, and the other very worried about the impact on employment, public services, housing and social cohesion.\par \par \uc2 So far apart are these two sides that the protagonists might as well be talking different languages. Metropolitan liberals cannot see why there should be a fuss about everyone having an Eastern European cleaner or getting a loft conversion carried out by Poles, while non-metropolitans marvel at the wholly false notion that everyone in Britain can afford a cleaner and a loft conversion.\par \par \uc2 The Tory plan - such as it was - rested on the hope that Mr Brokenshire's speech might resonate with the majority of voters, who tell pollsters that they are concerned about the side-effects of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . To stand a chance at the next general election, the Conservatives need to convince sufficient numbers of those voters that they are being listened to, particularly those who are thinking about defecting to Nigel Farage's Ukip. Mr Brokenshire's ill-fated speech - written with the backing of Theresa May, who is notoriously hands-on when one of her ministers is thinking about saying anything - had been designed to come across as a piece of straight-talking common sense.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at the think tank Demos, the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister said: "For too long, the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour, or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services, but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country."\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire's intervention provoked fierce criticism from business, with the head of the Institute of Directors so annoyed by what he saw as the anti-enterprise tone of the minister's remarks that he described the speech as "feeble and pathetic". Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Business Secretary, also condemned those who want to bear down on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Commentators then piled in, eager to deride Mr Brokenshire's alleged naivety.\par \par \uc2 It also looked to some critics as though the Conservatives had taken to attacking their own voters in the South East, where the fastexpanding economy has sucked in foreign labour in the shape of eager-to-please migrants, many prepared to work hard. In other prosperous pockets outside London, there has been a similar effect, although it is not as pronounced.\par \par \uc2 The migrants are not just working for Cabinet ministers (there are not enough to go round), and the affluent middle-class voters who employ these new arrivals, to help with child care or to fix a leaky sink, may not take kindly to being lectured to. In this way, the speech by Mr Brokenshire illustrated the extreme difficulty the Tories are having appealing to voters with entirely different experiences of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 However, the more basic problem for the Tory side of the Coalition is the reality that its \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy is falling apart as the general election nears.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron came to office promising to reduce annual \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to a figure in the tens of thousands. This aspiration is now doomed. Although the Government has managed to reduce the number of arrivals from outside the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , there has been a surge from within the EU as ambitious migrant workers from austerity-hit southern Europe head for the UK. Last month, the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  confirmed that net migration - the difference between the number arriving and leaving - had leapt to 212,000 in the past year.\par \par \uc2 Ministers realise, with horror, that there is nothing they can do about this, other than make speeches aimed at reassuring voters that they are on the case. Britain long ago signed away its right to restrict free movement of labour from other EU countries and, short of leaving the EU, any government is powerless. Even restricting benefits is not a useful tool, as the latest wave of arrivals seem intent on working and bettering themselves, which only prompts those who favour an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  free-for-all to say that they should be welcomed enthusiastically.\par \par \uc2 The latest influx has also revived the argument about whether or not \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  damages job prospects for those already living here. Last week, the Government was accused of suppressing a report that claimed to show that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has done no harm to employment. When it was rushed out, it became clear that the report actually claimed that while it made no difference in a period of strong economic growth, it did impact adversely on the lowest-paid during a recession. As the UK is just emerging from the worst slump in seven decades, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  will have had a recent impact.\par \par \uc2 In the Conservative Party, the deep divisions in the country are reflected in Parliament. The Cameroons - supporters of Mr Cameron - have tended to take a broadly positive view of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . One Cameroon said that while he did not want to get involved publicly in the row over the Brokenshire speech, he was "disappointed" by some of the rhetoric being used by the Tories as the Conservative leadership attempts to deal with the threat from Ukip.\par \par \uc2 And that view is not just restricted to enthusiastic supporters of the Prime Minister. Another member of the Government said that the concerns of his colleagues on the back benches are irrational: "In the past few years, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has saved the British economy. All these jobs in agriculture and the service sector that British workers wouldn't do have been taken by ambitious \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . We should be grateful they are here."\par \par \uc2 However, other MPs are backing Mr Brokenshire. One of his supporters said that he had been subjected to unwarranted abuse for speaking out: "The extreme reaction shows that this is how anyone who tells it like it is about the elite gets treated."\par \par \uc2 There is a disconnect between how \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is viewed by affluent Londoners and by those living in less prosperous parts of Britain, said Adam Holloway, the Tory MP for Gravesham, Kent, since 2005. "The truth is that Cameron, Clegg and Miliband don't know what is happening in this country. My constituency has been transformed since I first came to Gravesham. I don't know where these people have come from."\par \par \uc2 He added that he does not blame the \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who are "here to get on", but he said that successive governments have "completely let down generations of working-class people" by presiding over a flawed education and training system. "If you're an employer, who are you going to take on? These well-educated foreign workers or a less well-educated British worker?"\par \par \uc2 Mr Holloway said Britain needs to make a decision soon on whether or not it wants to control its borders: "Either we're a nation, or we're not."\par \par \uc2 His colleague, Stewart Jackson MP, is also concerned about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . He represents Peterborough, where 25,000 \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  have arrived in the past decade and one in 10 homes has no adult who speaks English.\par \par \uc2 Mr Jackson backed the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister. "James Brokenshire hit the nail on the head," he said. "There's a divide, with Tarquin and Jocasta on one side, in their 4x4, sipping lattes and enjoying having a cheap nanny and builder. On the other side are Mavis and Bert in Crewe, who see their children struggling to get a home and their grandchildren being crowded out of the local schools."\par \par \uc2 It is not only the Tories who are in turmoil over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . There are also divisions on the centre-Left, where Jon Cruddas, Ed Miliband's policy co-ordinator, has long said that Labour needs to pay more attention to voters' concerns about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Mr Cruddas argues that a "race to the bottom" - with \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  encouraged purely to benefit business, with too little thought given to the social consequences - has hit the low-paid. This view is opposed by other members of the shadow cabinet.\par \par \uc2 Demos - the think tank favoured by recovering Blairites and metropolitan, moderate Lefties, and which hosted Mr Brokenshire's speech last week - is also having difficulties of its own. Its director, David Goodhart, has just stepped aside after his "politically incorrect" views angered some of the organisation's leading supporters. He has since been sidelined and given the title "editor-at-large". Last week, it emerged that Damos has appointed a new director.\par \par \uc2 What was Mr Goodhart's alleged crime? Last year, he wrote a book that outraged liberal opinion. In The British Dream: Successes and Failures of Postwar \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2 , he argued powerfully that a smug ruling class has grown deaf to the legitimate concerns of millions of Britons who worry about the scale and pace of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140309ea390006x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 PROFILE DOREEN AND NEVILLE LAWRENCE\par \par \uc2 Despite police efforts to discredit them, the parents have long comported themselves with great dignity, says William Langley\par \par \uc2 Twenty-one years after their son's murder, Neville and Baroness Doreen Lawrence remain united in their search for justice, and by the dignity with which they somehow manage to carry themselves, whatever their latest setback.\par \par \uc2 When they speak, their tone is strikingly similar - cautious, reproachful, pained - and their faces show the shared weariness of the long fight. In one sense, Stephen's death holds them together, but in another it has driven them apart. A young life destroyed by racist thugs in 1993 is only one element of the Lawrence tragedy, which now lives on as a kind of national admonishment. The close family Stephen grew up with is no more.\par \par \uc2 The Lawrences, who had come to Britain from Jamaica in the Sixties, were content in their obscurity. Their lives told the dull side of the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  story: work, church, children, a belief in their new country and a house in south-east London to suggest that they were doing the right thing. One night in April 1993, Neville's and Doreen's eldest son, aged 18, was stabbed to death at a bus stop by a gang of white youths, and no one seemed to care.\par \par \uc2 The Lawrences' faith in their new country had, admittedly, taken a few knocks down the years, but enough of it survived for them to believe that their son's death would matter to someone other than themselves. Instead, they met indifference, suspicion, even hostility. Last week's remarkable developments are a testimony to what these two "ordinary" people have achieved - and without resort to mob politics or connivance with the outside interests that look for such causes to exploit.\par \par \uc2 Their approach from the start has been one of patience, dignity and reason. Last week, all that the Lawrences have long said about Stephen's death became that much clearer. An investigation by Mark Ellison QC found that the Metropolitan Police, rather than investigate the case, had tried to discredit the family, and then cover up its multiple failures to bring the killers to justice.\par \par \uc2 Theresa May, the Home Secretary, responded by announcing a public inquiry into the activities of the nowdisbanded Special Demonstration Squad, which used undercover officers to infiltrate groups or individuals about whom the police had suspicions.\par \par \uc2 In typically understated fashion, Baroness Lawrence told the House of Lords: "We weren't asking for anything special. Just what we should have had, like any other citizens of this country." In matching tone, Mr Lawrence told the BBC's Newsnight: "To hear this being said on TV so the wider world could hear... I felt vindicated. If people had listened to us earlier, perhaps things would have been different."\par \par \uc2 The Lawrences, divorced since 1999, lead very different lives. Ennobled last year, the Baroness, 60, maintains a relatively high profile as an activist and arbiter on community relations, and has appeared everywhere from the Tate gallery (as the subject of a Turner Prize-winning painting) to the Olympic Games opening ceremony and Desert Island Discs. In public, she comes across as imperturbable, even detached from the fiercely emotional issues that surround her. There is an unmistakeable Britishness about her that speaks both to her generation and the manner in which she was brought up.\par \par \uc2 She has no desire to make a fuss, let alone to weep and shake her fists in public. Yet she has that stubborn streak, that very British scepticism about authority, which won't let her roll over and be dictated to.\par \par \uc2 She remains resolutely unforgiving - of the youths who killed her son, and of the police who have failed her. "People who talk about me as liking attention," she once said. "They should come and walk in my shoes. Does anyone honestly think I wanted this? I would give anything to have a normal life where people don't look at me in the street."\par \par \uc2 A long time ago, they had a normal life. Mr Lawrence had come to Britain in one of the early waves of Caribbean \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , agog, as he remembers it, with the sense of possibility, and in awe of the assumed greatness of the mother country. Life was nowhere near as easy as he had hoped, but he struggled by on his skills as a handyman and decorator, and at 27, tall, handsome and just-aboutsolvent, he met Doreen.\par \par \uc2 A pretty, petite 17-year-old, she had arrived in Britain as a child, and after leaving school found a job as a clerk at the \uc2 National Westminster Bank\uc2 . They both loved soul music and Jamaican food, but Doreen's parents were concerned about the age difference, and their wedding in 1972 was held in an atmosphere of ill-concealed disapproval.\par \par \uc2 Yet they were happy together, happier still when Stephen was born two years later. In her memoirs, Doreen describes Neville as a wonderful father; kindly, funny but firm when necessary. Two more children, Stuart and Georgina, followed, and the Lawrences slogged their way towards the kind of life that had attracted them to Britain in the first place.\par \par \uc2 They contradicted the flashy, swaggering African-Caribbean stereotype that the police seem to have expected. The children adhered to high standards of behaviour and achievement. Meals were a family occasion, TV was rationed, study was encouraged, Sunday services at the local Methodist church were an obligation.\par \par \uc2 Today, Mr Lawrence lives in Jamaica, a short distance from Stephen's grave. The only public memorial to the teenager in Britain is a pavement plaque in Eltham, south-east London, close to where he died. It has been repeatedly defaced with eggs, excrement and racist graffiti, and the family decided that Stephen would rest more peacefully in their ancestral homeland.\par \par \uc2 The distance - physical and otherwise - between the Lawrences now is so great that neither can really say if it was Stephen's death that ended their marriage. Baroness Lawrence has hinted that it was headed for trouble anyway, but Neville tends to differ.\par \par \uc2 "Our world began falling apart from the moment the hospital staff told us our son had died," he has said. "For some reason that I have tried to understand, and can't, we couldn't reach out to each other. We stayed together for another six years, but from that day we never physically touched each other again."\par \par \uc2 Today, when they appear together, it is almost always with a lawyer placed between them. They rarely speak to each other, and, while both remain committed to the long search for a settlement, Mr Lawrence - the more introverted of the two - has little taste for legal and political jousting. He says he pities rather than hates Stephen's killers, blaming their upbringings in a world of alienation, ignorance and criminality.\par \par \uc2 The realisation that the police saw Stephen as "just another murdered black kid", whose death was barely worth investigating, reunited the Lawrences behind his cause, but it didn't bring them back together. Their campaign began quietly, with the lobbying of local councillors and MPs and, in 1994, the launch of a private prosecution against five local men. Their campaign's profile was raised by visits from Nelson Mandela in 1993 and 1998.\par \par \uc2 Away from the courts and the cameras, the Lawrences were becoming strangers to each other. She accused him of being "remote", while he argued that he needed to grieve in his own way. In her memoirs, Baroness Lawrence complains that he drifted away from the family, leaving her to face the inquest and continue the fight alone. Neville responds that he couldn't stay in England, having been warned by his doctors that he would suffer a breakdown if he did. Stuart, 37, is a London teacher, Georgina, 32, works in design.\par \par \uc2 So we move towards what could be the closing chapter of a case that has affected and affronted Britain in ways that could never have been imagined back in 1993, when an ordinary teenager left an ordinary home on what should have been an ordinary day.\par \par \uc2 Except that for the Lawrence family, nothing is ever ordinary.\par \par \uc2 "The Lawrences' approach from the start has been one of patience and reason\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140309ea390007d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

And there is no doubt about it. The fight is now on for the future of our continent."\par \par \uc2 He referred to the electoral successes of France's Front National, the Netherlands' PVV party and Greece's Golden Dawn as examples of this.\par \par \uc2 And though he did not include Ukip in this definition, he said: "An ungenerous, backwards looking politics has emerged in Britain." Referring to Ukip's leader Nigel Farage, he added: "The politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg and his Lib Dem colleagues have sought to turn May's European elections into a straight fight between them and Ukip, arguing they are the only two parties with a clear strategy on Europe. Mr Clegg and Mr Farage will hold a live debate on Britain's membership of the EU just weeks before the ballot.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dem leader argued that his pro-European stance was more democratic than that of more eurosceptic parties, saying: "I love Britain... I love that, while we may be an island, we have always looked beyond our shores." He called his party "the guardians of a modern, open and tolerant Britain".\par \par \uc2 Lib Dem ministers have been pushing an openly pro-EU, pro-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  platform. They include Ed Davey, the energy secretary, who told the BBC's \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show his party wanted to increase \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  by relaxing visa restrictions on \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 ' extended families.\par \par \uc2 Mr Davey said: "Where family life is involved, where it is someone's family life, where it is someone's husband or wife, I do think we should be more welcoming."\par \par \uc2 MPs and advisers admit the strategy is risky, but say that with the party at risk of losing all its MEPs in May, it has to try a change of tack. "These positions might often be thought unpopular," said one official. "But there is nothing to lose now. We might as well make a virtue of who we are."\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140309ea39000p2\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 BBC's Left-of-Centre viewpoint frustrates Conservative MP Phil Davies\b0\par\par\uc2 By Marco Giannangeli   \par \uc2 581 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 03:09\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 THE BBC is so politically biased it should lose taxpayer funding and be made into a voluntary pay subscription service, a senior MP said last night.\par \par \uc2 His call comes after the Sunday Express was handed a list of more than 50 items purporting to demonstrate left-wing bias in BBC news reporting last year.\par \par \uc2 It includes items from the flagship Radio 4 news programme Today, BBC 2\u8217\'20\'19s Newsnight, internet coverage and the 24-hour news channel.\par \par \uc2 For example, on June 27, Today co-host Evan Davis challenged the Government\u8217\'20\'19s position on fracking with the words: \u8220\'20\'1CThe Government appear to be proposing some kind of community compensation, let\u8217\'20\'19s call it a bribe, let\u8217\'20\'19s call it a bribe shall we?"\par \par \uc2 On the day it was reported that recorded crime figures had dropped by 10 per cent since the Coalition Government took office, the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s website led with a story about police budget cuts.\par \par \uc2 Many of the examples are sins of omission. For example in \u173\'00\'ADOctober, Will Straw, director of the Institute for Policy Research think-tank was interviewed about Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s pledge to freeze energy prices for two years. The think-tank was described as \u8220\'20\'1Ccentre left" but it was not disclosed Mr Straw was a Labour parliamentary candidate, even when Labour policy was discussed.\par \par \uc2 A report by BBC News in July quoted \u8220\'20\'1Cuniversity think-tank" Million\u8217\'20\'19s assertion that England was facing a shortage of teachers without saying the think tank is run and staffed almost exclusively by Labour insiders.\par \par \uc2 On March 19, Today failed to point out the Resolution Foundation is a centre-Left think-tank, though it made clear that Policy Exchange is right of centre. Last year BBC political editor Nick Robinson admitted the BBC had made a \u8220\'20\'1Cterrible mistake" by not reflecting public concern about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  during Blair\u8217\'20\'19s years.\par \par \uc2 Last night Phil Davies MP said: \u8220\'20\'1CThere is without a doubt an institutional left-wing bias at the BBC. I don\u8217\'20\'19t say it is always deliberate. The problem is there are so many like-minded people in the organisation who don\u8217\'20\'19t see there is any challenge to the way their metropolitan, metrosexual view of the world.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey need to get out more and mix with the ordinary \u173\'00\'ADpeople outside of their middle-class, champagne-socialist circles. As long as the law exists that forces us all to pay for the BBC from our taxes, it is going to have to do a damned sight better at being impartial.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn my opinion the licence fee must be replaced by a voluntary subscription service."\par \par \uc2 A recent report on BBC bias by the right-of-centre \uc2 Centre for Policy Studies\uc2  found only one centre left think-tank received a \u8220\'20\'1Chealth warning" more than once in every 10 times it was mentioned while right-wing think- tanks were introduced that way one in four mentions.\par \par \uc2 Director Tim Knox said: \u8220\'20\'1CWe are very concerned that there is a left bias within the BBC."\par \par \uc2 Former BBC journalist David Keighley now runs Newswatch, and has monitored BBC bias towards the EU for more than 15 years. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat we have found is a systematic under-representation of the case for withdrawing from the EU," he said.\par \par \uc2 Last night a BBC spokesman said: \u8220\'20\'1CBBC News provides impartial and independent coverage across all outlets and we have a responsibility to report a range of different viewpoints."\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140309ea390015x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw157\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2355\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 HS - News\par \b \uc2 Memo to Danny Alexander: the very things that make London rich make us poor ...\b0\par\par\uc2 Comment  By Iain Macwhirter   \par \uc2 1,311 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Herald\par \uc2 SUNDHE\par \uc2 1\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014, Herald & Times Group   \par \par \uc2 SCOTTISH independence. \uc2 Aggreko\uc2  warns of risks.\u8221\'20\'1D The Scottish front pages have been reduced to a proforma. They just fill in the dots. Alliance warns of risks, Standard Life warns of risks, RBS warns of risks ... Lloyds ... BP ... Shell ... Sainsbury\u8217\'20\'19s. There is a weary inevitability about the coverage of the referendum campaign. George Osborne says No, Ed Balls says No, Danny Alexander says No, Johann Lamont says nothing at all. A coalition of the City of London, the political classes and a UK-dominated media laying down the law. Wagging a finger. No means No!\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m beginning to wonder whether this isn\u8217\'20\'19t becoming just a little counterproductive for Better Together. This relentless procession of finance companies, business bosses, Tory politicians all lecturing, scolding, tut-tutting and shaking their heads. You can\u8217\'20\'19t have the pound, we\u8217\'20\'19ll take our ball away. Your money won\u8217\'20\'19t be safe because we\u8217\'20\'19ll take the banks. We\u8217\'20\'19ll try to destabilise your cross-border pension funds \u8211\'20\'13 don\u8217\'20\'19t expect any co-operation from us. If you don\u8217\'20\'19t do as you are told, we\u8217\'20\'19ll take your passports away and have you kicked out of Europe. We\u8217\'20\'19ll put up the price of food in the shops, and your mobile phone charges, and your insurance rates.\par \par \uc2 Eventually people are going to ask themselves: who exactly is running this country? Who are these people to make these threats? Who elected all these financiers and captains of industry? \uc2 Bob Dudley\uc2 , the boss of BP who earned $8.7 million last year, heads a firm that isn\u8217\'20\'19t even British any more. Since when did we allow banks to make our political choices for us? The degree of direct political involvement by big business in this referendum campaign is unprecedented, and deeply disturbing. It is reminiscent of Latin America in the bad old days, of US dirty tricks and Yankee colonialism.\par \par \uc2 Normally, companies avoid taking political sides in Western democracies, because, well, they are supposed to be democratic countries. And it can damage business. As I noted last week, a lot of Scots \u8211\'20\'13 Yes and No voters \u8211\'20\'13 will be taking their money out of \u173\'00\'ADStandard Life and RBS and shifting to \uc2 Barclays\uc2 , whose chief executive recently said he would at least try to make any arrangement work. And \uc2 Ryanair\uc2  has become the airline of choice for thousands of Scots, after their canny boss said: yeah, sure, whatever.\par \par \uc2 I can\u8217\'20\'19t speak for the Labour Party in Scotland, but I can tell you how it looks to many of their voters: an unpopular front with the discredited Liberal Democrats, the loathed UK Tories and the City of London. It\u8217\'20\'19s these daily hectorings about the irresponsibility of independence from the finance houses, Alliance, Standard Life, RBS, Lloyds \u8211\'20\'13 the very people who nearly destroyed the UK economy out of unrestrained greed \u8211\'20\'13 that sticks in my personal craw. Being lectured on public responsibility by banks is like being lectured on childcare by paedophiles.\par \par \uc2 A campaign that is based almost entirely on fear is a campaign that has lost the argument. Correction: it hasn\u8217\'20\'19t lost the argument on the Union because it hardly bothered to make it in the first place. A few platitudes about Team GB and Nelson Mandela from \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  in his Olympic speech does not amount to a reasoned case or claim of right. Then the dambusters took over. I defy anyone to compare the New Statesman lecture from \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  last week in London with what we heard from Danny Alexander in Edinburgh.\par \par \uc2 A lot of people dislike the First Minister, and perhaps with some justification. He can be a bit full of himself. He was fairly criticised for equivocating on whether he would cut the top rate of income tax in Scotland if it was still in place in England \u8211\'20\'13 though just imagine the threats that would have come from all those business interests if he had. But the point is that the referendum isn\u8217\'20\'19t about \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  or the SNP running Scotland \u8211\'20\'13 it is about the right of Scots to run Scotland and choose the government of their choice. Right now, Scotland is being run by the City of London and the UK political establishment.\par \par \uc2 This conflation of the personality of \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  with the case for Yes is the disingenuous means by which the left in London has sought to ally themselves with financial corporatism against Scotland. Ah \u8211\'20\'13 he\u8217\'20\'19s just like the rest of them, \u8220\'20\'1Cshovelling even more wealth to the elite\u8221\'20\'1D, tweets Owen Jones, the BBC Question Time\u8217\'20\'19s favourite tame lefty, clearly knowing and caring nothing about what has been happening in Scotland. Like ending means-tested prescriptions, scrapping tuition fees, promoting childcare, resisting the bedroom tax, and defending policies such as free personal care. You would think the left in London would be glad there was an alternative political space opening up in which it is possible to challenge the neoliberal consensus.\par \par \uc2 And come to think of it, which party actually did press for the abolition of university tuition fees? It was the SNP, and it was opposed by the Labour Party in Scotland, which regards these policies as part of \u8220\'20\'1Cthe something for nothing society\u8221\'20\'1D. Salmond told the New Statesman audience last week that Scotland doesn\u8217\'20\'19t want to be a part of a country that is dominated by the anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , anti-welfare, low-tax government of which Danny Alexander is a leading figure. He tried to spell out how Scotland could be a beacon of progressive policies that could counter the relentless drift to the right of the city state of London which now dominates the UK, and as even Vince Cable said, is sucking the wealth out of the rest of it.\par \par \uc2 One of the most chilling experiences I have had recently was at an \uc2 NHS\uc2  Scotland conference last week on welfare reform in Scotland. The impact of the \uc2 UK Government\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s welfare reforms is devastating \u8211\'20\'13 especially on the many Scots with disabilities the bedroom tax is causing huge hardship, food banks are running on empty and, as our report shows today, poverty has returned to Scotland in a way I could never have imagined a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 George Osborne is planning to push through another \u163\'00\'A312 billion in cuts to people who are workless through no fault of their own. And there is nothing that the Scottish Parliament can do about it because it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t control welfare \u8211\'20\'13 or taxation, or the huge oil revenues that flow to the London exchequer to finance Boris Johnson\u8217\'20\'19s grandiose schemes. Politics of envy? Damn right.\par \par \uc2 And what was the Unionist response? Danny Alexander coming north wagging his finger, and warning: \u8220\'20\'1Cthe currency decision is final\u8221\'20\'1D \u8211\'20\'13 and anyone who doesn\u8217\'20\'19t get it will be sent to the back of the class and held after school. Well, here\u8217\'20\'19s a message to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury: the currency decision, Mr Alexander, will never be final, because it is not in the \uc2 UK Government\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s gift to make it. The pound is common property of the UK, not London\u8217\'20\'19s toy balloon.\par \par \uc2 As for the threat on cross-border pension schemes \u8211\'20\'13 the EU is on the point of announcing that it wants to see a lot more of them. His pensions warning was just another nasty little scare, like mortgage rates, Europe, food prices. And don\u8217\'20\'19t think this scolding, contemptuous tone from the London financial establishment will somehow disappear if Scots obediently vote No. We\u8217\'20\'19ve learned a lot in the past few weeks about power and how it is distributed. The campaign has revealed the true face of the Union. They may win the referendum, but they\u8217\'20\'19ve lost Scotland.\par \par \uc2 Document SUNDHE0020140309ea390000m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw157\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2355\pichgoal600

Perhaps that\u8217\'20\'19s why, though he doesn\u8217\'20\'19t make children\u8217\'20\'19s films, he makes children of many of us, eager for the sort of escapism that Anderson alone provides.\par \par \uc2 The director\u8217\'20\'19s whimsical style is an acquired taste, perhaps. But when he\u8217\'20\'19s on the money, as he is with The Grand Budapest Hotel, he\u8217\'20\'19s irresistible.\par \par \uc2 This is the sort of adventure commonly seen in the 1930s or 1940s, complete with eccentric characters, murder, conspiracy, secret societies, alpine chases, prison breaks and exotic locales, laced with a little romance and set to a backdrop of impending war. But the mixing of this heady concoction is unmistakably Anderson\u8217\'20\'19s.\par \par \uc2 At its heart is the splendid creation Monsieur Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes), concierge of the eponymous hotel, in a spa town in the fictional, Eastern European country of Zubrowka on the eve of the Second World War. Gustave is a rum chap, staunchly good at his job \u8211\'20\'13 authoritative, precise, efficient, all-seeing \u8211\'20\'13 yet with a few peccadilloes. He swears like a trooper, for one. He\u8217\'20\'19s vain, never stepping out unless drenched in his favourite cologne, L\u8217\'20\'19Air de Panache. And he has a penchant for his elderly female guests.\par \par \uc2 When one such octogenarian flame, Madame D (a fabulously grotesque Tilda Swinton) drops dead, Gustave becomes the recipient of her most valuable painting \u8211\'20\'13 much to the chagrin of the old lady\u8217\'20\'19s money-grabbing family, led by the evil Dmitri (Adrien Brody), who will kill to get it back.\par \par \uc2 And so, with trusty bellboy and prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9 Zero (Tony Revolori) by his side, and as fascists start to make their presence felt in his country, Gustave H goes on the run.\par \par \uc2 Into the action comes a dazzling array of characters, among them a military policeman (Edward Norton), Dmitri\u8217\'20\'19s murderous henchman (Willem Dafoe), a lawyer with a dash of Freud in his beard (Jeff Goldblum) and the Society of the Crossed Keys, an order of concierges serving at the best hotels around the world (Bill Murray amongst them), which comes to Gustave\u8217\'20\'19s assistance.\par \par \uc2 Many of these actors are Anderson regulars. Fiennes is new to the fold, but born to it, exercising rarely seen comedic chops in a performance that is perfectly pitched between vanity and humanity, decorum and anarchy. Few speak as well as Fiennes, and his diction alone makes the character at once hilariously silly and disarmingly touching.\par \par \uc2 The film\u8217\'20\'19s production design verges on animation sometimes \u8211\'20\'13 not least when miniature models are used to convey the exterior of the hotel and a tremendous ski chase. But anyone who has visited one of those chocolate-boxy Eastern European towns will recognise the real, Old World recreated throughout.\par \par \uc2 As always, beneath the film\u8217\'20\'19s heightened facade lie serious themes. Families, dysfunctional or adopted, have always been in the mix from Rushmore through to Moonrise Kingdom. Here, Gustave is the paterfamilias of the hotel family, while to the young, \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  Zero he changes from father figure to brother \u8211\'20\'13 in keeping with the boy\u8217\'20\'19s growing experience \u8211\'20\'13 and always an inspiration.\par \par \uc2 Storytelling itself is another recurrent theme. Here, we view Gustave\u8217\'20\'19s adventures through two layers of recollection, first that of a writer in the 1980s (Tom Wilkinson), recalling how his younger self (Jude Law) once met the older Zero, in the fading hotel of the 1960s, who himself recounts the story of his youth.\par \par \uc2 The construct highlights our sense of entering a vanished world, one which will be undone by the ravages of war.\par \par \uc2 Document SUNDHE0020140309ea390002v\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Fabulous\par \b \uc2 Fabulous report: The stolen children; On average, two youngsters a day in the UK and Ireland are snatched by a parent \u8211\'20\'13 and it\u8217\'20\'19s on the increase. Louise travelled to Syria to find her daughter, May, who had been abducted by her father\b0\par\par\uc2 BY BEN GELBLUM & CLAIE WILSON   \par \uc2 2,116 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 04:00\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Sweating in the dusty heat, Louise Monaghan stared at the ragged refugees pouring across the border. They were desperate to escape war-torn Syria for a new life in Turkey \u8211\'20\'13 but she was about to go in. She handed her passport to the border guard, who warned her that Syria was filled with bandits and she\u8217\'20\'19d probably be killed as she travelled the three miles to her destination.\par \par \uc2 But it was a risk Dublin-born Louise was willing to take \u8211\'20\'13 because her former husband had abducted their six-year-old daughter, May, and taken her to a small village near the Syrian city of Idlib.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMay was stolen from her mother, her home," says Louise. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19d have done anything to get my little girl back."\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s a nightmare scenario for any parent \u8211\'20\'13 and, worryingly, one that\u8217\'20\'19s on the rise. Figures recently released by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) found parental child abduction and custody cases have more than doubled in the last decade.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn 2010, there were 394 UK cases reported to us, but in 2013 this rose to 520," says Alison Shalaby, Chief Executive of Reunite, a charity that helps parents in such cases. She attributes this rise to the ease of travelling around the globe and an increase in relationships between different nationalities.\par \par \uc2 According to the FCO, many parents are never reunited with their abducted children. And even if cases are resolved, the process can often take up to 10 years.\par \par \uc2 For Louise, 39, her ordeal started when she filed for divorce from her Syrian husband, Mostafa Assad, in 2008.\par \par \uc2 They\u8217\'20\'19d met five years earlier when Louise was living in Cyprus, working as a hairdresser. She instantly fell for Mostafa\u8217\'20\'19s charm and good looks, and their daughter, May, was born in April 2005. Two years later, the couple married \u8211\'20\'13 but after their wedding, Mostafa, 38, a construction worker, became violent and controlling.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHe would fly into jealous rages," remembers Louise. \u8220\'20\'1CIt was utterly terrifying, so I told him I wanted a divorce."\par \par \uc2 When the divorce was finalised in November 2010, Mostafa was granted access to May for a few hours, three times a week, but Louise was wary.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere was a tiny part of me that worried he might steal May, so I took precautions by putting her on a \u8216\'20\'18stop list\u8217\'20\'19, preventing either of us from taking her out of Cyprus without the other\u8217\'20\'19s permission," she remembers.\par \par \uc2 In September 2011, the day before May, then six, was due to start school, Mostafa arranged to take her to the beach. When he didn\u8217\'20\'19t return with her a few hours later, Louise instinctively knew something was wrong.\par \par \uc2 She started frantically searching the streets for her daughter and repeatedly calling Mostafa. At first, his phone was switched off but when she did get through a few hours later, it had an international ringing tone. Mostafa answered, boasting he\u8217\'20\'19d flown May to northern Cyprus, then driven her to Syria, 316 miles away, so she could have a proper Muslim upbringing.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI knew I might never see May again, so I had to think on my feet," remembers Louise. \u8220\'20\'1CAlthough I felt sick saying it, I told Mostafa I loved him and wanted to be with him, too. I said everything I could to persuade him, because I knew May would disappear forever if I didn\u8217\'20\'19t."\par \par \uc2 Louise then spoke to her bewildered daughter, desperately trying to reassure her that everything would be OK.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMay wasn\u8217\'20\'19t that close to her dad so I knew she would be terrified," she explains. \u8220\'20\'1CIt was a completely alien environment for her, and so scary as there was a war raging all around them. She was tearful and frightened \u8211\'20\'13 I had to stay calm for her sake, but inside I was distraught."\par \par \uc2 Mostafa told Louise that unless she came back to him as an obedient wife, she\u8217\'20\'19d never see her child again. In desperation, she agreed.\par \par \uc2 Once off the phone, she contacted Irish and Cypriot authorities. They issued a warrant for Mostafa\u8217\'20\'19s arrest and advised her not to go to Syria \u8211\'20\'13 but Louise was determined.\par \par \uc2 Three days after the phone call, she flew into Turkey, then crossed the border and walked the three miles to the town of Idlib in north-west Syria, where Mostafa picked her up. Taking Louise\u8217\'20\'19s passport away, he threw a black hijab and long dress at her, telling her it was the only thing she would be wearing from now on.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThen he drove us to the house he was staying in, and I was reunited with May," recalls Louise. \u8220\'20\'1CIt was just four days since I\u8217\'20\'19d last seen her, but she looked so different. Her hair was tightly plaited and she was wearing long-sleeved Arab village clothing. She also had bruises all over her arms, from where her father had forced her on to the plane."\par \par \uc2 Suspecting that Louise would attempt to flee with May, Mostafa kept them both locked in the house as the conflict raged around them.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt was terrifying, hearing bombs and shooting nearby," recalls Louise. \u8220\'20\'1CWe had barely any food, and as a woman I had no rights. At any stage, Mostafa could have beaten me to death and claimed I\u8217\'20\'19d been unfaithful."\par \par \uc2 Nearly three weeks later, Louise was allowed to call her sister Mandy in Dublin, who was arranging a money transfer for her. \u8220\'20\'1CI desperately hoped she\u8217\'20\'19d sorted our rescue, but my heart broke when she told me no one was coming for us," Louise remembers. \u8220\'20\'1CApparently, the Irish government couldn\u8217\'20\'19t do anything as it was just too dangerous. We were on our own."\par \par \uc2 Mostafa, May and Louise\par \par \uc2 Later that day, Mostafa drove the family to a nearby city to renew the visa he\u8217\'20\'19d obtained for Louise. Leaving her and May in the car, he went into the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  office with the paperwork. Louise seized her chance. With just \u163\'00\'A3123 in local currency in her pocket, she grabbed May and ran to a nearby taxi rank, begging a kindly-looking driver to take them to the Irish consulate in the Syrian capital, Damascus, 200 miles away.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt was a six-hour drive along dirt roads through places where people were being killed every day," recalls Louise, who made sure her hijab covered every blonde hair on her head.\par \par \uc2 Once in Damascus, Louise and May stayed in a safe house for two weeks while the Irish embassy tried to organise their escape.\par \par \uc2 But because Mostafa had reported her, Louise was now... a fugitive. Wanted for kidnapping May, she faced life imprisonment or death by stoning under Islamic sharia law \u8211\'20\'13 and the embassy couldn\u8217\'20\'19t convince the authorities to let them leave Syria.\par \par \uc2 With the civil war worsening, Louise and May were on their own. In desperation, Mandy got in touch with some people who agreed to smuggle them out of the country \u8211\'20\'13 for a fee. She paid them with the money Louise had transferred and, a few days later, three armed men arrived in the dead of night and drove Louise and May into the mountains six miles away.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI had no idea if I could trust them, but I had no choice," says Louise. \u8220\'20\'1CWhen the mountains got too steep, we had to leave the car and walk, throwing ourselves to the ground when we saw an army patrol below. May was trying to be brave, and I clutched her hand tightly, terrified for us both."\par \par \uc2 Early the next morning, on October 14, they crossed the Lebanese border, where a representative from the Irish consulate met them and took them back to Dublin. \u8220\'20\'1CNo words can describe how grateful I am to everybody who risked their lives to bring us home," says Louise, who now lives in Ireland with May and advises other parents in similar situations. She has written a book about her experience, which is being turned into a Hollywood movie.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI guess it\u8217\'20\'19s an amazing story. We were lucky," she smiles. \u8220\'20\'1CFor a while after we got home, I\u8217\'20\'19d find food stashed around May\u8217\'20\'19s room, which must have been because she\u8217\'20\'19d gone hungry in Syria. She was clingy for a long time, too, and still doesn\u8217\'20\'19t like to be with strangers much. She\u8217\'20\'19s had therapy to deal with it all and I\u8217\'20\'19m proud of how well she\u8217\'20\'19s doing now."\par \par \uc2 Although there is an international arrest warrant for Mostafa for abduction and breaching a court order, he has never been caught.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSome days I wonder where he is or what he may be planning," says Louise. \u8220\'20\'1CBut if I worried about it all the time, I wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t leave the house. I just make sure I never speak ill of him to May. I say her dad wasn\u8217\'20\'19t thinking clearly as he loves her so much, and it was my job to bring her back to a safer place."\par \par \uc2 Research from the FCO found that 74 per cent of people believe that fathers are more likely to abduct their children than mothers \u8211\'20\'13 but surprisingly, the opposite is true.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn 70 per cent of the cases reported to us, it\u8217\'20\'19s the mother who has taken the child," says Alison from Reunite. \u8220\'20\'1CWhen relationships go sour, they might want to go home to the support of their family, without thinking of the child\u8217\'20\'19s best interests."\par \par \uc2 Tragically, Safraz Khan, 44, from Croydon, has first-hand experience of this. In August 2011, his daughter, Aamina, then six, was snatched by her mum, Humma, 39, and taken to Pakistan.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI can\u8217\'20\'19t even begin to imagine why Humma would take our daughter, who enjoyed her school, her friends and her life here," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CShe had all that happiness and security, yet her mother took her to a foreign, dangerous place. I can only think she did it to spite me."\par \par \uc2 Safraz and Humma, who were both doctors, had an arranged marriage in 2004, but their relationship fell apart and they separated four years later. Safraz was awarded custody of Aamina.\par \par \uc2 Safraz has spent more than two years searching for his daughter Aamina\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe court felt she was better off with me as I was her primary carer," explains Safraz. \u8220\'20\'1CThe arrangement meant I had her throughout the week, while Humma had her three weekends out of four and we shared all holidays. Humma never appealed or went back to court, so I thought she was happy with the arrangement."\par \par \uc2 But then on August 20 2011, Humma collected Aamina for the holidays and, six days later, secretly took her away to Pakistan, where she had relatives.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen I went to collect Aamina the day before she was due to go to school on September 6, nobody answered the door," remembers Safraz. \u8220\'20\'1CUnder the terms of the residence order, Humma knew she wasn\u8217\'20\'19t allowed to take our daughter out of the country. I spoke to her family, who tried to convince me that they were in the Lake District, but I knew something was seriously wrong and reported her missing."\par \par \uc2 Aamina still hasn\u8217\'20\'19t been found. The police in London and Pakistan have been involved in trying to find her and Safraz has spent \u163\'00\'A380,000 searching for his daughter. He believes she is in Pakistan, but when the family house there was raided, although some school books were found, there was no sign of his daughter.\par \par \uc2 Humma, Safraz and Aamina\par \par \uc2 While Louise and May are doing everything they can to rebuild their lives, Safraz is still in limbo, not able to let go or move forward.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis July I am going to miss Aamina\u8217\'20\'19s ninth birthday," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CSometimes I dream I find her and we\u8217\'20\'19re hugging and crying, but then I wake up and she\u8217\'20\'19s still gone. Part of me feels like I\u8217\'20\'19m now grieving for her, but I will never give up."\par \par \uc2 FYI\par \par \uc2 35 children were abducted and taken from the UK to Pakistan in 2012/13 \u8211\'20\'13 more are taken there than anywhere else in the world.*\par \par \uc2 For advice, visit {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://Reunite.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Reunite.org}}}\uc2  or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://Gov.uk/international-child-abduction"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Gov.uk/international-child-abduction}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Photography: Conor Buckley Hair & make-up: Ciara Allen Sources: *Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Department of Justice & Equality, Ireland\par \par \uc2 Stolen: Escape From Syria by Louise Monaghan (\u163\'00\'A37.99, Mainstream Publishing)\par \par \uc2 By Ben Gelblum & Claie Wilson\par \par \uc2 Document THESUK0020140309ea39001me\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Bias 'should cost BBC its licence fee'\b0\par\par\uc2 Marco Giannangeli   \par \uc2 597 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Express\par \uc2 THEXSU\par \uc2 1s1; Lancs\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) Copyright Express Newspapers 2014   \par \par \uc2 THE BBC is so politically biased it should lose taxpayer funding and be made into a voluntary pay subscription service, a senior MP said last night.\par \par \uc2 His call comes after the Sunday Express was handed a list of more than 50 items purporting to demonstrate Left-wing bias in BBC news reporting last year.\par \par \uc2 It includes items from the flagship Radio 4 news programme Today, BBC 2's Newsnight, internet coverage and the 24-hour news channel.\par \par \uc2 For example, on June 27, Today co-host Evan Davis challenged the Government's position on fracking with the words: "The Government appear to be proposing some kind of community compensation, let's call it a bribe, let's call it a bribe shall we?" On the day it was reported that recorded crime figures had dropped by 10 per cent since the Coalition Government took office, the BBC's website led with a story about police budget cuts.\par \par \uc2 Many of the examples are sins of omission. For example in October, \uc2 Will Straw\uc2 , director of the Institute for Policy Research think-tank was interviewed about Ed Miliband's pledge to freeze energy prices for two years. The think-tank was described as "centre Left" but it was not disclosed Mr Straw was a Labour parliamentary candidate, even when Labour policy was discussed.\par \par \uc2 A report by BBC News in July quoted "university think-tank" Million's assertion that England was facing a shortage of teachers without saying the think-tank is run and staffed almost exclusively by Labour insiders. Last year BBC political editor \uc2 Nick Robinson\uc2  admitted the BBC made a "terrible mistake" by not reflecting public concern about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  during Blair's years.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday Phil Davies MP said: "There is without a doubt an institutional Left-wing bias at the BBC. I don't say it is always deliberate. The problem is there are so many like-minded people in the organisation who don't see there is any challenge to their metropolitan, metrosexual view of the world.\par \par \uc2 "As long as the law exists that forces us all to pay for the BBC from our taxes, it is going to have to do a damned sight better at being impartial.\par \par \uc2 "In my opinion the licence fee must be replaced by a voluntary subscription service."\par \par \uc2 Director Tim Knox said: "We are very concerned that there is a Left bias within the BBC."\par \par \uc2 Former BBC journalist David Keighley now runs Newswatch, and has monitored BBC bias towards the EU for more than 15 years. "What we have found is a systematic under-representation of the case for withdrawing from the EU," he said.\par \par \uc2 Last night a BBC spokesman said: "BBC News provides impartial and independent coverage across all outlets and we have a responsibility to report a range of different viewpoints."\par \par \uc2 OPINION: PAGE 34\par \par \uc2 Secret plan for subscriptions by 2020\par \par \uc2 A SUBSCRIPTION service could replace the licence fee under recommendations in a secret BBC report, it has been reported. The recommendations are the brainchild of a review panel set up last year by \uc2 James Purnell\uc2 , a former Labour cabinet minister and now BBC strategy director.\par \par \uc2 The 12-strong panel, including leading economists and academics, agreed the licence fee should remain at the same level until 2020 and then be replaced by charges. The BBC charter comes up for renewal in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Plans have already been announced to take the licence fee out of the criminal system, making it a civil offence. More than 100,000 people a year are convicted of evasion.\par \par \uc2 Document THEXSU0020140309ea390000v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 Push on and we'll all get a good school\b0\par\par\uc2 ELEANOR MILLS   \par \uc2 1,403 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 1; Eire\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Not everyone won the school of their choice last week but middle-class parents priced out of private education and \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  ambition are finally driving up standards\par \par \uc2 Well, the sun is shining, and as we bask \u8212\'20\'14 finally \u8212\'20\'14 in some longdeserved warmth and brightness, there is another reason to celebrate too. Last week brought National Offer Day \u8212\'20\'14 that crucial mark on the calendar, hanging over many of us for months, when we finally found out where our offspring would be going to secondary school.\par \par \uc2 For some, including Michael Gove, the education secretary, the news was good. Gove Jr won a place at Grey Coat Hospital school, a (smart) comprehensive in Westminster, London. That makes Gove, incredibly, the first Conservative education secretary to send a child to a state school. Gulp. Given the number of public school-educated blokes clustered around our prime minister (more Old Etonians than women at the last count) I suppose we should count our blessings.\par \par \uc2 While the Gove family is celebrating little Beatrice getting her first-choice school, for half a million other families whose offspring didn't win the place they wanted the week wasn't quite such a happy one. In Bristol, for instance, demand for places was up 8%, in London 5% \u8212\'20\'14 with the result that 31% in the capital got rejected by their preferred school. The education arms race is in full swing; for the grammars, academies and the new free schools, in particular, competition for spaces has been intense. At Tiffin School in Surrey, 1,863 boys tried for 160 places. At the grammar where my own daughter won a place last week there were 2,000 applications for 93 spots. This is set to get even worse as the latest baby boom population bulge takes effect.\par \par \uc2 Rows about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  have raged in the past week, particularly about whether or not it damages the economy. Yet what is clear from the London experience is how much value \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  families put on their children's educational achievement and how that desire to learn is boosting the system. In the queues for the grammar school open days it was striking how the vast majority of aspirant families were of African and Asian background. Sure there was a sprinkling of sharpelbowed middle-class whites in the mix \u8212\'20\'14 yes, I plead guilty to that \u8212\'20\'14 but I hardly saw a single white working-class family.\par \par \uc2 It isn't just me. At the London Academy of Excellence, a free school in the borough of Newham, east London, which opened in 2012 and recently got six pupils into Oxbridge, all but a handful of the intake were from \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  families. So much so that the school has just launched an initiative to target white working-class children (white working-class boys do worse than any other group in British schools and the situation is so bad that the Commons education select committee has devoted sessions to tackling it).\par \par \uc2 It is not just the educationally voracious children of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  driving up standards in the capital. When the head of \uc2 Ofsted\uc2 , Michael Wilshaw, was headmaster at Mossbourne Academy in Hackney, he pioneered an approach called the London Challenge, where outstanding schools such as his mentored and helped to improve standards in others. Wilshaw intends to replicate this programme in areas of chronic educational underachievement around the country including Norfolk, Suffolk and coastal Kent (described to me by one senior educationalist as "education deserts").\par \par \uc2 The expansion of the academies and the free school programme has also helped to improve choice for parents and the demand is intense. The West London Free School, for instance, had 1,124 applicants for 120 places. Also significant in the raising of the bar has been Teach First, a programme which began in 2002 where the brightest graduates spend a couple of years teaching in tough schools. One chief executive I know, whose child attends an academy with a flotilla of Teach First teachers, was so impressed by the sparky young people inspiring his son that he wished he could hire them for his own company.\par \par \uc2 The real proof that the English education system is finally going in the right direction is Wales. While England has embraced the idea of diverse kinds of schools, devolving more power to head teachers, making it easier to get rid of poorly performing staff, using rigorous testing and \uc2 Ofsted\uc2  inspections, Wales remains un-diverse and has scrapped testing and league tables. The result? It has plunged down the Organisation for Economic Development's Pisa league tables from 29th to 38th out of 59 countries for reading, and to 40th from 33rd out of 67 countries for maths. Only 25.8% of children entitled to free school meals in Wales obtained good GCSEs, compared with 38.1% in England.\par \par \uc2 I have a theory that the invasion of Britain by the global super-rich is also boosting state schools by sending a flock of middle-class parents into their fold. Just as bourgeois Brits have been priced out of London areas such as Chelsea, Fulham and Notting Hill or posh parts of the Cotswolds or Cornwall by bankers and billionaires, so the expense of independent schools is beyond them, too.\par \par \uc2 At the beginning of the year Tatler magazine produced its first guide to state schools \u8212\'20\'14 signalling a shift in attitude among the chattering classes in regard to private education. Partly it is born of necessity. Fees at independent schools are now four times as expensive in real terms as they were in the 1980s \u8212\'20\'14 costing between \u163\'00\'A315,000 and \u163\'00\'A330,000 a year a child. When you go round them, as I have been doing recently, it's striking how international they are. At one top boarding school there were only a handful of British girls in the sixth form.\par \par \uc2 With some top universities actively recruiting students from the state sector, many cash-squeezed, privately educated parents are wondering whether it is even worth the sacrifice required to educate their children at an independent school. As one businessman said: "Who needs the old school tie when you've got LinkedIn? Most high-flyers in business these days went to good comprehensives and non-Oxbridge universities and are judged on what they can do, not where they came from. It's much more meritocratic."\par \par \uc2 That view is borne out by Sutton Trust research into social mobility which shows that while the professions are still overwhelmingly the preserve of the privately educated (the law, media and politics being some of the worst offenders), business leaders are more socially mobile. It also comes down to what we want for our children. Personally, I want them to be the kind of people who can go both to a council house and a palace and not only know how to behave but also not feel intimidated. I certainly don't want them to fall prey to the "silent epidemic", as The Times put it recently, of anxiety and eating disorders. Being in more of a social melting pot, rather than a moneyed social pressure cooker, must be good for that.\par \par \uc2 So, well done, Michael Gove, keeping it real(ish) in the poshest government we've had for years; and good luck to all of you lodging appeals or making the best of not having got the school you want. Hopefully with an education secretary with some skin in the game, all our schools will continue to improve.\par \par \uc2 ? Once upon a time there was a prince who flew helicopters and a duchess who said she would do without a nanny and look after her baby herself \u8212\'20\'14 not so hard as she didn't have a job and had a house full of servants. Then the prince quit working as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot in Wales, the duchess jetted off to Mustique, then hired a nanny, left the baby behind and went off with her husband to the Maldives to stay in an epically swanky hotel. Their subjects scratched their heads, wondering what had happened to the grounded couple they had fallen in love with. I fear that this story may not have a happy ending.\par \par \uc2 Do you agree?

\par\par \b \uc2 Political risk on agenda in UK boardrooms\b0\par\par\uc2 By Brian Groom, Business and Employment Editor   \par \uc2 579 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 14:21\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

On issues from energy prices to the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate, to the referendums on Scottish independence and EU membership, business leaders feel under pressure.\par \par \uc2 "Politicians of all persuasions are swinging about," said a FTSE 100 chief executive. "All they want to do is create something for the moment, but where will that leave us in 10 to 15 years' time?"\par \par \uc2 In interviews with the Financial Times, big company bosses expressed anxiety that the febrile climate 14 months off a general election could drive investors away.\par \par \uc2 Much of their concern is focused on Ed Miliband, the Labour party leader, who has set himself up as champion of the "little guy" in pledging to freeze energy bills and criticising banks, housebuilders. insurance companies, betting groups and pension providers.\par \par \uc2 "I do feel that the prospect of Miliband gaining power on the basis of what he is saying is a dangerous thing, and very negative," said a leading FTSE chairman, though he added: "It is so difficult to know whether the rhetoric is reality."\par \par \uc2 Many are sore, too, about Labour's plan raise the top income tax rate from 45p to 50p. The party is heading towards the election with little big business support, though it has a better chance with smaller companies.\par \par \uc2 However, "political risk is not all on the Labour side", said a FTSE 100 chief in the finance sector. He criticised the coalition for a "debacle" over airport development, "terrible" inconsistency on energy subsidies and a "complete failure to deal with planning".\par \par \uc2 Others fear the Conservatives' \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  controls will hold back recovery by restricting the employment of people from outside the EU to meet skills shortages. Some are nervous about Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's plan for an EU membership referendum by 2017 - "an unnecessary risk", said one foreign investor.\par \par \uc2 A Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition is seen by some bosses as worse for them than a Labour government. "It could have a compounding effect," reinforcing anti-business tendencies on both sides, said a chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Another said that even if Nick Clegg, the right-leaning leader, and Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander remained at the top of the party, "they would not be in the ascendancy in a Lab-Lib coalition. It would be the Vince Cable-Simon Hughes faction."\par \par \uc2 One chairman worried about a coalition led by Mr Miliband and Mr Cable, saying the Lib Dem business secretary was "much more dangerous [than Mr Miliband]. He would want to do lots of the 'stop the rich' stuff, such as levying a mansion tax."\par \par \uc2 Many agree business has helped bring the hostile climate on itself. "Business has to think deeply about its role in society," said a FTSE boss in financial services. "A lot of companies have ignored the consumer."\par \par \uc2 Executives are trying to assess what a Labour victory would mean. Housebuilders say that since Mr Miliband's broadside against them for "hoarding" land, "the tone has been a lot less confrontational", in meetings with Labour's housing policy team.\par \par \uc2 Some FTSE bosses think, even if Mr Miliband lives up to his rhetoric, the markets will rein him in. "One thing that has changed since the 1970s is the global markets' speed of reaction," said a chairman. "In France, President Hollande has had to change course more rapidly than Mitterrand did."\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Andy Sharman\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140309ea39001b9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

\par\par \uc2 Business\par \b \uc2 Britain's man in a suitcase on a mission to double exports\b0\par\par\uc2 KIKI LOIZOU   \par \uc2 1,719 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 1; National\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 He lifted BT out of the doldrums and left it with a booming share price, but can Lord Livingston do a similar rescue job on Britain's overseas trade?\par \par \uc2 It's 7.30am in Warsaw. Beyond the walls of the British ambassador's home on the Vistula River it's bright and bitterly cold. Yet inside, Lord (Ian) Livingston, amped up on coffee and scrambled eggs, is simmering with energy.\par \par \uc2 The former chief executive of BT is only five months removed from chucking in his \u163\'00\'A39m-a-year job to take on the unpaid role of minister for trade and investment.\par \par \uc2 He has clearly lost none of the zeal he needed to whip the telecoms giant into shape; by the time he sits down to talk about UK plc he has already been up and working for two hours. But there are still things that take some getting used to in Livingston's new life of working for free.\par \par \uc2 "My son has just got a job with \uc2 Accenture\uc2 . He's now the family's biggest earner," he laughs. His daughter has just been offered a job with McKinsey. "They have to earn to look after their old man."\par \par \uc2 It was last June that David Cameron summoned the 49-year-old Scot to a meeting at No 10 to ask him to follow Lord (Stephen) Green, the former HSBC chairman who was in the role for almost three years. Three weeks later Livingston told BT he was leaving. The prime minister, he says, "is a good salesman". Ultimately, the lure of office was too great. "I've got an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  background," says Livingston, "and sometimes I think of what would have happened to my family if they hadn't moved to Britain. This is a chance to give something back."\par \par \uc2 He is about to set off on his first trade mission, not far from the town of Plotz, where his grandfather, a Polish Jew, was born. It's a whirlwind tour of eastern Europe, with 60 small companies and The Sunday Times in tow.\par \par \uc2 From Poland on to the Czech Republic, Slovakia and finally Hungary. Four countries in four days. In that sense the routine bears a striking resemblance to his old job. Yet success as a public servant is much less easily defined. During Livingston's five years at the top of BT, the company's share price shot up from 75p to more than 300p. He poured billions of pounds into fibre-optic broadband across Europe before buying football broadcast rights to launch BT Sport in an attempt to chip away at the dominance of \uc2 BSkyB\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Cameron is hoping his new minister can engineer a similar surge for the UK abroad. Expectations are high. In January, the chancellor set a target to get Britain exporting \u163\'00\'A31 trillion of goods and services by 2020. In 2013, exports were worth \u163\'00\'A3501.4bn, up 1.4% on the previous year.\par \par \uc2 A half a trillion pounds increase in seven years? "There's no point not being ambitious," Livingston deadpans.\par \par \uc2 He wants small and medium-sized companies to lead the revolution. This week he is championing underdogs such as Wensleydale Dairy Products and the Fine Bedding Company.\par \par \uc2 It may seem a lot to ask milk and mattresses to put the British economy back on its feet. Yet Livingston, a bundle of Scottish intensity, is unbowed.\par \par \uc2 He joined BT from Dixons, where, at 32, he became the youngest FTSE 100 finance director. Before that he worked at 3i, following a stint as a trainee accountant with Arthur Andersen.\par \par \uc2 Given half a chance, his inner numbercruncher bursts forth in flurries of figures, fractions and percentages. His middle-class Glaswegian accent thickens with excitement.\par \par \uc2 "The trade deficit has been reduced from \u163\'00\'A33bn to \u163\'00\'A31bn. If we can be worth 2% of China's imports, that could be halved. The CBI says mid-market companies could be worth \u163\'00\'A350bn of Britain's exports. Currently, one in six of them export, whereas one in three Italian firms do."\par \par \uc2 He exhales. And then he's off again. "What I'm saying is that there's a lot of opportunity. We need to look at what these customers, these countries, need. Then we need to find the British talent to solve their problems."\par \par \uc2 For Baron Livingston of Parkhead \u8212\'20\'14 he was ennobled last summer \u8212\'20\'14 that means a treadmill of glad-handing and back slapping, early starts, long speeches and a few oft-recycled jokes that, invariably, become lost in translation.\par \par \uc2 He memorises statistics and learns how to greet and toast in the lingo his foreign audiences will understand. He smiles a lot, retains eye-contact when conversing, and delivers speeches like he wants to punch the air with excitement.\par \par \uc2 It all seems rather exhausting. "There's no downtime," he chuckles. Nowadays he rarely has the chance to get to a home game at Celtic, where he is a nonexecutive director, and it's obvious he is missing football. He spends a while talking about Celtic's highlights and the time he sat in front of Billy Connolly, Susan Boyle and Rod Stewart.\par \par \uc2 But there's one memory that pains him more than any other. "When Paul Gascoigne scored for England [at Euro 96], I was sitting behind the goal," he says. "It's still one of the worst moments of my life."\par \par \uc2 When it comes to Scottish independence \u8212\'20\'14 as it invariably does \u8212\'20\'14 Livingston is firmly in the "no" camp. "My wife Debbie is English and we work better as one," he says, holding his head in shame at the joke.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot of Scottish businesses that feel threatened to speak up if they are anti-independence. It's disturbing," he says with a frown. "That's not how a democracy works. You can still be a proud Scot and be part of the United Kingdom. There would be a period when Scotland is not part of the EU which will affect free-trade agreements. That's why you have the likes of Standard Life expressing concern."\par \par \uc2 Next Livingston will head to Germany, then Israel, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada. He will visit 10 countries over 14 days and open some of the 40 British business centres for companies exploring foreign markets.\par \par \uc2 Everywhere he goes he will be wearing his \uc2 Marks & Spencer\uc2  suits with pride, as he did when he ran BT. Livingston has never been a spendthrift. He takes delight in the fact that his wedding anniversary is on February 15, allowing him to snap up cheap flowers after Valentine's Day.\par \par \uc2 Questions from audiences and foreign counterparts will start off light and predictable before he is unavoidably asked about his view on the tensions between Ukraine and Russia. "The priority is to do the right thing for Ukraine," he says, resorting to the diplomacy that comes with his duty. "Russia shouldn't be acting this way in the 21st century. Longer term there is a price to pay for this."\par \par \uc2 Russia is home to about 600 British companies and between 2009 and 2012 exports to the country grew by more than 75%, from \u163\'00\'A34.3bn to \u163\'00\'A37.6bn. "We have to avoid intensifying the issues."\par \par \uc2 Livingston softens when he talks about what he believes to be one of his biggest achievements. Five years ago, he gave BT staff the chance to invest up to \u163\'00\'A3225 a month in shares priced at 68p. More than 20,000 workers took up the offer.\par \par \uc2 "Those who did now have shares worth about \u163\'00\'A3100,000. Secretarial staff, drivers and engineers [are] paying off their mortgages \u8212\'20\'14 people write to me and say it's changed their lives. That means something and it reaches me here," he says, putting his hand to his chest.\par \par \uc2 It's no wonder that on his last day in September, the giant LED screen at the top of the BT Tower in central London read: "Thanks Ian".\par \par \uc2 During his last year as chief executive, he earned almost \u163\'00\'A39m in salary, bonuses and share incentives and still has shares stashed in a blind trust. "I don't know what my assets are. It was eye-wateringly expensive to transfer them. I hope the fund managers are doing a good job."\par \par \uc2 Now the minister must dash. He has a day full of meetings and speeches, briefings and tours. More importantly, he has a business plan he needs to execute. "It's one part strategy and nine parts execution. It's what I know. I may be part of government but I'm not sure I'll ever be a politician. I'm a businessman."\par \par \uc2 The life of Lord Livingston\par \par \uc2 VITAL STATISTICS\par \par \uc2 Born: July 28, 1964 Marital status: married with one son and one daughter School: Kelvinside Academy, Glasgow University: Manchester First job: trainee chartered accountant at Arthur Andersen Salary: unpaid Homes: Elstree, Hertfordshire, and a flat in Westminster Car: \uc2 Volkswagen\uc2  Golf Favourite book: Candide, by Voltaire Favourite film: Cool Hand Luke, starring Paul Newman Favourite music: Meatloaf Favourite gadget: iPad Last holiday: Canada Favourite charity: Jewish Care\par \par \uc2 WORKING DAY\par \par \uc2 The minister usually wakes at 5.30am and works at his flat in Westminster for an hour before walking to work, getting a coffee and porridge on the way. In a recent typical day in the capital Lord Livingston had meetings with London &Partners and the deputy mayor of London, several of his ministerial colleagues, and the Australian high commissioner. He also had a meeting with Japanese investors at 10 Downing Street, which he hosted with the prime minister. He is obliged to be in the Lords for voting.\par \par \uc2 A day in London is not that common, however. Livingston estimates that he spends 75% of his time outside the capital, either touring the country talking to businesses about exports, or overseas promoting Britain as a good place to invest in and do business from. His travel schedule for this month takes in 11 countries in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East and North America.\par \par \uc2 DOWNTIME\par \par \uc2 Livingston likes the theatre "but I don't have time to go", he says. He also like concerts. He saw Bruce Springsteen at the O2 and before that Rod Stewart, whom he knows from Celtic football club matches.\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140309ea39000jf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

\par\par \uc2 Editorial; Opinion, Columns\par \b \uc2 Spring is near: time, says the minister, to ethnically cleanse your house\b0\par\par\uc2 CAMILLA CAVENDISH   \par \uc2 1,220 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 1; National\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the metropolitan elite? Even those who can't afford the luxury of a Polish nanny may feel that last week's speech by the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister James Brokenshire was a little McCarthyite. Brokenshire attacked middle-class families who employ sparky foreigners instead of lumpish Brits. It's not reds under the beds that will get you into trouble: it's asking a red to make your bed.\par \par \uc2 It is true that the wealthy have enjoyed the benefits of hard-working tradesmen and staff from other countries without caring what effect they might be having on native Brits. Brokenshire could also have said that Labour members of this metropolitan bubble were deaf to public fury during their 13-year policy of uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . But declaring open season on every MP who asks a Colombian to do their hoovering won't do much to advance the debate. In Washington it has been open season on home helps for 20 years. In 1993 Nannygate swept away two of Bill Clinton's candidates for attorney-general. His first choice, Zoe Baird, had employed one illegal Peruvian as a nanny, another as a chauffeur, and paid no social security taxes for them at first. His next choice, Kimba Wood, had also employed an illegal alien and paid no tax. In the end the job went to Janet Reno, who was childless, so above suspicion.\par \par \uc2 With the British Nannygate, Brokenshire has leapt from the legitimate exposure of illegal employment into the homes of people employing legal migrants. Move over, Baroness Scotland, who was recently revealed to have hired (unknowingly) an illegal housekeeper. Now we know Dave and Sam Cameron had an Australian nanny (gasp). Nick Clegg employed a Belgian.\par \par \uc2 The government is not amused by this reminder from one of its own that we are governed by the metropolitan elite: there's quite enough of that coming from Labour already. And it is annoyed that the speech sowed more confusion about Tory policy in a week when data showed the government would miss its net migration target and the Home Office was accused of having exaggerated the extent to which migrants stop Brits getting jobs.\par \par \uc2 The question of whether foreigners are "taking our jobs" is a complex one. There is no fixed number of jobs to be divided up, because migrants help to expand the economy and increase the size of the pie. And it's common sense that employers will hire better and cheaper workers if they can. Analysis in 2012 by \uc2 the Migration Advisory Committee\uc2  suggested migrants depressed the job prospects of natives, especially the low-skilled. The new report finds less evidence of this, especially when the economy is strong. But it finds that it happens in times of recession and high \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It's hard to know what to make of this, since both reports contain caveats about the data.\par \par \uc2 Neither report deals with dislocation of workers who find it hard to get work locally. And displacement is only one side of the coin. Without high rates of migration, employers might have hired more unemployed Brits. High migration rates create the Pret a Manger paradox: a bias towards eager foreigners who don't need to be trained to be cheerful and who turn up on time.\par \par \uc2 If you want to do another impossible calculation, why not work out the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on the size of the economy against its social cost? For \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is about much more than economics: it is about values. Outsiders change the nature of the society they enter. Diversity brings new ideas, energy and understanding. But mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  also puts a strain on public services and makes it hard to build trust.\par \par \uc2 A fascinating report last week by the Centre for Entrepreneurs found the public feels positive about migrant entrepreneurs, who, it claims, have created one in seven of all new small companies in Britain. Some critics say it is hypocritical to praise foreign entrepreneurs who create jobs but to decry the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on social cohesion. Yet that is perfectly logical.\par \par \uc2 When Nigel Farage of UKIP says he feels like a foreigner in his own country, he is articulating views that polls have reflected for years. People fear the scale of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . And they know that as well as all the enterprising souls, Britain has also imported some groups whose practices are wholly antithetical to our way of life.\par \par \uc2 Talk to Jasvinder Sanghera about forced marriage. Listen to Fahma Mohamed on female genital mutilation, which is thought to have been carried out on 170,000 girls and women living in England and Wales in the past 10 years. Ask yourself why no one has been prosecuted for that crime or why no one even mentioned it for years. These are questions to which the business community and the liberal left have no answers.\par \par \uc2 Every modern country is facing similar problems, but various studies suggest Europe is worse at assimilation than the United States. American Pakistanis, for example, are generally richer and better integrated than their British counterparts. The United States has its problems, but it has been crafting a multi-ethnic society for generations with patriotism on the school curriculum. And, like Canada and Australia, it tends to hand out visas according to skills, not family ties.\par \par \uc2 After a decade of mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , Britain faces the challenge of building a more cohesive society. We need an American approach to values. And we need an Australian approach to talent. The Blair government planned what it dubbed "an Australian-style points system", but the clue was in the word "style". The lack of an overall cap made nonsense of the "points". The Australians target skills they believe they need more of. The Brits just divided them into five "tiers", and then let most people in anyway.\par \par \uc2 By cracking down on bogus colleges and reforming family visas, the coalition has helped to reduce the number of non-\uc2 European Union\uc2  arrivals by 70,000 this year. The problem is that there is an EU-shaped hole in government policy. The number of EU arrivals in the past year reached 212,000, more than double \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's target of curbing the figure to below 100,000 by the next election. Unless the EU changes its policies on free movement, Britain will eventually face a choice between staying in the EU and controlling who comes in.\par \par \uc2 The Institute of Directors says that we face a choice between closed borders and an open economy. That is nonsense. Multinationals can transfer as many talented executives here from overseas as they like. Only half the work permits set aside for skilled migrants have been taken up. When politicians and businessmen seek refuge in debates about GDP, they miss the point about the social cost. Equally, when a minister accuses law-abiding folk of hypocrisy, he creates unnecessary antagonism. A minister who wants you to ethnically cleanse your house because the government can't control EU \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is offering the wrong kind of nanny state.\par \par \uc2 camilla.cavendish@sunday-times.co.uk\par \par \uc2 WHEN THE \b \uc2 IMMIGRATION\b0 \uc2  MINISTER ACCUSES LAW-ABIDING FOLK OF HYPOCRISY HE CREATES UNNECESSARY ANTAGONISM\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140309ea39000q6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 NICK CLEGG wants to enshrine in law Britain's commitment to devote 7p of every \u163\'00\'A310 of national income to providing foreign aid.\par \par \uc2 The deputy prime minister is pressing for a bill in the next session of parliament to make the provision of 0.7% of gross national income to the international development budget legally binding.\par \par \uc2 The proposal, which the Liberal Democrat leader is discussing with \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 , the chancellor, will infuriate Conservative backbenchers who oppose the ring-fencing of the budget of the Department for International Development (DfID) when there are cuts across Whitehall.\par \par \uc2 While Cameron supports maintaining Britain's commitment to a UN aid target, he is wary of making it law, as it would cut the government's freedom to decide spending.\par \par \uc2 However, Lib Dem sources said any refusal by Cameron to back a bill would raise questions over his commitment to international aid funding.\par \par \uc2 Last year DfID met the 0.7% pledge but some Tories want its budget curbed or funds redirected to British projects. Meanwhile, despite enthusiasm from Osborne, the Tories have not been pushing their coalition partners to include a bill on an EU referendum in the Queen's Speech in June.\par \par \uc2 In an effort to portray himself as the defender of Britain's membership of the EU before May's European elections, Clegg yesterday attacked both Labour and the Tories on Europe and accused them of "panic" over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Answering questions at the Lib Dem spring conference, Clegg appeared to criticise a speech last week by James Brokenshire, the Tory \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, who suggested a wealthy metropolitan elite had benefited from cheap foreign labour. "Over the last 24 to 48 hours we have seen in many respects some of the most ugly sides of the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate," said Clegg.\par \par \uc2 He accused Labour of failing to stand up against xenophobia and of "losing the courage of their convictions".\par \par \uc2 In his keynote speech today, Clegg will launch a broadside at UKIP, which he will accuse of "ungenerous, backwards-looking politics".\par \par \uc2 In a thinly veiled reference to the UKIP leader Nigel Farage, Clegg will say: "The politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub."\par \par \uc2 He will accuse his coalition partners of "flirting with exit" from the EU and Labour of sitting on the fence. "Do you want Britain in Europe or out? That's the real question in May. One party wants out. Another is flirting with exit. The other lot don't have the courage of their convictions on this \u8212\'20\'14 they're saying nothing at all," he will say.\par \par \uc2 He will back EU reform but say Britain cannot demand changes in Brussels with "one foot out of the door".\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140309ea39000rj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A SENIOR Conservative MP has told white working-class families to "turn the telly off" because it is damaging their children's education.\par \par \uc2 Graham Stuart\uc2 , chairman of the Commons education committee, said children from poor white families were being held back at school because the television was left on constantly at home.\par \par \uc2 Stuart, who was educated at Glenalmond College, Perthshire, a private boarding school, made his remarks while taking evidence on the underachievement at school of children from white working-class families.\par \par \uc2 Stuart, who makes his two daughters do their homework and music practice before they watch television, said white working-class children could not concentrate on homework because the television was rarely off.\par \par \uc2 He said: "I am not trying to demonise people who leave the telly on if they do not know how damaging it is because no one tells them and [if] they do not know how important two hours' extra homework every fortnight is. If we do not challenge that then we are not serving those communities very well."\par \par \uc2 He said that doing homework with the television off was a key to success, pointing out that some poor children from ethnic minorities outperformed their white classmates because they worked hard. "We have got this race issue in here: there are some \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  communities in dire housing and dire poverty whose children do well because they work harder," Stuart said.\par \par \uc2 His remarks were criticised by Chris Williamson, Labour MP for Derby North, as "patronising". Williamson, a former bricklayer, said: "Television is part of our culture these days. This once again demonstrates how cut off these privileged members of the Conservative party are. It's not about whether kids are watching TV, it's about lack of opportunities."\par \par \uc2 Ian Mearns, Labour MP for Gateshead, who is part of the Commons inquiry, said it drives him "up the wall" that in his constituency "bright girls" all want to be hairdressers. "Places like Gateshead do not need 500 new hairdressers every year," he said. " There is a problem about aspirations among white working-class kids."\par \par \uc2 Push on and we'll all get a good school, Eleanor Mills, News Review, page 6\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140309ea39000rs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A millionaire who sued his old prep school over sexual abuse had no interest in compensation\par \par \uc2 One sunny afternoon in April 2012, a 45-yearold millionaire entrepreneur took a taxi through the gates of the prep school where he had been sexually abused by his English teacher.\par \par \uc2 It was the first time Nicholas Gibson had travelled through those gates for 32 years. He had never told anyone about the abuse. He found it so difficult to break his silence that he had been rehearsing for days what he would say to the current headmaster.\par \par \uc2 The school was Aldwickbury, a boys' prep on a grand country estate in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. Last week, its insurers awarded Gibson damages of \u163\'00\'A310,000, and all legal costs, in a civil action.\par \par \uc2 But he didn't want the money: he wanted an apology, which he still hasn't been given.\par \par \uc2 "The Catholic Church and the BBC have opened up [about historic abuse]," Gibson said. "Prep schools are in a state of denial."\par \par \uc2 Aldwickbury is the latest of more than 20 schools that are facing compensation claims following the Jimmy Savile scandal. Its alumni include the lyricist Sir Tim Rice. Other schools in the spotlight have educated establishment figures such as Boris Johnson, Nick Clegg and the actor Damian Lewis.\par \par \uc2 Gibson decided to take action while he was undergoing therapy after breaking up with a girlfriend (he has never married).\par \par \uc2 "The more I looked into my own story, the more I began to think that I needed some acknowledgement of what had happened to me," he said.\par \par \uc2 "I wanted to know if there had been other victims, who might have suffered worse than me and need help. I also thought, this guy could still be teaching, or working with kids."\par \par \uc2 Gibson is not easily daunted. He is an articulate, successful businessman who was educated at \uc2 Oxford University\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 where I first met him in 1987 \u8212\'20\'14 and went on to become a BBC journalist and a spokesman for the European Commission. He built a media business that he sold in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, he was terrified at the prospect of walking back into the school: "The idea of going to the new head and telling him grisly details of my first sexual experiences was frightening."\par \par \uc2 FOR two years, when he was 10 and 11, Gibson was taught English by a man called Mulcahy Brown. At least once a week, in a class of 20 boys, Brown would perch on his desk.\par \par \uc2 "He would come and stand close to me: I think he was keeping an eye on the door. He would offer me a sweet. He would put his hand down his trousers and start masturbating. Then he would put his hand down my trousers and stroke my penis."\par \par \uc2 Like many victims of this kind of abuse, Gibson was confused by his emotions. He knew the behaviour was wrong, but also felt that he was somehow to blame.\par \par \uc2 "It's ingrained in you that it's your fault, because you have this feeling that you are special, you are chosen. I remember Mr Brown sitting on the desks of others, and feeling jealous that he hadn't chosen me."\par \par \uc2 Even if he had thought of telling his parents, which he says he didn't, Gibson was left in no doubt of the consequences. One day, Brown pounced on another boy, kicking and punching him.\par \par \uc2 "He was screaming, 'Don't you ever snitch on me to your parents again', and I remember thinking, 'I'm glad he's not hitting me'."\par \par \uc2 Gibson is careful not to overdramatise.\par \par \uc2 "It wasn't rape. What happened to me is by no means the worst form of abuse. But it's very serious at that impressionable age."\par \par \uc2 All these feelings \u8212\'20\'14 that it could have been worse, that he was somehow responsible, but that he had to speak out \u8212\'20\'14 combined in Gibson's mind as he went up the long drive to meet Vernon Hales, current head of Aldwickbury School. He went there "in a spirit of co-operation".\par \par \uc2 He was glad that Hales listened sympathetically. But when he asked whether Brown was still teaching, or even still alive, the head said he could not help because of data protection issues.\par \par \uc2 Frustrated, Gibson tried to track down his old teacher himself. He discovered that a man with the same name had died \u8212\'20\'14 but without knowing his date of birth, he could not be sure it was the same person. He also knew that some child molesters change their names.\par \par \uc2 When the envelope arrived from the national records office, Gibson found himself unable to touch it for two weeks. "I wasn't sure if I wanted it to be him or not."\par \par \uc2 After a fortnight, he forced himself to open the letter. "I said to myself, 'You're 45, this was 35 years ago, you applied for this certificate: read it'. When I did, it was clear it was him. It listed his profession as teacher \u8212\'20\'14 retired. And then I knew that I hadn't wanted him to be dead. It gave me no sense of closure whatsoever."\par \par \uc2 Gibson calculates that there could be as many as 30 other victims. He told the school that Brown had died, and offered to help them to contact other possible victims.\par \par \uc2 He suggested the school put something on its website stressing that although the events were long over, the school was keen to be transparent and to offer counselling. At a meeting in October, the school governors seemed receptive. But in December, Gibson received what he calls "a very legal letter" from the chairman of governors.\par \par \uc2 The letter expressed deep sympathy for Gibson. It said the school had taken advice from solicitors, a forensic psychiatrist and the local authority. All three, it said, were "emphatic in advising against any attempt by the school to contact old boys. The school was advised that to follow that course of action would involve risk and that other old boys may not appreciate the intrusion of the school reminding them of any abuse which they may have suffered."\par \par \uc2 Gibson felt exasperated. "I think my anger was delayed. I began to suspect they were not acting properly. It was never about the money; nor was it ever about getting back at the school which gave me, in many ways, a wonderful education. It was about transparency. I don't hold them responsible for what happened to me, but I do hold them responsible for their reaction." After nine months of shuttling between England and his home in Brussels, he felt he had no choice but to turn to the law. In February 2013, he went to the police who, he says, were marvellous. Crucially, they told him that another person had made an allegation against Brown. This "was a liberation. For the first time in 30 years, I realised that maybe it wasn't my fault."\par \par \uc2 THERE was no one to prosecute, since Brown had died. So Gibson pursued a civil action and the school has settled.\par \par \uc2 "The lawyer called and told me we'd won. But I didn't have any sense of feeling I had won, I guess because there are no winners here. I didn't really want damages. What I wanted was for the school to acknowledge, apologise and reach out to others. And it would be a stronger school for doing so."\par \par \uc2 Why can Aldwickbury not take up this challenge? "We have expressed our sympathy emphatically," said Hales. "Any acts of that type are horrendous. We were never trying to hide anything. But you have to be very careful what you say in all circumstances. We reported the matter to the authorities but didn't write to the old boys, after taking advice."\par \par \uc2 Hales is right that schools have to be careful what they say. With some facing possible bankruptcy as the number of cases rises, apologising to victims who do not seek compensation should be attractive. But to issue an apology would open a legal can of worms.\par \par \uc2 "If a school apologised", said Alan Collins, of the law firm Slater & Gordon, "its insurers could say that this sets a precedent. It is often the insurers who are settling, not the schools, which have to be careful." A school that apologises without the support of its insurers could invalidate its policy.\par \par \uc2 The result is that victims have only two choices: to stay silent or to trudge through the courts. While Gibson does not want to let institutions off the hook, he thinks there should be an alternative channel for people like him, who seek only truth and reconciliation.\par \par \uc2 "What motivates the vast majority of victims of historical sexual abuse," he said, "is not financial compensation, but acknowledgment. Rather than get that, they are so often faced with obfuscation from the institutions they challenge, leaders hiding behind insurance companies who so often call the shots, and the principles of current child protection policies being ignored for cases of historical abuse."\par \par \uc2 On his radio show last month, Nick Clegg said transparency was society's best defence against abuse. The deputy prime minister praised the courage of Ian McFadyen, his former classmate at Caldicott prep school, whose allegations led to the recent conviction of teacher Roland Wright. Such courage "not only brings perpetrators to justice", Clegg said, "but it also brings it out into the open in a way where it has previously lurked in the shadows."\par \par \uc2 McFadyen is now lobbying for "mandatory reporting", which would make it a criminal offence for any teacher not to report suspected abuse to the police. Ministers fear \u8212\'20\'14 rightly, in my view \u8212\'20\'14 that this could blight innocent lives. But there should be an avenue for institutions to be transparent, rather than defensive. Gibson has found it very hard to speak about his experiences. But he does not regret it. "If people like me keep quiet", he said, "we will not know if other people suffered far, far more."\par \par \uc2 He hopes to use the damages he won to help provide counselling for other victims of historic abuse at prep schools. That, at least, is something positive.\par \par \uc2 Nicholas Gibson is not his real name. All other biographical details are correct.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 NICK CLEGG wants to enshrine in law Britain's commitment to devote 7p of every \u163\'00\'A310 of national income to providing foreign aid.\par \par \uc2 The deputy prime minister is pressing for a bill in the next session of parliament to make the provision of 0.7% of gross national income to the international development budget legally binding.\par \par \uc2 The proposal will infuriate Conservative backbenchers who oppose the ring-fencing of the budget of the Department for International Development (DfID) when there are cuts across Whitehall.\par \par \uc2 While Cameron supports maintaining Britain's commitment to a UN aid target, he is wary of making it law, as it would cut the government's freedom to decide spending. Last year DfID met the 0.7% pledge but some Tories want its budget curbed or funds redirected to British projects.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, despite enthusiasm from Osborne, the Tories have not been pushing their coalition partners to include a bill on an EU referendum in the Queen's Speech in June.\par \par \uc2 In an effort to portray himself as the defender of Britain's membership of the EU before May's European elections, Clegg yesterday attacked both Labour and the Tories on Europe and accused them of "panic" over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In a thinly veiled reference to the UKIP leader Nigel Farage, Clegg will say: "The politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub."\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140309ea3900108\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich38\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal570

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 LAST week the Education Secretary, who runs a school system in which selection by ability is actually illegal, got his daughter into one of the most selective schools in the world.\par \par \uc2 But have no fear. No rules were broken. Of course, the Grey Coat Hospital School does not select by ability. But, like several state schools used by the London elite, it selects in other ways and continues to have many features of the grammar school it used to be.\par \par \uc2 Tens of thousands of parents, disappointed in their choice of school on National Offer Day last week, could only dream of getting such a schooling for their children.\par \par \uc2 And yet Michael Gove was not criticised for this. He was praised.\par \par \uc2 'All credit to Michael Gove and his journalist wife, Sarah Vine, whose daughter has been awarded a place at Grey Coat Hospital, an academy school in the heart of Westminster,' simpered the Left-wing Independent, adding: 'He will be the first Conservative Secretary of State for Education to have a child at a state secondary school.'\par \par \uc2 Why would that be a good thing, you might ask? Why should we rejoice that Tory politicians are now taking to the same tricks that Labour hypocrites have used for years?\par \par \uc2 GREY Coat Hospital is an interesting place. It is totally unlike most state secondaries. It defies egalitarian dogma, and accepts educational wisdom, and so is open to girls only. Even without its religious requirements it is not simple to get into.\par \par \uc2 Its admissions rules go on for pages (I have posted them on my blog for anyone who wants to study them). You would have to be a mixture of Albert Einstein and St Thomas Aquinas to work out what they actually mean in practice.\par \par \uc2 Why is this sort of filtering allowed, while open, honest, straightforward selection by ability is against the law?\par \par \uc2 The school is one of several that are well-known to pushy and well-informed London Blairites, such as the Goves, who know paying school fees will damage their images. Others include Camden School for Girls, William Ellis, and (for Roman Catholics) the London Oratory and Cardinal Vaughan. It is amazing what such people will do (one New Labour power couple moved house at enormous cost) to wangle their young into these places, which more or less guarantee Oxbridge entry at the end.\par \par \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2 , now in the news for other reasons, also got a child into Grey Coat Hospital, back in 1998. Nobody praised her. 'Harman Snubs Local Comp for Top Girls School', said the Daily Mirror at the time and accurately called Grey Coat Hospital an 'elite' school.\par \par \uc2 The real question is why Mr Gove's daughter isn't going to a school her father has often praised to the heavens, his own local comprehensive. This is Burlington Danes Academy, a few minutes' walk from the Education Secretary's modest home.\par \par \uc2 AFTER all, both Mr Gove and the Prime Minister have ladled warm words over Burlington Danes and its head, Dame Sally Coates. Dame Sally, once invited to speak next to Mr Gove at a Tory conference, is shortly leaving for higher things, but surely such schools aren't wholly dependent on one charismatic head, are they?\par \par \uc2 In 2012 Mr Gove wrote a newspaper article in which he listed Burlington Danes among schools in which 'excellence is becoming a universal expectation, academic study a driving purpose'. Later that same year he numbered it among 'some superb state schools in disadvantaged areas generating fantastic results'. He said of these schools: 'They do much better in exams than many schools, including private schools, in leafy areas. Their students win places at Oxbridge on merit. All because their heads, from the moment any child arrives, refuse to accept excuses for under-performance.'\par \par \uc2 And Mr Cameron himself, in a speech in September 2011, commended Burlington Danes, saying it was doing much better than four out of five state schools in Surrey and Oxfordshire.\par \par \uc2 Could it be that these salesmen don't actually want to buy their own product? Could it be that they know in their hearts that their supposed school reforms, which they ceaselessly trumpet to us, are a mass of froth, oversold and boosted by dubious statistics?\par \par \uc2 Could it be that they know that single-sex selective schools, which they deny by law to nearly everyone else, are in fact better than failed, doomed comprehensives that can sometimes be dragged into shape by strong heads, only to sink back again to their former state?\par \par \uc2 If you want to know the answer, don't listen to what they say. Watch what they do.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 WHAT ARE THEY REALLY AIMING AT?LEFT-WING warmongers, who badly want some sort of conflict with Russia over Ukraine, are a mass of contradictions. They say they're in favour of 'democracy', when in fact they are apologists for a naked coup d'etat against an elected government by an armed mob.They say they are against interference in other countries, when they excuse the blatant intervention of foreign politicians on the side of the Kiev rabble.They say that Crimea has no right to secede from Ukraine, when they all supported the secession of Kosovo from Serbia. They say they are concerned about Mr Putin's undoubtedly squalid and dishonest government. But they never complain about China, which is far more repressive and which is now trampling on the national independence of its imperial conquests in Tibet and Sinkiang. When someone's not consistent, they're not telling you their real motives. Interestingly, most of the people who hate Russia also love the EU, and hate this country's independence and traditions. That might give you a clue as to what sort of people they really are - and explain why I sympathise with Russia. \u160\'00\'A0 WHAT is it about Boris Johnson? Why do Tories like him, and think he might be any better than Mr Cameron?\u160\'00\'A0 His politics are as liberal as his private life. He's soft on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . He's fundamentally keen on the EU (and Turkish membership of it). He offers no hope of real change or relief.And he's not even called Boris - it is his middle name, which he uses as a sort of stage name, like 'Sting' or 'Bono'. His family call him 'Al'. It's a mystery. LOCKING UP OUR LIBERTYANYONE who really understands English freedom knows that jury trial is the most important safeguard we have - against corrupt police, against bullying officials and over-mighty government. Quite simply, it stops the State locking people up because it doesn't like them.Now, coincidentally choosing a week in which everyone is otherwise engaged, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, says he\u160\'00\'A0 wants to scrap the right to trial by jury for many 'minor' offences. They're not 'minor' if you're falsely convicted of them, Lord Thomas. Don't let him do it.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Mail On Sunday\par \par \uc2 Document MOSM000020140309ea3900011\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich38\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal570

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 DAVE'S ANSWER TO THE \uc2 IMMIGRATION\uc2  ROW? FIND A NEW PLANET; IN THE CORRIDORS OF POWER\b0\par\par\uc2 BY JAMES FORSYTH   \par \uc2 1,120 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Mail on Sunday\par \uc2 MOSM\par 39\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 THE Tory Party is in a mess over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . But the car crash that was \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister James Brokenshire's speech last week - which landed the Camerons' Nepalese nanny on the front pages - revealed far more than that.\par \par \uc2 No 10 has been fretting that net migration will be higher by the Election than it was in 2010. This is a major liability for the Tories, with UKIP poised to exploit voters' concerns.\par \par \uc2 It is migration from other EU countries that is pushing up the figures, and UKIP's answer is simple: leave the EU. It is, as one Tory Cabinet Minister says, 'their USP'. The Tories, under their present leadership, are never going to be able to match that.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , though, has not helped his cause with his poor choice for the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  job. When Mark Harper resigned from the post last month because his cleaner was working in the UK illegally, Cameron - who tries to avoid reshuffles wherever possible - bumped up underwhelming Home Office Minister Brokenshire. This approach may have saved time but it has come at a high political cost.\par \par \uc2 It has infuriated Ministers who are normally loyal allies. One complains: '\b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is one of the four big subjects for the next year. You need to put a grown-up there.'\par \par \uc2 But instead, Cameron promoted Brokenshire, a Minister with a tin ear for politics, who has embarrassed himself and his party by pinning the blame for rising \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on well-off families who hire foreign nannies or cleaners.\par \par \uc2 One Minister fumes: 'To lay into the middle classes is just bonkers'. And a No 10 source remarks: 'There should be a function in \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  Word that deletes your speech when you start writing about a metropolitan elite.'\par \par \uc2 No 10 itself, though, can't escape some of the blame for the fall-out from the speech. Someone in No 10 should have realised that questions were bound to follow about whether Cameron and the rest of the Tory Cabinet had ever employed a foreign nanny, cleaning lady or builders.\par \par \uc2 But there was little chance of that realisation being made when relations between No 10 and the Home Office remain dire. There is a lack of trust between Cameron's people and the Theresa May camp, whom they suspect of being keener to advance the Home Secretary's interests than the Government's.\par \par \uc2 The Tories need to get the focus back on to the economy. This week, they will emphasise how Britain's excellence in science and technology will create the high-paying jobs of the future. As part of this, the Government is to boldly go where no \uc2 British Government\uc2  has gone before - by announcing support for a mission to find undiscovered planets.\par \par \uc2 David Willetts, the Science Minister, will praise the building of a satellite and telescope designed to detect them. The mission might seem a bit out of this world, but it will boost British engineering and our rapidly growing space industry.\par \par \uc2 Back on Earth, the PM needs to turn his telescope to the flaws that the past few days have laid bare in his operation. If he is to win the Election, he needs everything to go right. He can't afford more weeks like this past one.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0GOVE PUSHES THE BENEFITS OF TRUANCY PLANTHE next Tory manifesto will, I understand, propose docking child benefit from parents whose children play truant. The proposal is being pushed by Education Secretary Michael Gove.David Cameron likes to joke that he has a book of things the Lib Dems have stopped him doing which will form the basis of his next manifesto. This plan is a classic example. It was proposed two years ago with support from No?10 and Gove - but was vetoed by Nick Clegg. It appeals to the Tories because of the sense that if you receive something from the State you have obligations in return - in this case, to get your child to school.At the top of the party, some favour making a detailed policy manifesto, while others, including Policy Minister Oliver Letwin, want a broader brush approach to maximise room for manoeuvre. Either way, they'll need big-ticket items to show what a Tory-only Government would be like. Expect the truancy idea to be one of them. \u160\'00\'A0STARS KEPT WAITING - THANKS TO THE PM'S 'OTHER WOMAN'THERE was an array of impressive women in Downing Street on Thursday night for a reception linked to International Women's Day. There was Winter Olympics gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold, chef Lorraine Pascale, a host of businesswomen and actress Helena Bonham Carter. But as time ticked on, there was no Prime Minister. He was stuck in Brussels at a summit.Home Secretary Theresa May had to step in, thanking guests for coming and telling them that \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  would be along as soon as he could.When Cameron did finally make it, he tried to explain his lateness in reference to two powerful females. He quipped that he didn't want to miss the reception as the most important woman in his life, wife Samantha, was there.But he was running late because of 'another quite powerful force in my life' - German Chancellor \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2 , who had been holding forth at the summit.Indeed, Cameron is off to see Merkel again today - he will have supper with her after they open a technology fair in Hanover.The meeting comes just ten days after her visit to London. There's little doubt that Merkel is the most important foreign leader in Cameron's life.NEXT year, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  is set to become the first Tory Prime Minister in the modern era to send his child to a state secondary school. No?10 won't be drawn on Cameron's plans for the education of his children, but those close to the family are clear that he will follow the lead of Michael Gove and keep his daughter Nancy in the state sector.At the moment, Nancy is at the same Church of England state primary school as Gove's daughter, but she is a year younger. That means that in 12 months' time, it will be the Camerons waiting to see where their daughter has been offered a place.Cameron has always said that while he would prefer state schools, he would decide as a 'parent not a politician'. There is, however, no getting away from the political resonance of his decision. It will be a reminder of his personal commitment to public services and that he's a different kind of Tory.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Mail On Sunday\par \par \uc2 Document MOSM000020140309ea3900013\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich38\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal570

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Young pretender Alexander in power struggle with Cable over who succeeds Clegg as leader\par \par \uc2 BY SIMON WALTERS AND BRENDAN CARLIN\par \par \uc2 LIBERAL Democrat Cabinet Minister Danny Alexander was accused last night of positioning himself to succeed Nick Clegg after he appeared to initiate a power struggle with Vince Cable.\par \par \uc2 Business Secretary Mr Cable is furious that Treasury Chief Secretary Mr Alexander is demanding to be the party's main economic spokesman at next year's General Election.\par \par \uc2 Lib Dem MPs have accused Mr Alexander, 41, of using the issue to further his ambition of taking over in the event that the party flops at the polls and Mr Clegg is forced to resign.\par \par \uc2 Colleagues believe that Mr Cable still harbours leadership ambitions. He regrets not standing against Mr Clegg in 2007, but opponents say that he has left it too late.\par \par \uc2 At 70, Mr Cable is nearly 30 years older than Mr Alexander. There is an even bigger gulf in their politics.\par \par \uc2 Mr Alexander is a robust ally of Chancellor \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  and was recently embarrassed by a Tory MP's suggestion that he had abandoned his Lib Dem roots and 'gone native' since joining the Treasury.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, Mr Cable has attacked Mr Osborne's 'austerity' cuts, led demands for a mansion tax and applauded the rise in \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At the Lib Dem spring conference in York yesterday, Mr Alexander took to the stage to say that, if the party is still in power after the Election, he will raise the annual income tax personal allowance from \u163\'00\'A310,000 to \u163\'00\'A312,500.\par \par \uc2 And in an apparent attempt to rebuff claims that he is too close to the Tories, Mr Alexander told activists that the Lib Dems had fought the Conservatives to provide tax cuts for working people.\par \par \uc2 He boasted that Mr Clegg had already picked him to lead the Lib Dem team which will, if necessary, conduct fresh coalition talks with the Tories.\par \par \uc2 But on Friday, Mr Cable won a standing ovation from Lib Dem supporters in York after making a passionate speech about his political roots.\par \par \uc2 The Vince-versus-Danny feud threatens to overshadow Mr Clegg's attempts to portray the Lib Dems as Britain's only genuine pro-Brussels party and stave off humiliation at European elections in May.\par \par \uc2 One Lib Dem MP said: 'It's obvious that Danny's now on manoeuvres and sees himself as a future leader. He's positioning himself as Clegg's replacement if we come unstuck at the Election.\par \par \uc2 'He knows he has been damaged by claims that he is \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 's patsy but it will take more than a couple of speeches on cutting tax for the low-paid to change that.\par \par \uc2 'No one denies that Vince went through a bad patch last year, when he seemed to lose his touch. But he is back in the game and has not given up hope of getting the leadership.'\par \par \uc2 A Lib Dem peer said: 'Vince is a household name and widely respected. No one has ever heard of Danny Alexander.'\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Mail On Sunday\par \par \uc2 Document MOSM000020140309ea390001a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NEWS\par \b \uc2 Boris Johnson and \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  told to 'get back in their box and stop fighting'; Tory leadership campaign will only happen if Ed Miliband becomes PM, Cabinet minister warns, as allies of Chancellor and Mayor of London jockey to succeed \uc2 David Cameron\b0\par\par\uc2 By Tim Ross Political Correspondent   \par \uc2 791 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 07:40\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Boris Johnson and \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  have been told to \u8220\'20\'1Cget back in their box" and stop jostling for position to succeed \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  as leader of the Conservative Party.\par \par \uc2 A furious Cabinet minister warned colleagues who are plotting to become party leader that they are making it more likely that Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, will enter Number 10 at next year\u8217\'20\'19s election.\par \par \uc2 The senior Tory, speaking on condition of anonymity, attacked those allies of figures, including the Chancellor and the Mayor of London, who have been fuelling the debate over who should be the next party leader, as \u8220\'20\'1Csilly and unhelpful".\par \par \uc2 The appeal for unity at the top of the Conservative Party follows a week in which Mr Johnson\u8217\'20\'19s aides accused Mr Osborne of mounting a \u8220\'20\'1Cdirty tricks" campaign intended to undermine the popular London Mayor\u8217\'20\'19s hopes of leading the party.\par \par \uc2 Mr Osborne, who two years ago appeared unlikely to stand for the leadership himself, is now regarded at Westminster as firmly back in the running to succeed Mr Cameron, as the economy has improved.\par \par \uc2 Mr Johnson has attempted to give the impression that he will not stand for Parliament in next year\u8217\'20\'19s election but commentators have pointed out that he has failed categorically to rule it out.\par \par \uc2 Even the most senior figures in the Conservative Party do not know whether Mr Johnson will stand to become an MP, while sources who know him well say that he is determined one day to lead the party. Mr Johnson\u8217\'20\'19s term as London Mayor is due to continue until 2016.\par \par \uc2 The Cabinet minister said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe people doing this need to get back in their box.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhether you\u8217\'20\'19re Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s number one fan or number one hater, the only way any of these people can become leader is if Ed Miliband is Prime Minister. We should all be working to stop that, and this sort of thing is silly and unhelpful."\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron is expected to face discontent from his backbench MPs later this year when the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  elections are held.\par \par \uc2 If the Conservatives lose the General Election in May 2015, Mr Cameron would be expected to quit as party leader, triggering a contest among leading MPs.\par \par \uc2 Mr Johnson would need to be an MP at that point in order to stand a realistic chance of being elected leader. There have been suggestions that a number of possible seats could be made available for a by-election allowing Mr Johnson to return to the Commons, if does not stand as a candidate for the General Election in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Last week, Mr Osborne was reported to have personally urged Mr Johnson to stand for Parliament in next year\u8217\'20\'19s election so that the Mayor is fully tied to the result and cannot claim to be the \u8220\'20\'1Cchange" candidate for the leadership if the Tories lose.\par \par \uc2 It was said that the Chancellor was attempting to call Mr Johnson\u8217\'20\'19s bluff and ensure that he was personally as implicated in the party\u8217\'20\'19s success or failure at next year\u8217\'20\'19s poll as any other senior Tories.\par \par \uc2 The Mayor\u8217\'20\'19s supporters immediately hit back, denying suggestions that Mr Osborne had suggested he should stand for Parliament and insisting that the mayoral term lasted until 2016.\par \par \uc2 Some of Mr Johnson\u8217\'20\'19s allies claimed supporters of Mr Osborne and Mr Cameron were deliberately attempting to \u8220\'20\'1Cdestabilise Boris" by making sure he \u8220\'20\'1Cgets as much flak as they do" if the Tories lose next year.\par \par \uc2 Lynton Crosby, the Australian election strategist who helped Mr Johnson win two terms as Mayor of London, is now in charge of Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s Conservative general election campaign.\par \par \uc2 He is credited with bringing greater discipline to the Tory message during the past year but is unlikely to be impressed with the renewed leadership speculation.\par \par \uc2 Mr Crosby has sought to focus on core issues which will resonate with voters in the run up to the 2015 election, including the economy, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , and \uc2 European Union\uc2  reform.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron will travel to Germany tomorrow for fresh talks with \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2 , the German Chancellor, over changing the way the EU works. Mrs Merkel visited London last month, where she addressed both Houses of Parliament, had lunch in Downing Street and tea with the Queen.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron will co-host a computer technology trade fair in Hanover with Mrs Merkel before the pair hold discussions over the Ukraine crisis and the EU during dinner.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140309ea39002be\par }\par \b \uc2 Search
