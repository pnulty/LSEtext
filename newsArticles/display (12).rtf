\par\par \uc2 Editorial; Opinion, Columns\par \b \uc2 Negative tactics show Ukip has got its rivals rattled\b0\par\par\uc2 Leo McKinstry   \par \uc2 883 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Express\par \uc2 THEEXP\par \uc2 1; National\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Express Newspapers   \par \par \uc2 THE surge in support for Ukip continues to gather momentum. Amid mounting public disillusion with the progressive ruling elite, Nigel Farage's party is on the verge of causing one of the biggest upsets in politics since the Second World War.\par \par \uc2 An opinion poll at the weekend showed that 31 per cent of people are planning to vote Ukip in next month's European elections, well ahead of both Labour and the Conservatives.\par \par \uc2 This dramatic rise in popularity is remarkable for a party without a single seat at Westminster. But Ukip's growing appeal is a graphic indicator of widespread fury at the betrayal of our country by a narrow, selfserving political elite that has systematically undermined our national identity and allowed the EU to trash our democracy.\par \par \uc2 The further that Ukip advance the more rattled the political establishment becomes. A mood of hysteria and desperation has gripped the three main parties and large sections of the media as they try to halt Farage. Rational argument has been replaced by a form of McCarthyism, policy debate by puerile insults.\par \par \uc2 So we are told that Ukip's campaign posters, spelling out the disastrous impact of uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , are "racist". Similarly, a phoney storm is being generated by people dredging up online comments by even the most obscure Ukip members on social media sites.\par \par \uc2 In this climate of witch hunting and guilt by association, any controversial remark or dodgy behaviour by a Ukip supporter is paraded as representative of the party as a whole.\par \par \uc2 BUT these negative, mud\u8211\'20\'13slinging tactics have backfired spectacularly. The onslaught has only enhanced the rise of Ukip, as this weekend's figures demonstrate. This is because most Britons see through all the synthetic indignation.\par \par \uc2 Throwing about accusations of "racism" has long been the nasty tactic used by progressives to enforce their twin ideologies of mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and cultural diversity. The acceptance of these two creeds was never put to a democratic vote of the British people.\par \par \uc2 Instead the establishment ruthlessly imposed them by bullying opponents into silence and presenting any alternative viewpoint as "offensive".\par \par \uc2 That attitude was perfectly encapsulated by the notorious outburst from \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  during the 2010 general election when he branded Rochdale voter Gillian Duffy as "just a bigoted woman" for daring to voice her concern about uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . However much of the public is fed up at this suppression of dissent.\par \par \uc2 Increasing numbers of electors now find it intolerable to be treated as racists simply for loving their country, or for being alarmed at the social revolution that has engulfed Britain over the last decade.\par \par \uc2 The attempt to portray Ukip as socially unacceptable has only succeeded in reinforcing the potency of Farage's message: that he wants to regain our liberty from the anti\u8211\'20\'13British, pro\u8211\'20\'13EU political class that holds the very concepts of free speech, nationhood and democracy in contempt.\par \par \uc2 Ukip's surge is a quintessentially British rebellion against the thought police, the race relations commissars, the diversity doctrinaires and EU propagandists. The establishment's anti\u8211\'20\'13Ukip efforts also exude the foulest stench of hypocrisy. For the party's supposed sins of unfortunate expression or poor administration pale beside the activities of the incumbents at Westminster and Brussels.\par \par \uc2 Farage's critics bleat about his claims for office allowances but Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems were entirely responsible for the outrageous expenses scandal, which saw a host of MPs sent to prison. The most recent to end up behind bars was Denis MacShane, the fanatically pro\u8211\'20\'13EU MP for Rotherham.\par \par \uc2 IT was not Ukip that presided over the financial crisis, or sent British troops to die in Iraq and Afghanistan, or produced a dodgy dossier to justify an illegal war or squandered billions on aid for corrupt regimes.\par \par \uc2 It was not Ukip that colluded in the long\u8211\'20\'13term cover\u8211\'20\'13up of the paedophilia of the late Lib Dem MP Sir Cyril Smith. It is the EU, not Ukip, whose accounts have failed to be given a clean bill of health for 18 years by auditors because of serial abuses and mismanagement.\par \par \uc2 Imagine the thunderous outcry if Nigel Farage had been a leading officer in an organisation that was linked to a child abusers' support network. But that is the reported record of \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2 , Labour's deputy leader, and her husband Jack Dromey, the shadow local government minister. During the 1970s both were senior figures in the \uc2 National Council for Civil Liberties\uc2 , to which the sinister Paedophile Information Exchange was affiliated.\par \par \uc2 We have heard a lot about explosive comments from Ukip members on social media but let us remember that Labour's Diane Abbott has arguably made racially charged remarks about "blonde, blue\u8211\'20\'13eyed" Finnish nurses taking jobs at her local hospital and about her belief that "white people love to play divide and rule".\par \par \uc2 The great irony of Ukip is that it owes its success to the political establishment. If the main parties had not derided the views of the people for so long, especially on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and the EU, then Farage's party would never have gained ground.\par \par \uc2 The establishment is about to pay a heavy and deserved price for that disdain.\par \par \uc2 'Britons see through synthetic indignation'\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140428ea4s00041\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 William Hague: Ukip would be a disaster for the London economy\b0\par\par\uc2 1,054 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2014\par 14:02\par \uc2 London Evening Standard Online\par \uc2 NSONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited.   \par \par \uc2 A party whose MEPs are only in Brussels to \u8216\'20\'18have fun\u8217\'20\'19 are incapable of delivering the EU referendum we need\par \par \uc2 As I know from personal experience, many people think that the European elections are a chance to send a message of frustration, if they\u8217\'20\'19re worth bothering with at all. In 1999 the Conservatives thrashed Labour in the European elections on a low turnout. It was electorally the high point of my time leading the Conservative Party.\par \par \uc2 Two years later, at the general election, the boot was on the other foot and Labour defeated us anyway.\par \par \uc2 But since then, as treaty after treaty has been signed, the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s powers have grown enormously. On many of the issues where decisions in the EU decide much of what happens here \u8212\'20\'14 business regulation, the environment, free movement in the EU and more \u8212\'20\'14 members of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  have as much say as EU governments. So how and whether you vote on May 22 will make a real difference.\par \par \uc2 Labour and the Liberal Democrats say that Europe is working just fine, that nothing can or should be changed and that the British people certainly shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be given a say.\par \par \uc2 Ukip cannot deliver the referendum on Europe they say they want; they will not even try to keep what works and change what doesn\u8217\'20\'19t.\par \par \uc2 I completely disagree with such all-or-nothing views on Europe.\par \par \uc2 Many in Britain feel that the EU has been heading in a direction we never signed up to, that we have lost too much control of our own affairs. I think they\u8217\'20\'19re right. Every survey of public and business opinion shows that what most people want is for Britain to remain in the EU but under a better deal, and people want to have the right to decide Britain\u8217\'20\'19s future for themselves.\par \par \uc2 That is exactly what the Conservatives stand for on Europe: our plan is reform, renegotiation and a referendum. Our goal is a new settlement in Europe but whatever the outcome of the negotiations the decision to stay in the EU or leave altogether will be put to the British people in a referendum by the end of 2017.\par \par \uc2 We will hold to our plan on Europe with the same determination as with our long-term economic plan to build a stronger, more competitive United Kingdom. That has meant taking and sticking to difficult decisions but we are now seeing the fruits: the deficit down, welfare capped, 1.6 million new jobs and 400,000 new businesses and an income tax cut for 25 million people.\par \par \uc2 Some say no change is possible in Europe but we have a record that proves otherwise. People said you could never cut the EU budget but we did, saving British taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds a year. People said we could never get out of eurozone bail-outs, but we did. People said you could never reform the disastrous fisheries policy but we did.\par \par \uc2 We have done more: cutting red tape for small business and new free-trade deals beyond the EU that are boosting British exports. We are fixing our \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system, limiting migrants\u8217\'20\'19 access to benefits and increasing fines on companies that pay less than the minimum wage.\par \par \uc2 In our negotiations for a new deal in Europe we want to go much further: end the obligation to sign up to an \u8220\'20\'1Cever-closer union\u8221\'20\'1D in Europe, better democratic accountability with more powers for national parliaments so that power can flow back from Brussels, tighten further measures on benefit tourism, open up new markets for British businesses by expanding the Single Market in digital and service industries, and cut red tape further.\par \par \uc2 This is an ambitious agenda but our record proves we can do it. London has some great Conservative MEPs \u8212\'20\'14 Charles Tannock, Marina Yannakoudakis and Syed Kamall. We need the best possible team to strengthen our hand in negotiations and help us deliver.\par \par \uc2 These elections matter particularly for London: it is the heart of Europe\u8217\'20\'19s financial and services industries. But there are always global competitors out for London\u8217\'20\'19s business, whether New York or Singapore. We have successfully worked to protect the UK from EU laws that would have damaged our competitiveness \u8212\'20\'14 but we need good MEPs there to help us fight our corner.\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s where Ukip is a real problem. It isn\u8217\'20\'19t just that they say one thing and then another, making it up as they go along \u8212\'20\'14 one day calling for cuts to the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and pensions, the next calling for more spending. It\u8217\'20\'19s that they don\u8217\'20\'19t turn up in Brussels when they\u8217\'20\'19re needed and when they do, they don\u8217\'20\'19t stand up for Britain.\par \par \uc2 They even managed to vote against cutting the EU budget. In their own words, Ukip say they \u8220\'20\'1Ccan\u8217\'20\'19t change a thing in Europe\u8221\'20\'1D but are there to \u8220\'20\'1Chave some fun\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 People say Ukip are a one-man band and it\u8217\'20\'19s worth thinking about what that means. Nigel Farage says President Putin is the world leader he admires most. This is at a time when Russia has been isolated at the United Nations and tried to settle disputes with a neighbour through military force.\par \par \uc2 He goes further and claims President Assad was not responsible for the poison gas attack last year that killed hundreds of men, women and children in Damascus. It is a claim made in the face of all the evidence. It is a claim made only by Assad himself, the Kremlin, the Iranian government and precious few others \u8212\'20\'14 a telling choice of company. Yet that is the view Ukip MEPs will be representing on Britain\u8217\'20\'19s behalf in Europe.\par \par \uc2 The choice every voter will have on May 22 is who they want to stand up for Britain\u8217\'20\'19s interests in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 . With our record and our plan, I am confident that the Conservative Party can achieve real change in the EU, a reformed Europe that merits Britain\u8217\'20\'19s membership. But above all the British people must have the straight choice in a referendum whether to stay in the EU or leave. To deliver that referendum we need voters\u8217\'20\'19 support. I hope you will give it to us.\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140430ea4s0003s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

Their concerns include:\par \par \uc2 The route passes under the Queen\u8217\'20\'19s Park Estate area which includes properties with a history of structural problems which \u8220\'20\'1Ccould experience noise, vibration and subsidence problems\u8221\'20\'1D. The council wants the route realigned to the north so that it passes under the existing West Coast Main Line.\par \par \uc2 An assessment of the impact on Euston station as a terminus for HS2 focuses on additional journey times rather than \u8220\'20\'1Cpassenger overcrowding\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Related stories\par \par \uc2 The visual impact of a ventilation shaft and an auto-transformer station at the junction of Salusbury Road and Kilburn Lane.\par \par \uc2 The objections were being considered as Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin warned that commuters to London will have to queue at railway stations for a train to work if a new high speed rail line is not built.\par \par \uc2 The Cabinet minister is trying to head off a damaging Commons revolt today by Tory MPs against the proposed HS2 line.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEven on moderate forecasts, services will be increasingly full by the mid-2020s,\u8221\'20\'1D he was set to say.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf we don\u8217\'20\'19t create extra capacity, people at stations such as Milton\u160\'00\'A0 Keynes and Northampton will have to queue to get on a train to get to work.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr McLoughlin was also set to argue that London and the South-East are \u8220\'20\'1Cincreasingly full\u8221\'20\'1D, so more growth is needed in other regions to rebalance Britain\u8217\'20\'19s economy.\par \par \uc2 But his comments risked sparking a fresh debate about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , public services, housing, transport congestion and pollution. Dozens of Conservative MPs are set to rebel today against HS2, with some ministers with constituencies along the line expected to be absent for the vote, including Europe minister David Lidington who is on a visit to Estonia.\par \par \uc2 Former Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan, a leading opponent of the line, called on MPs to defend their constituents\u8217\'20\'19 interests.\par \par \uc2 And former Tory whip Michael Fabricant claimed that between 80 and 100 of his fellow MPs had \u8220\'20\'1Creally serious doubts\u8221\'20\'1D about HS2.\par \par \uc2 The Bill is set to clear its second reading with support from Labour.\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140430ea4s0002i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Few people really know how EU law works, but getting to grips with it would be a boost to your career\par \par \uc2 Is the UK on the brink of a retreat from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  (EU)? For law students who struggle to get to grips with complex EU law the thought of having it knocked off the syllabus might seem positive.\par \par \uc2 Few people, including law students, really get to grips with how EU law works as it can differ so much from our own laws and systems.\par \par \uc2 But far more likely than retreating from the EU, the UK will most likely either retain the same terms or renegotiate its membership. Law students will probably have to go on tackling a subject that has developed hugely since the 1970s.\par \par \uc2 Studying EU law is a commitment - there is a great deal of reading to do and you have to learn lots of case law with usually long, tricky names to remember. Yet it's worth being thorough about it as EU law influences a broad spectrum of our current laws, across both private and public practice in the UK.\par \par \uc2 In fact there is almost no area of domestic law that does not touch EU law \u8211\'20\'13 from tax to social welfare - so if you're interested in becoming a lawyer after your studies, you will not be at a serious disadvantage if you plan to rely on being purely a domestic lawyer.\par \par \uc2 My EU law teacher repeatedly said that sloppy students don't get to terms with the general workings of the EU court systems quickly enough and often became confused later down the line. Spending time learning the practical aspects of the subject, including familiarising yourself with the set of institutions and how they function, will serve you well. You'll need to understand the division of powers, the way cases are managed and how decisions are made.\par \par \uc2 One common error students make is assuming cases are brought directly by individuals before the European courts \u8211\'20\'13 actually the correct venue is more commonly via a national court.\par \par \uc2 For aspiring lawyers, being able to work within the EU should be looked at favourably. Lawyers consider it to be business as usual. The EU is a serious world power \u8211\'20\'13 it has a population of half a billion people, generating \u163\'00\'A3211 billion in exports and 4.2 million jobs for the UK.\par \par \uc2 This makes it an exciting and dynamic environment to work in with greater prospects than working just in the UK.\par \par \uc2 The potential conflicts of the economic policies of the EU and the political-social values of member states create the perfect environment for debate. EU lawyers negotiate on hot topics such as freedom, security and justice that involve harmonising policies on crime, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and asylum and raises human rights issues.\par \par \uc2 As people are more mobile and technology is developing quickly, dealing with legislation at a European level is important.\par \par \uc2 UK law firms have benefitted from belonging to a system that enables lawyers to practice within other member states on easy terms. Law students may want to apply to a firm that offers temporary or permanent placements at branches in other EU states to experience working abroad.\par \par \uc2 So those law students casting an absent-eye on EU law and legal systems, hoping that passing the exam will be enough, cast your eye again and see what EU law can offer you.\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140429ea4s000eh\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 You canopy parking there!

This was three percentage points higher than Labour and well ahead of the Tories on 19 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 9 per cent.\par \par \uc2 It indicates that Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s fortunes have not been hampered by its week of gaffes.\par \par \uc2 Last week, builder Andre Lampitt, who starred in a party broadcast, was suspended after tweeting criticism of Islam and Nigerians.\par \par \uc2 Scroll down for videos\par \par \uc2 It also emerged that a \u8216\'20\'18British builder\u8217\'20\'19 featuring in an election poster about cheap foreign labour was actually an Irish actor.\par \par \uc2 And an ordinary voter featured in the Ukip manifesto turned out to be party worker Lizzy Vaid.\par \par \uc2 At the weekend, Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott accused Ukip of being the \u8216\'20\'18BNP in blazers\u8217\'20\'19 \u8211\'20\'13 after an analysis of Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s political posters showed startling similarities withadverts put out by the far-Right BNP. It also emerged that William Henwood, who is standing for Ukip in Enfield, north London, had sent a tweet about Lenny Henry saying: \u8216\'20\'18He should emigrate to a black country. He does not have to live with whites.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 His comments came after Henry said there should be more people from ethnic minorities on TV.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio Five Live: \u8216\'20\'18I do think those comments about Lenny Henry were absolutely disgusting and I do think it\u8217\'20\'19s for Nigel Farage to make absolutely clear that that isn\u8217\'20\'19t Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s official view, but also to explain why so many people with those kinds of views seem to be attracted to becoming candidates for Ukip.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Asked whether the tweet was racist, he said: \u8216\'20\'18I think it is, and that\u8217\'20\'19s why I would like to hear a very clear denunciation of that from Nigel Farage. I think it is totally unacceptable and [Lenny Henry] is as British as you or I are.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 He added: \u8216\'20\'18I think there\u8217\'20\'19s a broader risk for Ukip here, because they position themselves as a patriotic party, they plaster the Union Jack all over their leaflets, but actually I think there is something very un-British about this kind of language, very unpleasant.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18We are not a divisive country, we want to be a country where we avoid that kind of rhetoric, and I think that\u8217\'20\'19s where there are some real dangers for Ukip.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron made his \u8216\'20\'18closet racist\u8217\'20\'19 comments in 2006 \u8211\'20\'13 but since then the Conservatives have been wary of making personal attacks on the Eurosceptic party.\par \par \uc2 Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s deputy chairman, former Tory MP Neil Hamilton, said Mr Henwood\u8217\'20\'19s comments were being investigated by the party.\par \par \uc2 He claimed that \u8216\'20\'18every party\u8217\'20\'19 had \u8216\'20\'18unknown\u8217\'20\'19 activists who \u8216\'20\'18may have said something unpleasant on social media\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hamilton told the BBC that the party was attracting \u8216\'20\'18decent\u8217\'20\'19 former supporters of the BNP who feel \u8216\'20\'18swamped\u8217\'20\'19 by \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 'SEND LENNY HENRY TO BLACK COUNTRY' FURORE\par \par \uc2 By RYAN KISIEL\par \par \uc2 Would-be Ukip councillor\u160\'00\'A0 William Henwood said Lenny Henry should emigrate to a \u8216\'20\'18black country\u8217\'20\'19 after the\u160\'00\'A0 comedian said there should be more ethnic minorities in\u160\'00\'A0 creative industries.\par \par \uc2 Defending his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  remark, the Ukip candidate later told the BBC: \u8216\'20\'18I think if black people come to this country and don\u8217\'20\'19t like mixing with white people why are they here?\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18If he (Henry) wants a lot of blacks around go and live in a black country.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 In previous tweets Mr Henwood, 66, has compared Islam to the Nazi Third Reich.

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Britons should celebrate the fact that their country is a \u8220\'20\'1Cmulti-cultural nation\u8221\'20\'1D, senior Conservatives have said.\par \par \uc2 Britons should celebrate the fact that their country is a \u8220\'20\'1Cmulti-cultural nation\u8221\'20\'1D, senior Conservatives have said.\par \par \uc2 The comments have emerged after new research said that the Tories had to do more to attract black and ethnic minority voters if they wanted to win next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election.\par \par \uc2 The description multi-cultural is often used by rightwing critics to criticise community groups who do not mix with their neighbours.\par \par \uc2 However, Michael Gove, the Education secretary and a Tory moderniser, issued the call for the Conservatives to reclaim the term at the Asian Business Awards dinner earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 He told the 500-strong black tie dinner at a hotel in central London earlier this month that Britain was a \u8220\'20\'1Cstronger country\u8221\'20\'1D because of its history of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe answer to our problems is not to denigrate success but to celebrate it; the answer to our problems is not to chip away at wealth creators with new taxes and new burdens, but to do everything possible to liberate them to create more jobs and opportunities for all.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAnd the answer to how we make our country strong in the future is that we welcome talent from whenever it comes and we celebrate the fact that we are stronger together as a United Kingdom, as a multi-cultural nation than we could ever be if we looked back to the past.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The comments from Mr Gove, who is close to Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , were backed by other senior Tories.\par \par \uc2 Alok Sharma\uc2  MP, the Conservatives\u8217\'20\'19 vice chairman for black and minority ethnic issues told The Daily Telegraph that people would regard to Mr Gove\u8217\'20\'19s remarks \u8220\'20\'1Cpositively\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8220\'20\'1CBritain is a multi-cultural nation and many will regard Michael Gove\u8217\'20\'19s comments positively.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe vast majority of people from ethnic minorities regard a multi-cultural nation as one in which communities are integrated into the mainstream of British society and adhere to British values, whilst being able to respect their own cultural heritage.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://polldaddy.com/poll/8003524/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Is multi-culturalism a force for good in modern day Britain?}}}\par \par \uc2 Research from Demos last week suggested that number of middle\u8211\'20\'13class ethnic minority voters could help tip the election in favour of \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The report by Trevor Phillips, a former head of the equalities watchdog, and Richard Webber, a university professor of geography, concluded that \u8220\'20\'1Cupwardly mobile\u8221\'20\'1D ethnic minority voters were more likely to turn Conservative.\par \par \uc2 The study said that Labour risked losing some of its traditional support from black and Asian voters as many move to the suburbs.\par \par \uc2 It suggested that second or third generation \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  could lose their "reflex" support for Labour, and those moving to traditionally white middle\u8211\'20\'13class areas would be less likely to vote Labour.\par \par \uc2 David Green, from the right of centre thinktank Civitas, said Mr Gove had confused "multi-ethnicity" with "multi-culturalism".\par \par \uc2 He said: "Michael Gove has confused a multi-cultural society with a multi-ethnic society. We have become a multi-ethnic society, but we beensuccessful because our dominant culture of freedom and democracy allows space for different lifestyles.\par \par \uc2 "The vital point is that alternative lifestyles must be compatible with a free, democratic and tolerant society.\par \par \uc2 "Multiculturalism is the name for the condition in which antagonistic cultures co-exist in the same country.\par \par \uc2 "Mr Gove should have known from his experience of dealing with alleged sectarianism in Birmingham\u8217\'20\'19s schools that not all cultures are compatible with a free society.\par \par \uc2 "Muslims who are opposed to extreme interpretations of Islam will not thank him for confusing the issue.\par \par \uc2 "There is good diversity and bad diversity, as the people of Ukraine can testify. Sectarianism is diversity that threatens freedom, democracy and toleration."\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140428ea4s005pl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Middle class Labour has permanently lost support to Ukip, claims Lord Glasman\par \par \uc2 Labour\u8217\'20\'19s working class support has \u8220\'20\'1Cdied\u8221\'20\'1D as the party becomes \u8220\'20\'1Cvery middle class\u8221\'20\'1D, an advisor to Ed Miliband has said.\par \par \uc2 Lord Glasman, the policy guru ennobled by Mr Miliband, said Labour voters who defected to Ukip may never return because the party is failing to address concerns on welfare and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He told The Times: "That is the dilemma at the heart of the party's strategy \u8212\'20\'14 is it possible to address these economic, political and cultural concerns when the party is becoming, in many ways, very middle class? What I mean by that is liberal and progressive in its sensibility.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 "Ed [Miliband] is trying to address it. This is a long-term trend since 2001, in terms of the working-class vote just declining quite dramatically. The Labour middle-class vote held up [in 2010]. It was the working-class vote that died.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThese are often people who are earning, who have jobs, but they don't see Labour as representing their interests."\par \par \uc2 Many working class communities have a feeling of \u8220\'20\'1Cdispossession and abandonment\u8221\'20\'1D, the peer said.\par \par \uc2 "There was possibly an assumption at first that [the rise of Ukip] would just work against the Tories," he said. "But there is a view that says that after the European and local elections are over, there could be a swing back to the Conservatives of Ukip voters. But will there be necessarily a swing back to Labour from the Ukip voters?"\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, yesterday said Ukip is attracting racist candidates who make \u8220\'20\'1Cdisgusting\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1Cun-British\u8221\'20\'1D comments.\par \par \uc2 The Health Secretary, said Ukip leader Nigel Farage had to denounce one of his candidates who suggested that Lenny Henry, the comedian, should emigrate to a \u8220\'20\'1Cblack country\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The gaffe was the latest embarrassment for Ukip, which last week was forced to suspend the \u8220\'20\'1Cposter boy\u8221\'20\'1D of its European party election broadcast after it was revealed he had posted a series of racist comments on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 However, weekend polls suggest the rows have failed to dent Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s popularity among voters, with polls giving Ukip a lead over Labour for the first time.\par \par \uc2 The survey by YouGov for The Sunday Times gave 31 per cent of the vote in next month\u8217\'20\'19s poll, ahead of Labour (28 per cent), the Conservatives (19 per cent) and the Liberal Democrats (9 per cent).\par \par \uc2 Mr Hunt said: \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s for Nigel Farage to make clear that isn\u8217\'20\'19t Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s official view, but also to explain why so many people with those kinds of views seem to be attracted to becoming candidates for Ukip. I think it is racist.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think it is totally unacceptable, he is as British as you and I are. There is a broader risk for Ukip here. They position themselves as a patriotic party, they plaster the Union Jacks all over their leaflets but actually there\u8217\'20\'19s something very un-British about this kind of language, very unpleasant. We are not a divisive country, there are some real dangers for Ukip.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140428ea4s001gv\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 Boris lashes out at PM for 'not doing anything' about flood of EU \uc2 immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By EMILY ASHTON, Whitehall Correspondent   \par \uc2 610 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2014\par 21:06\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd.

After four million \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  in the Labour years, the public has had more than enough."\par \par \uc2 Tory MP Mark Pritchard tweeted: "Ukip attracting support on EU migration/\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  issues more than issue of leaving the EU. Free movement of peoples needs a look."\par \par \uc2 Home Secretary Theresa May has previously suggested a cap on the number of EU migrants coming to Britain.\par \par \uc2 But this was branded \u8220\'20\'1Cillegal and undeliverable" by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.\par \par \uc2 We revealed in a landmark poll last year that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is seen as the crucial issue when it comes to renegotiating our powers.\par \par \uc2 Some 42 per cent of Brits believed slamming the door on EU migrants was of \u8220\'20\'1Cutmost importance".\par \par \uc2 Another 20 per cent said it should be a \u8220\'20\'1Cmajor aim".\par \par \uc2 Ten per cent more agreed we should renegotiate to limit numbers.

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Boris Johnson has made a veiled attack on \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's plan to cut net migration to the "tens of thousands", claiming voters were the victims of a "continual deceit" that politicians can control \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  while Britain remains a member of the EU.\par \par \uc2 The London mayor's comments will heighten speculation that he is building a platform for a future Tory leadership bid and preparing for a return to national politics at the 2015 election.\par \par \uc2 By combining an attack on the EU with a promise to control European migration, Mr Johnson's position may appeal to Tory supporters who are deserting to the UK Independence party, which hopes to win next month's European elections.\par \par \uc2 Referring to public anger over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , he said: "It's not so much the numbers or the impact - though they are angry about that - it's about the continual deceit that we can solve this problem whilst remaining members of the EU with free movement."\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  stood at the last election promising to cut net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to the "tens of thousands" but that target now looks certain to be missed because of a surge of arrivals from other European countries.\par \par \uc2 Mr Johnson told Total Politics magazine that he would have longer transition periods for migrants from new EU member states, sharing Mr Cameron's plan to extend the current seven-year work exemption when new countries join the EU.\par \par \uc2 But he also said there should be a "much more serious points system" to make sure people who come to Britain have work and can show they are contributing to society: such a move would almost certainly be contrary to EU law.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron expects Mr Johnson to stand for parliament at the 2015 election and has said he would welcome the prospect of having one of the party's biggest hitters campaigning alongside him.\par \par \uc2 The mayor says he has not made up his mind, but his return to Westminster would be seen by Tory MPs as the mayor preparing to stand for the Tory leadership if Mr Cameron steps down, possibly after a defeat in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Many Tory MPs believe Mr Cameron's apparent enthusiasm for Mr Johnson's return is largely an attempt to appear relaxed at the idea of the mayor sitting on the green benches again.\par \par \uc2 However, Mr Cameron says he wants to serve a full second term as prime minister and believes Mr Johnson could play a key role in a Tory government; some have argued the mayor could take on a role promoting infrastructure projects.\par \par \uc2 Such a scenario would mean that Mr Johnson would return as an MP at the same time as continuing to serve out his term as London mayor until 2016, although Mr Cameron would not put him into the cabinet until after he left City Hall.\par \par \uc2 "My job is to help the Tory cause in any way that I can, by running London to the best of my ability," Mr Johnson said. "I've got more than two years to go. Big mandate - a lot to fulfil."\par \par \uc2 Mr Johnson adds that the women in his office like the idea - sometimes rumoured - that he might fight the Richmond Park seat of the handsome millionaire Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, in a job swap that might see Mr Goldsmith contest the mayoralty in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140428ea4s004s9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 European election candidate was quoting an anti-Islamic passage from Winston Churchill book when he was arrested\par \par \uc2 A candidate in the European elections has been arrested after making a speech quoting from a book by Winston Churchill about Islam.\par \par \uc2 Paul Weston, chairman of the far right Liberty GB party, was making the speech on the steps of Winchester Guildhall, Hampshire, on Saturday, when a member of the public complained to police and he was arrested.\par \par \uc2 He had been reading from Churchill's book The River War, written in 1899 while he was a British army officer in Sudan.\par \par \uc2 Mr Weston, who is standing as a candidate in the South East European elections on May 22, was detained after he failed to comply with a request by police to move on under the powers of a dispersal order made against him and he was arrested on suspicion of religious/racial harassment.\par \par \uc2 A former UKIP candidate, who fell out with the party over what he described as its failure to address issues around Islam in Britain, went on to found the British Freedom Party.\par \par \uc2 The group formed an alliance with the far right English Defence League, but he quit the group last year launching Liberty GB.\par \par \uc2 Mr Weston, who recently predicted a war in Britain within 20-years between the white working class and \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , is married to a Romanian migrant.\par \par \uc2 He claims to have worked as a deep sea diver, a pilot in Africa and a property developer in the Czech Republic.\par \par \uc2 A Hampshire police spokesman said: \u8220\'20\'1CA 50-year-old man from Dorset was arrested outside Winchester Guildhall at approximately 2.30pm on Saturday April 26 after he failed to comply with a section 27 dispersal order.\par \par \uc2 "The dispersal order was issued following complaints from members of the public about the man's behaviour.\par \par \uc2 "He was further arrested on suspicion of religious/racial harassment. He has been bailed pending further inquiries to report back to police on May 24."\par \par \uc2 A Liberty GB spokesman said: "Mr Weston was standing on the steps of Winchester Guildhall, addressing the passers-by in the street with a megaphone. He quoted an excerpt about Islam from the book The River War by Winston Churchill.\par \par \uc2 "Reportedly, a woman came out of the Guildhall and asked Mr Weston if he had the authorisation to make this speech. When he answered that he didn't, she told him 'It's disgusting!' and then called the police.\par \par \uc2 "Six or seven officers arrived. They talked with the people standing nearby, asking questions about what had happened. The police had a long discussion with Mr Weston, lasting about 40 minutes.\par \par \uc2 "At about 3pm he was arrested. They searched him, put him in a police van and took him away."\par \par \uc2 His arrest has led reignited the debate about freedom of speech, particularly given that Mr Weston was reading from a book by wartime Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.\par \par \uc2 But those in the Muslim community said the police were correct to act if Mr Weston\u8217\'20\'19s actions were deliberately intended to incite hatred.\par \par \uc2 Mohamed Shafiq, leader of the Ramadan Foundation, said: \u8220\'20\'1COf course there should be freedom of speech, but with freedom of speech comes responsibility. If someone was to deliver this message in the centre of Bradford for example where there is a large Muslim population then it could be seen as a deliberate act of incitement.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are banning extremists from the Muslim community, the likes of Anjem Choudary, so it is right that the policy is applied equally.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think such people are very unpleasant people who thrive on publicity and thrive on winding people up and deliberately trying to upset people.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWinston Churchill said and wrote many great things, as Muslims we do not agree with his description of Islam in this passage and obviously a member of the public who heard these comments was offended enough to contact the police and complain.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the \uc2 Muslim Council of Britain\uc2  said: \u8220\'20\'1CWe are sure that even Mr Churchill, if confronted with what he wrote as a young man would now blush at his own writings, just as he would when presented with his description of Gandhi as a 'half- naked fakir.'\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur faith has often been criticised and attacked, so we are used to it. The question is, will Mr Weston's action lead to a credible violent attack against Muslims in this country? We leave that for the courts to decide.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140428ea4s002jt\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 'We are not forced to sell sex, we want to' \u8211\'20\'13 hookers' fury after Soho brothel raids\b0\par\par\uc2 Jaymi McCann   \par \uc2 1,027 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2014\par 16:10\par \uc2 dailystar.co.uk\par \uc2 DAICO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 SEX is why people go to Soho \u8211\'20\'13 even if they don\u8217\'20\'19t know it.\par \par \uc2 The millions of revellers who descend on the central London area every year might think they are going for a cocktail but what really drives them to the UK\u8217\'20\'19s centre of sex is the sleaze, excitement and colour of the red light district.\par \par \uc2 Soho is the heart of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s sex industry with an abundance of shops, erotic bookstores and \u8211\'20\'13 of course \u8211\'20\'13 brothels.\par \par \uc2 But many of the flats where prostitutes work were shut down in recent raids, leaving many suggesting the area will become sanitised of all its character.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey want to gentrify the area. Sell it off to the highest bidder,\u8221\'20\'1D one sex worker told me.\par \par \uc2 The blonde, who would only give her name as Cassie, said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe authorities are treating us like second class citizens. We are not worth anything to them."\par \par \uc2 Raids by the Metropolitan Police were criticised for unfairly targeting those working in the area.\par \par \uc2 Cassie adds: \u8220\'20\'1CPolice said they were there to stop human trafficking and that some of us were being forced to work there but that isn\u8217\'20\'19t true.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t take the girls' word for it and paraded them in the street in their underwear \u8211\'20\'13 they wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t let them get dressed. How is that human?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe use maids to keep us safe. They screen clients and are there when things go wrong. They are not pimps."\par \par \uc2 Some 18 brothels were closed in the raids that were the result of more than a year of investigations.\par \par \uc2 Selling sex is not an offence but brothels can be shut down if police prove the girls are being controlled.\par \par \uc2 It was claimed the maids were evidence that workers were forced to do certain shifts or see a set number of clients \u8211\'20\'13 but the girls insist the system was only for safety.\par \par \uc2 Girls who were there on the night of the raids have since complained that they were forced to stand outside in their underwear, that journalists and photographers were called and that some officers threatened to tell their parents or children about their profession.\par \par \uc2 Some \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  workers were taken to a \u8220\'20\'1Csafe place\u8221\'20\'1D despite insisting that they were not being forced to work.\par \par \uc2 More than 40 people were charged with a variety of offences but no girls were found to have been trafficked.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe were not being coerced,\u8221\'20\'1D insists Cassie. \u8220\'20\'1CI had sex for money by choice. That is not illegal. There is CCTV in Soho. Now we are being forced to work in places that aren't as safe, where we are more likely to be attacked.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPolice should be protecting us, not prosecuting us. We need support but now we are afraid to go to the police when we really need to. How is that justice?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Locals have spoken in defence of the sex workers, agreeing that they are safer in Soho.\par \par \uc2 Reverend Simon Buckley, from nearby St Anne\u8217\'20\'19s Church, condemned the way the situation had been handled.\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8220\'20\'1CThere is in my mind a clear case that something has gone extremely wrong here.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe were given assurance that the girls would be treated with respect...The girls who continue to work in the unclosed flats say that they would not feel confident in turning to the police if they were a victim of crime.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 It has to be noted that police have received no formal complaints from sex workers affected in the raids and insist they are \u8220\'20\'1Ccommitted\u8221\'20\'1D to working with the local community to make Soho crime-free.\par \par \uc2 But Rev Buckley adds that many girls won\u8217\'20\'19t complain. They feel vulnerable and do not want to be identified.\par \par \uc2 Sex Worker of the Year 2013 Charlotte Rose believes brothels provide "safety in numbers" and that forcing prostitutes to work alone is not the way to go.\par \par \uc2 Charlotte, who makes \u163\'00\'A3160 an hour, is to feature in a Channel 4 documentary focussing on the problems prostitutes face that will air tonight.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe should have the same working rights as anyone else. The nature of our work doesn\u8217\'20\'19t change that,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is a safety in numbers. There are dangers involved but why can\u8217\'20\'19t we have someone in the house looking after people without it being a pimp?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat happened puts the girls at risk even more. The way the police treated them shows they aren\u8217\'20\'19t worth anything. And if the police can treat them like that then why can\u8217\'20\'19t a potential attacker?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Much of the area is owned by Soho Estates who are pushing for redevelopment.\par \par \uc2 The company is owned by Fawn James, the granddaughter of sex-icon Paul Raymond, owner and advocate of London\u8217\'20\'19s strip clubs.\par \par \uc2 Westminster Council\uc2  gave the green light to a controversial new design that will see Walker\u8217\'20\'19s Court \u8211\'20\'13 a street still used for sex work today \u8211\'20\'13 transformed into a haven of cafes, clothes shops and restaurants.\par \par \uc2 But Soho Estates have strongly denied that the change will dilute the area\u8217\'20\'19s colour.\par \par \uc2 Related articles Brazil prostitutes learn English ahead of 2014 World Cup Wild sex parties in Poole force some residents to flee their homes at the weekends\par \par \uc2 Managing director John James said: "We are not trying in any way to drive sex workers out of Soho. They are an essential part of what Soho is about.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COn occasions a small number of individual sex workers may have to move to make way for a new development but that is no different from what happens in any big city. Soho is still the sexy heart of London and as far as we're concerned long may that continue".\par \par \uc2 But Cassie isn\u8217\'20\'19t convinced.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey may say that they are looking out for us and Soho\u8217\'20\'19s best interests but they certainly haven\u8217\'20\'19t asked us what we think would work,\u8221\'20\'1D said Cassie.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI just hope no-one else is killed because they have been forced to work on the streets.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Love for Sale with Rupert Everett airs tonight at 10pm on Channel 4.\par \par \uc2 Document DAICO00020140428ea4s0025t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

Equally, we are not a nation of dedicated secularists. I think we're a lot less secular than the most optimistic members of \uc2 the British Humanist Association\uc2  would think."\par \par \uc2 Professor Jim Al-Khalili, president of the British Humanist Association, was one of more than 50 public figures who signed a letter to the Daily Telegraph criticising Cameron's comments about Britain being a Christian country. They said that, apart from in a "narrow constitutional sense", there was no evidence to justify labelling Britain as a Christian state and that to assert otherwise ran the risk of fostering "alienation and division".\par \par \uc2 In his interview, when pressed for a yes/no response to the question about whether Britain was a Christian country, Williams replied: "A Christian country as a nation of believers? No. A Christian country in the sense of still being very much saturated by this vision of the world and shaped by it? Yes."\par \par \uc2 He also said: "Given that we have a younger generation who know less about this legacy . . . there may be a further shrinkage of awareness and commitment."\par \par \uc2 But this could also lead to people discovering Christianity afresh, he said. "I see signs of that, talking to youngsters . . . in school visits. There is a curiosity about Christianity."\par \par \uc2 According an ICM poll for the Sunday Telegraph, 56% of people say Britain is a Christian country, compared with 30% who say it is a non-religious society. Some 14% of respondents told ICM that they saw themselves as practising Christian, 38% said they were non-practising Christian, 41% non-religious, and 5% members of another faith.\par \par \uc2 Lady Warsi, the Foreign Office minister and minister for faith, told the paper that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was making Britain more Christian because "some of the biggest church-goers are people whose heritage is in Africa and the Caribbean".\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Lord Williams says Britain is not a nation of believers, but equally it is not a country full of dedicated secularists\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140428ea4s0001e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Features Pages\par \b \uc2 G2: 'Our family was shattered': In 2006, a 12-year-old girl became front-page news - held up as the symbol of a catastrophic cultural clash between a white mother fighting for custody of a child abducted by a 'Muslim tyrant' of a father. As a new play charts the truth behind the headlines, Amelia Gentleman talks to Molly and her mother\b0\par\par\uc2 Amelia Gentleman   \par \uc2 2,467 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 This is the story of a painful divorce, one which may be dimly familiar, because for a few weeks in 2006 the unhappy twists of this family's breakdown were front-page news. For a while, Molly Campbell's endearing 12-year-old face regularly headed news bulletins, as details emerged of the Scottish schoolgirl's apparent abduction from her mother's home on a remote island in the Outer Hebrides and her removal to her father's house in Pakistan.\par \par \uc2 The headlines summarised the situation in a crude and oddly racist way. "Girl 'snatched' from school gates and taken to Pakistan for 'forced' marriage." "'Barbaric' practice among third-world \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 ." "Fears grow for 'kidnap bride'." "Mother of all battles. If it was a movie it would be a blockbuster."\par \par \uc2 What happened was much more complicated, and also, paradoxically, much simpler. At its core, this was just an unhappy saga of two parents fighting with all their might to keep custody of their youngest child.\par \par \uc2 Reflecting on her experiences for the first time since returning to Scotland, Molly, now 19, and living again with her mother, remembers the misery of that battle. "I think that no parent should put their child in a situation where they have to choose between the parents," she says.\par \par \uc2 "Never. The child suffers so badly," her mother, Louise Fairley, says, stroking her daughter's hand.\par \par \uc2 A new play, My Name Is . . ., reflects on how this domestic calamity was seized on and made to symbolise something bigger than a simple marital collapse, blown up by the media into a catastrophic clash of cultures. Sudha Bhuchar, the playwright and co-founder of the Tamasha theatre company, remembers feeling dismayed by the coverage as the drama unfolded.\par \par \uc2 "At the time, it was immediately assumed that the Muslim tyrant of a father, with this long beard, had kidnapped his daughter and taken her back to Pakistan, to marry her off. There was a racial element to it: she was a white girl - Molly Campbell; one of ours has been taken by one of them. Asian girls go missing all the time, but you never hear that - but because she was a white Scottish girl . . ." Bhuchar says.\par \par \uc2 The play touches on British attitudes to Islam. "We see communities reduced to these stereotypes and Photofits. I thought: here we go again; the west versus Islam. It gets pegged on to everything - particularly then, just after 7/7, Afghanistan, Iraq."\par \par \uc2 Molly and her mother are perplexed at the way their story was pumped up into a national crisis. Louise recoils from the idea that this was ever really the story of a clash of two cultures. "[The media] ran away with it. The children got separated and religion and culture were to blame . . . but, for me, it was a breakdown of our lives. Our whole family was shattered and the children paid the ultimate price for it. That was the sadness of it," she says.\par \par \uc2 There was no threat of an arranged marriage by her father, Molly says; he just wanted to reunite the children, and continue to bring them up in the country in which he felt most at home.\par \par \uc2 When we meet in Glasgow, she says it is only now that she feels she is beginning to think independently. She is concentrating on "getting to know who I am, being me - not being told what to do, where to go, how to do things. This is my story, my life . . . It's about time I got control of it."\par \par \uc2 Naturally, she is still scarred by the experience. She reveals a tattoo up her arm, inked only the day before, which says: "Live every moment, laugh every day, love beyond words."\par \par \uc2 "I wanted something that when I read it, it will inspire me to just be happy, live life, where you are, laughing, positive, because you never know what's going to happen to you," she says.\par \par \uc2 Parts of her time in Pakistan were happy, she says, but she has only begun to appreciate how much she had to adjust and change herself when she went from one home to the other. "It was a happy time; I was with my dad, I had all these animals - cats, two geese, 20 chickens, five parrots, four or five goats," she says. She particularly loved her goats. "I would shampoo them and condition them. My dad would say: 'You're wasting all my money, stop shampooing the bloody goats!'" She laughs at the memory.\par \par \uc2 "But it was a big culture shock: the heat; the lack of freedom. I would stay home, unless either my dad or my brother was with me. I was at home most of the time. I didn't think of it at the time, but looking back at it, there were a lot of things I had to sacrifice. The freedom, not being able to have my friends knock on the door, and then go out, go to the park, to the shops, to the town."\par \par \uc2 She missed her blue mountain bike, left behind in Scotland. "I always wished I had that bike, but then again, if I'd had the bike, I wouldn't have been able to go on it. It is not a good thing, a girl riding a bike." She also missed out on her teenage years. "I didn't have the chance to be rebellious." Most of all she missed her mum.\par \par \uc2 "The fact of being so far away from my mum . . . it took a toll on me. I spent lot of years, just talking to my mum on Skype, I just wanted to be close to her."\par \par \uc2 Bhuchar's play is built from transcripts of interviews she did with the three protagonists in 2008, travelling to Lahore to meet Molly and her father, Sajad Rana, and later flying in a tiny plane to the Isle of Lewis to meet Louise, still grieving for the loss of her daughter. It presents a heartbreaking account of relationship breakdown, but begins by telling the story of how well things began. Louise and her ex-husband were both invited to recount how they met in Glasgow as teenagers in the 80s, Louise on roller-skates, Sajad in his tracksuit, fresh from the gym, and how they fell in love.\par \par \uc2 They married in 1984. Louise converted to Islam and gave birth to four children, whom they brought up as Muslims. When, after 16 years, the marriage ended, Sajad decided to move to Pakistan.\par \par \uc2 For a couple of years, all four children lived with him in Lahore; Louise had had a breakdown around the time of the divorce, and did not feel up to fighting for custody. But the children felt the pull of both parents, and hopped between countries; they returned to live with their mother in Scotland for a while, before their father persuaded the elder children to return with him again to Pakistan. This time Louise fled with her youngest child, Molly, to Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis.\par \par \uc2 But Molly's siblings tracked her down and when her older sister Tahmina arrived unexpectedly at her school one day, asking whether she would like to come back to live with her father, she said yes.\par \par \uc2 "When I look back now, I had no idea what was going on. I had no idea about the complications. In my mind, I was living with my mum and then decided I'm just going to live with my dad for a bit. I was really dumb. When my dad and my sisters came, they were just familiar faces. I didn't know we were going to Pakistan, I thought we were coming to London and then coming back. I didn't want to go to Pakistan," Molly says. They left the island without saying goodbye to Louise and, shortly afterwards, they flew to Pakistan.\par \par \uc2 Louise called the police to say her daughter had been kidnapped. Louise's mother, Molly's grandmother, told journalists that there was a plot to get the 12-year-old married off as a child bride, triggering an explosion of outrage. Within days, Sajad had called a press conference in Lahore, where cameras filmed as Molly called her mum and told her that she hadn't been kidnapped, and that she was happy to live with her father, and that her name was Misbah.\par \par \uc2 Cheerful pictures of Misbah, smiling in her salwar kameez, a dupatta wrapped around her head, were syndicated globally. She was shown saying firmly: "I don't want to meet my mother, I don't want to see her. She made me do things which I didn't want to do. I have my rights about where I want to live and who I live with and I want to live in Pakistan with my family. My name is Misbah Rana. My mum changed it to Molly so my family couldn't find me. She was the one who abducted me. People say that I got abducted. If I had been abducted, I wouldn't be here right now."\par \par \uc2 Memories of that press conference remain painful, and Molly doesn't feel able to talk in detail about why, at the time, she appeared to turn her back on her mother.\par \par \uc2 "There was a sea of press, all these cameras, all these heads, all these cameras, going click, click, click, and all these flashes while I was talking. When they would ask me a question, I would look to my dad, because I wouldn't know what to say. It was a really hard time. I was just a little girl. As a child, you look up to your parents for answers. I would look up to my dad. I was just a little girl," she says. Misbah, she explains, was the name on her birth certificate, but Molly had always been her nickname. She had always been known by both names.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't want to hurt my dad. But I didn't want to hurt my mum either," she says. "Children change their minds so often. You take them to a toy shop and they choose a toy; then the next day they see another toy and they think: 'Oh no, I want that one, I don't like the other one any more.' When it's toys, it doesn't matter, but when it's your parents, and you love both of them with your heart . . ."\par \par \uc2 Bhuchar read a powerful piece in the Guardian about Molly by Cathy Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy in 2007, and was inspired to write a play about the saga. Both Sajad and Louise, who were by then ignoring all requests from journalists and television documentary makers, were interested in the idea of a play being made about their lives. "Louise said I urgently need this story to be told. I went through so much. I need people to know," Bhuchar says.\par \par \uc2 Sajad says in interviews with Bhuchar that he also wanted his real character to come through. He told her that he still thought of himself as "Sajad from Glasgow", but found himself demonised in the press. "Suddenly, I was this bearded Muslim, a jihadi fundamentalist."\par \par \uc2 Molly, who still acts as a loyal mediator between two parents, is pleased that the play weaves together three stories. "The main reason I'm happy about the play is that it shows all stories, from all sides," she says, and laughs at the idea that people are interested in what happened to her. "I didn't think it would happen. I don't think it's that much of an amazing story."\par \par \uc2 Louise won the legal battle in Pakistan for Molly, but was unable to persuade her ex-husband to return her. "It was so frustrating. It was a horrific situation. I fought and fought," she says. Meanwhile, Molly got on with life, went to school in Lahore and made new friends. Some of the girls at school were advised not to associate with her - because she was half-white, half-British, she says, but others were interested in her unusual background. Their parents would say: "She's British - bring her in, have a cup of tea, there's my son if you want to marry him."\par \par \uc2 School was difficult because, to begin with, her Urdu was not quite fluent; and classes were much stricter than she was used to.\par \par \uc2 "You have to sit on the floor. There's no playground. When it is breaktime, we just changed seating position and leaned back on the wall, and started talking. It felt a bit more closed than being here. It wasn't like a prison. It's just a very strict place."\par \par \uc2 Although she is in touch with her dad, to whom she remains very attached, she doesn't envisage returning to live in Pakistan. In the end, Louise met her ex-husband in Scotland three years ago and begged him to allow Molly to return. Molly lived briefly with her older sister, before going back to live with her mum permanently two years ago. It took her a while to build up the courage to ask Louise if she could return to her home, she says.\par \par \uc2 "I was too scared to ask Mama if I could move back with her, just in case she said no. I thought: 'I don't know if she will want to take me back because of what I did to her last time.'"\par \par \uc2 Molly still finds talking about this time of her life upsetting. Mother and daughter are very close, physically, and finish each other's sentences. When they want to have a private moment, they switch into Urdu. "I just want life to stay exactly how it is," Molly says. "I think that of my whole life, this is the most perfect time. I'm with my mum. That's meant a lot. I love it."\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 How the Times reported the story in August 2006; Molly, aged 12, in Pakistan with her father in September that year\par \par \uc2 Molly, now 19, with her mother Louise Fairley in Scotland\par \par \uc2 Molly in Pakistan: in 2007, with her father and a friend; in 2006 with her elder sister Tahmina; and crying outside court when told she must return to Scotland.

\par\par \b \uc2 Populism is a dangerous game for the political class\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janan Ganesh   \par \uc2 865 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2014\par 17:26\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

A spirit of anti-politics began permeating the country around the turn of the millennium when Tony Blair, the last politician the British allowed themselves to love, broke their hearts by turning out to be a prime minister and not a miracle worker. The disillusion intensified after the Iraq war, a work of naive over-ambition forever remembered as an act of heinous deceit. Then came the crash, the expenses scandal and much more \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  than voters were told to expect.\par \par \uc2 Cynicism verging on nihilism is the closest thing modern Britain has to a national ideology. It has become common sense to assume the worst of anyone in public authority. Nigel Farage, Ukip's leader, profits from this foul zeitgeist, not because he is a manipulative genius but because he is the nearest populist to hand. If it were not him, it would be some other jobbing demagogue with the dumb luck to be here now.\par \par \uc2 It is not obvious how to take him on. But it is increasingly obvious how not to. Hounded by the mood of anti-politics, Britain's political class has become self-loathing and scared of its own shadow. Mainstream politicians ape the language and manner of populists. They vie to disown a "metropolitan elite" that they themselves constitute. They hope that nodding along as voters express their scorn for them will somehow spare them from it.\par \par \uc2 Politicians used to wound each other with accusations of incompetence, immorality or intellectual wrongness - all slurs grounded in substance. Now they try to define each other as "out of touch". When \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , the Conservative prime minister, attacks Labour for indulging dependency culture or withholding a referendum on EU membership, he points to the party's estrangement from public opinion. When Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, attacks the Tories for overseeing a fall in living standards, his point is that millionaires cannot care about the plight of the ordinary.\par \par \uc2 The measure of a politician's worth is how much he is like "us" and not like "them". Mr Farage's real achievement is not electoral - his party has no MPs and runs no councils - but cultural. He has spooked the mainstream into emulating the values and priorities of its own tormentors.\par \par \uc2 As a ploy to neutralise Mr Farage, this self-abasement gets nowhere because it concedes his basic point - that Britain is run by a conspiracy of malign people - and radiates the most lethal weakness in politics: inauthenticity. Mr Cameron is the highest-born prime minister since Alec Douglas-Home half a century ago. Mr Miliband is a professor's son whose main detour from north London's cognoscenti was a year teaching at Harvard. They stand for major parties. When they or their similarly rarefied lieutenants play at being the man in the street, it looks craven and affected.\par \par \uc2 The political classes believe they are unpopular because of something they have done. Certainly, expense-fiddling compounded their scuzzy reputation. And their sheer narrowness is alienating, too. Parliament has become a job guarantee for apparatchiks and activists who relax by watching television dramas set in other political capitals. In Britain politics is not just showbiz for ugly people but for weirdly obsessive people too.\par \par \uc2 The rise of populism, however, is not primarily the fault of any person - even Mr Blair - or any event. It is powered by structural trends that have been in train for decades. Prime among these is the fragmentation of class loyalty, which has cut the vote share commanded by the two main parties from 97 per cent in the 1951 election to 65 per cent in 2010. More votes are up for grabs, giving rebel parties a look-in.\par \par \uc2 Another trend is economic. Wage stagnation and structural unemployment, themselves born of even deeper trends to do with global competition and automation, have cultivated a sizeable class of people who feel frozen out by mainstream politics and its economic orthodoxies. Ukip, which would have come to nought in the age of full employment, only needs to stand still to make gains among these voters.\par \par \uc2 Then there is Britain's ageing population. Ukip relies on older voters, of whom there are more and more. Against all these trends there is not much mainstream politicians can do. They are as unlucky to be around in this phase of history as Mr Farage is fortunate. He will prosper at next month's European elections but his test comes with the general election a year later, when voters will get serious.\par \par \uc2 And here is the rub. Instead of smearing themselves with tar and feathers, mainstream politicians should remind populists that they do the hard work of politics: representing constituents, reconciling competing claims and taking an interest in dry corners of legislation that affect people's lives. Most politics is necessary drudgery. Seen from this angle, the "elite" are the people who get their hands dirty. And populists who damn the whole spectacle from cosy sidelines are the truly decadent ones.\par \par \uc2 janan.ganesh@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140428ea4s0035z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 'Only a joke': More fool the rise of TV celebs and their offensive 'jokes'\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ava Vidal   \par \uc2 927 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2014\par 16:19\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 A string of offensive jokes from celebrities including Jeremy Clarkson and Joan Collins have comedian Ava Vidal in a spin. What kind of society do we live in when racist epitaphs and distasteful jokes are easier to say than the word 'sorry'?\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://uk.tv.yahoo.com/top-gear-regrets-clarkson-remark-102726993.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Top Gear’s producer has once again expressed ‘regret’}}}\uc2  over one of its presenter Jeremy Clarkson\u8217\'20\'19s comments. He has had to express his regret so often that he may as well have an automated reply made up for whenever Clarkson offends yet another group of people.\par \par \uc2 Whether it's Indians, Mexicans, Asians, disfigured people, those with mental health issues or women, it seems that the only kind of equal opportunities that Clarkson knows about is equal opportunity offending. It seems that no one is safe from his archaic form of \u8216\'20\'18wit.\u8217\'20\'19 The trouble is, it will only happen again and the producer will pretend that he feels \u8216\'20\'18regret\u8217\'20\'19 once again.\par \par \uc2 When there are genuine feelings of regret then somebody is either fired or resigns before they can be fired. We have seen it time and time again. Frank Bough, Angus Deayton, Richard Keys, Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross have all had to redirect their careers after some unfortunate incidents. Most of them are still working (and in some cases they are doing much better) but for a moment a stand had to be made. The broadcasters had to show the public that they understood their outrage.\par \par \uc2 Most cases where there have been sackings or resignations took place before the digital age. Nowadays there is \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . Every television show has a \u8216\'20\'18hashtag\u8217\'20\'19 and researchers monitor them to see how much the show is being talked about. If a show gets either no reaction, or a very negative reaction on social media then you can be sure that it dies a quick death. The public have become the critics and journalists even quote tweets in newspapers articles about shows. Things have changed.\par \par \uc2 Programme makers need to have people talking about their shows so they invite people that they know will generate headlines irrespective of whether or not they are qualified to talk about the subject or not. This is why we are having \u8216\'20\'18debates\u8217\'20\'19 about serious, divisive subjects like benefits and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and people like {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.katiehopkins.co.uk/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Katie Hopkins}}}\uc2  are invited to sit centre stage.\par \par \uc2 These are important subjects that affect people\u8217\'20\'19s lives, that politicians spend ages crafting carefully worded statements about lest they should offend and effectively end their careers over. And television executives are treating them with all of the reverence that one would give to a pantomime performed by the local amateur dramatics society. Who can honestly hold their hands up and say that when thinking about these serious issues their first thought has been, \u8220\'20\'1CI wonder where Katie Hopkins stands on the issue?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Equally, on the other side of the Atlantic comedienne {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/joan-rivers-blasts-cleveland-house-horrors-vics-live-rent-free-decade-article-1.1766950"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Joan Rivers has caused controversy again}}}\uc2  . This time because of a joke that she made at the expense of the three women that were held captive by Ariel Castro saying that they had more space than she does in her daughter\u8217\'20\'19s guest room.\par \par \uc2 Even when the women were upset by the comments she still did not apologise choosing instead to add that she had \u8220\'20\'1Cno sympathy as they got to live rent free making them freeloaders.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 She forgot to add that these women were snatched off the street, their families were devastated and they were being repeatedly raped and beaten. 'Cause perhaps that would have spoilt the \u8216\'20\'18joke\u8217\'20\'19. Joan Rivers\u8217\'20\'19 defence was that it was only a joke and that is what comedians do. I have heard that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10679923/Racist-jokes-its-only-a-joke-how-far-is-too-far-in-comedy.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 defence many times before as an excuse for trotting out lazy, disablist, racist tropes}}}\uc2  and it is simply not good enough.\par \par \uc2 Maybe Ms Rivers has never heard the comedy rule that comedy + time = humour. And these women are just not ready to laugh yet. And perhaps they never will be. What kind of society do we live in when racist epitaphs and distasteful jokes are easier to say than the word 'sorry'?\par \par \uc2 While these television producers are rubbing their hands in glee that their shows are being spoken about and generating headlines, perhaps these stars need to remember the hard lesson learned by Jade Goody. She was trotted out in front of cameras, the template for the stars of the series The Only Way Is Essex where the middle classes would mock her accent and laugh as she celebrated and showcased her lack of education. And then it all went wrong.\par \par \uc2 She was on Celebrity Big Brother and she made a racist comment to Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty and then she was shunned by those that had used her to gain ratings. The magazines and newspapers stopped calling and the money stopped rolling in. She was not taken back into the public\u8217\'20\'19s hearts until they found out about her tragic illness that caused her untimely death.\par \par \uc2 So the Clarksons, Rivers and Hopkins of this world had better start to become their own moral compass. Because it seems as though the producers of their shows have no intention of doing it. I know first hand what it is like to have an audience with you as you are pushing the envelope and how quickly they switch when they decide you have crossed the line. And if and when the proverbial hits the fan, there will be no one to cushion the fall.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140428ea4s003h1\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Joe Riley: Onward militant atheists, marching as to bore\b0\par\par\uc2 By Joe Riley   \par \uc2 563 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2014\par 12:49\par \uc2 liverpoolecho.co.uk\par \uc2 LIVEONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Trinity Mirror   \par \par \uc2 "We are still living in some kind of Christian country, albeit surrounded by millions of non-believers"\par \par \uc2 Last year I attended the \u160\'00\'A0funeral of a long-standing colleague and friend, at which another retired colleague, a once professed atheist, \u160\'00\'A0sitting next to me, sang mightily through every verse of ther hymn, For All the Saints.\par \par \uc2 Last week, however, it was his turn to join the choir eternal.\par \par \uc2 Had he experienced a late conversion? Definitely not, said his widow, despite the local vicar giving a eulogy.\par \par \uc2 What further proof is needed, that, as Superspoon Cameron insists, we are still living in some kind of Christian country, albeit surrounded by millions of non-believers.\par \par \uc2 Even former home secretary Jack Straw, himself a Jew, \u160\'00\'A0has told British Muslims that they must accept that Britain is built on Christian values.\par \par \uc2 That's certainly true historically and socially.\par \par \uc2 Folk may be forsaking congregations in droves, except at cathedrals, where most go for the music, not the prayers or preaching.\par \par \uc2 But what trendy so-called intellectual atheists, of the type who wrote in protest at David Cameron's comments, too readily forget to consider is the purpose, rather than the facts of life.\par \par \uc2 Their existence is all statistics and no spirituality. Anything they can't experience or see is false until proven (so much for x-rays, electricity etc).\par \par \uc2 The church, as an institution, is faltering: abusing priests, dodgy financiers and gay marriage have all conspired to make religion less public.\par \par \uc2 But most people still believe in \u8220\'20\'1Csomething.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Liverpool's new Roman Catholic archbishop is installed on Thursday.

The light we are seeing is from the reign of Henry V111.\par \par \uc2 Trouble is, given that lots of the Bible events are clearly extra-terrestrial, we have problems even with scientific concepts.\par \par \uc2 We assume water is necessary for life. We cannot yet master time travel. But we have, metaphorically, \u160\'00\'A0already stuck our heads between our legs and collectively \u160\'00\'A0whistled up our Barcelonas.\par \par \uc2 As if it isn't preposterous enough that the government is grabbing green belt for homes, not least to accommodate an out of control \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , communities secretary Eric-in-a-Pickles is \u160\'00\'A0now selling off allotments, despite a massive shortage.\par \par \uc2 And when the answer for compensation does lie in the soil, it is often of inferior quality.\par \par \uc2 Allotments, like gardens, are in the British blood. Part of the inherent desire for self-sufficiency.\par \par \uc2 Pickles needs to redevelop all existing brownfield sites before making compost of government promises to protect plots.\par \par \uc2 Royal Mail\uc2  operations director Geoff Brandon has used his workers to deliver propaganda junk mail claiming its service to be far superior to that of rivals \uc2 TNT Post\uc2 , who presently only operate in London, Manchester and Liverpool, but hope to cover 40% of British homes and businesses by 2017.\par \par \uc2 He'll be delighted at reports of TNT's late deliveries and alleged dumping of mail.\par \par \uc2 TNT has blamed \u8220\'20\'1Chuman nature\u8221\'20\'1D for the lapses.\par \par \uc2 How about poor management?\par \par \uc2 Document LIVEONL020140428ea4s0015p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

But Ed Miliband doesn't know which side he is on\b0\par\par\uc2 By Dan Hodges   \par \uc2 1,051 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2014\par 14:29\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s guru is back. In {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4074563.ece"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 an interview with the Times ()}}}\uc2 , Maurice Glasman has popped up to warn his political padawan he\u8217\'20\'19s flirting with electoral disaster by being too \u8220\'20\'1Cmiddle-class\u8221\'20\'1D. Labour is losing voters hand over fist to Ukip in its \u8220\'20\'1Cheartlands\u8221\'20\'1D, he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThat is the dilemma at the heart of the party\u8217\'20\'19s strategy \u8212\'20\'14 is it possible to address these economic, political and cultural concerns when the party is becoming, in many ways, very middle-class? What I mean by that is liberal and progressive in its sensibility.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Warning Ed Miliband he is in danger of becoming excessively middle-class is a bit like warning the Pope he\u8217\'20\'19s in danger of becoming too associated with Catholicism. When I finally get round to establishing my Occupy the Middle Class movement, Ed is going to be our honorary life president. Whether he likes it or not.\par \par \uc2 But Glasman\u8217\'20\'19s latest intervention is still an illuminating one. First, it represents the latest incarnation of the Labour Party\u8217\'20\'19s favorite new pastime, \u8220\'20\'1CDefining the Defeat\u8221\'20\'1D. Most senior Labour supporters recognise the game is almost up. They can read the polls, and the economic indicators, and Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s personal approval ratings. And they know what they foreshadow.\par \par \uc2 So the various Labour factions are starting to put down markers. They are attempting to ensure that when Labour loses in 2015 it will have lost because their personal strategy wasn\u8217\'20\'19t followed. Which is why last month we had the think tanks warning that Miliband wasn\u8217\'20\'19t being radical enough. That was immediately followed by Len McCluksey warning he wasn\u8217\'20\'19t being Left-wing enough. This morning Jessica Asato, Labour\u8217\'20\'19s candidate in Norwich North \u8211\'20\'13 and something of a New Labour poster girl \u8211\'20\'13 has warned Labour \u8220\'20\'1Chas still got a lot of convincing to do\u8221\'20\'1D on the economy, and more generally needs to \u8220\'20\'1Clift the conversation into a serious offer for the future\u8221\'20\'1D. Norwich North is significant because it represents the seat Labour needs to win to secure an overall majority.\par \par \uc2 What\u8217\'20\'19s also interesting is the tone of Glasman\u8217\'20\'19s comments on Labour\u8217\'20\'19s middle-class dilemma. \u8220\'20\'1CEd [Miliband] is trying to address it,\u8221\'20\'1D he claims. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a long-term trend since 2001, in terms of the working-class vote just declining quite dramatically. The Labour middle-class vote held up [in 2010]. It was the working-class vote that died. These are often people who are earning, who have jobs, but they don\u8217\'20\'19t see Labour as representing their interests."\par \par \uc2 Polling day is now just over a year away. And yet within Labour\u8217\'20\'19s ranks the debate about strategy is being conducted in essentially the same way it was in the weeks immediately following Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s election in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Should Labour reach out to the middle classes? Should they appeal to their lost blue-collar base? Should they be pitching to disillusioned Lib Dems? Should they be attempting to ward off a rampant Ukip? Should they be pitching to potential Tory switchers?\par \par \uc2 These questions needed to be put to rest 18 months ago. Labour\u8217\'20\'19s strategy should now be locked; the debate centered on the most effective way to implement it.\par \par \uc2 But it isn\u8217\'20\'19t. As the polls narrow, and the recovery becomes embedded, Labour is becoming sucked into a conversation with itself about what conversation it should be having with the British people. Contrast that with the Conservatives, who have been doggedly setting out their \u8220\'20\'1Cthings are slowly getting better. Don\u8217\'20\'19t let Labour ruin it\u8221\'20\'1D mantra for the best part of two years now.\par \par \uc2 Then there is the substance of Glasman\u8217\'20\'19s comments. And of course, he\u8217\'20\'19s right. For all the talk of consigning Blairism to the dustbin of history, Labour is a more middle-class party now that it\u8217\'20\'19s ever been. Partly this is a natural extension of the persona of its leader, partly it\u8217\'20\'19s the hangover from Blair\u8217\'20\'19s modernisation project, and partly it\u8217\'20\'19s because Labour has been embracing the Lib Dem refugees that have swelled its ranks in the wake of Nick Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s great betrayal.\par \par \uc2 The problem this presents is that Labour has reacted to the realisation it\u8217\'20\'19s insufferably middle-class in the way the middle classes always react to the realisation they\u8217\'20\'19re middle-class. It\u8217\'20\'19s run around pretending to be working-class.\par \par \uc2 Pretending is the operative word, here. The Labour Party basically consists of two kinds of people. Those elements of the Labour Right who adopted the view \u8220\'20\'1CLabour\u8217\'20\'19s base will take care of itself\u8221\'20\'1D, and then set about tailoring a political message that would resonate with a mythical place called \u8220\'20\'1Cmiddle England\u8221\'20\'1D. And those elements of the centre-Left who would theoretically like to engage with the working-class, but are too terrified of the impact that engagement would have on their own liberal sensitivities.\par \par \uc2 Under Ed Miliband the latter group are in the ascendency. Which is why Labour talks a good game about representing \u8220\'20\'1Cthe workers\u8221\'20\'1D, but then comes out with a policy agenda in areas such as \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , welfare reform and law and order that is unrecognisable to most working-class voters. Essentially, Labour has declared a class war without making up its mind which side of the war it wants to be on.\par \par \uc2 Maurice Glasman, to his credit, recognises this, hence his efforts to get Miliband to sign up to his working-class \u8220\'20\'1CBlue Labour\u8221\'20\'1D agenda. Unfortunately, those efforts have failed. Partly because of the naivety with which Glasman himself initially pursued them. And partly because the adoption of that agenda would have entailed a shift to the Right politically unpalatable to a party still coming to terms with Tony Blair\u8217\'20\'19s own great betrayal.\par \par \uc2 So Labour will run in 2015 as a middle-class party pretending to be a working-class party by trying to win over working-class voters with middle-class policies. And it will lose in Norwich North, as it will just about everywhere else.\par \par \uc2 At which point the markers placed down over the past few months will be picked up and pocketed. And the debate will begin all over again. And again. And again.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140428ea4s002ut\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Party now too middle class, says Miliband guru Alienated voters quit Labour for Ukip\par \par \uc2 Labour voters are defecting to Ukip because the party has become too "middle class", a leading ally of Ed Miliband has warned.\par \par \uc2 Lord Glasman, a policy guru who was ennobled by Mr Miliband, said that the rise of Ukip would hit Labour "in the heartlands". He urged the party to adopt a series of measures to win back working-class support.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with The Times, he said that Labour needed to address concerns about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and welfare to stop voters from abandoning the party permanently. "That is the dilemma at the heart of the party's strategy \u8212\'20\'14 is it possible to address these economic, political and cultural concerns when the party is becoming, in many ways, very middle class? What I mean by that is liberal and progressive in its sensibility," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Ed [Miliband] is trying to address it. This is a long-term trend since 2001, in terms of the working-class vote just declining quite dramatically. The Labour middle-class vote held up [in 2010]. It was the working-class vote that died.\par \par \uc2 These are often people who are earning, who have jobs, but they don't see Labour as representing their interests."\par \par \uc2 Lord Glasman made his intervention as Ukip surged into first place in polls before European elections next month. Nigel Farage's party is at 31 per cent for the vote, according to YouGov. The poll put Ukip three points clear of Labour and 12 points ahead of the Tories.\par \par \uc2 The Labour peer is the second prominent figure in a few days to warn of the threat from Ukip. Jon Cruddas, the Labour MP overseeing the party's policy review, warned last week that Ukip had "the potential to be a significant threat to the Labour party". Ukip was accused yesterday by a Tory cabinet minister of attracting racists. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, made the remark as he denounced "disgusting" comments by a Ukip candidate about the comedian Lenny Henry. William Henwood, a candidate in Enfield, north London, said that Mr Henry should emigrate to a "black country".\par \par \uc2 Echoing \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's infamous remarks in 2006 that Ukip was made up of "fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists", Mr Hunt said that Mr Farage should explain why his party was drawing racist candidates.\par \par \uc2 The case comes days after Ukip suspended Andre Lampitt, who featured in its election broadcast, after discovering he had tweeted that Islam is "evil" and Mr Miliband is not British. "I do think Continued on page 4, col 3 Continued from page 1 those comments about Lenny Henry were absolutely disgusting and I do think it's for Nigel Farage to make absolutely clear that it's not Ukip's official view, but also to explain why so many people with those kinds of view seem to be attracted to becoming candidates for Ukip," Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 5 Live.\par \par \uc2 "[Ukip] position themselves as a patriotic party. They plaster the Union Jack all over their leaflets, but actually I think there is something very un-British about this kind of language."\par \par \uc2 Neil Hamilton, Ukip's deputy chairman and a former Tory MP, said that the comments would be investigated. He added, however: "This is a council candidate of whom you would have never have heard but for all the social media archaeologists that are employed by Labour, the Liberal party and the Tories to try and track down any unknown Ukip member or activist who may have said something unpleasant on social media."\par \par \uc2 Nick Griffin, the BNP leader, defended the Ukip councillor's comments.\par \par \uc2 He told the BBC that the "real racism" was the "bullying by the BBC and by the political elite of ordinary British people, of various parties, who stand up and say what most ordinary people think".\par \par \uc2 Lord Glasman's warning will concern many Labour members. He said that there was a feeling of "dispossession and abandonment" among workingclass communities.\par \par \uc2 "There was possibly an assumption at first that [the rise of Ukip] would just work against the Tories," he said. "But there is a view that says that after the European and local elections are over, there could be a swing back to the Conservatives of Ukip voters. But will there be necessarily a swing back to Labour from the Ukip voters?"

"The Jungle", a lawless tented camp of hundreds of migrants, was destroyed by French authorities in 2009.\par \par \uc2 With no French police in sight, Sun snapper Brad Wakefield captured the dramatic images of the stowaway in his death-trap hideaway. The man's terrified grimace is a damning testament to Europe's current failing \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy, where a man fleeing a wartorn land is prepared to risk death passing from Earth's fifth-richest nation, France, to the sixth - Britain.\par \par \uc2 At a squalid migrant tent city close to the carriageway, Iranian Esmail Seyedi \u8212\'20\'14 pictured above with Sun man Oliver \u8212\'20\'14 explained occupants' desperation to make the journey.\par \par \uc2 Esmail, 25, says he has twice entered the UK illegally in the back of lorries \u8212\'20\'14 and been deported each time. Now he is among more than 600 migrants in Calais from war-ravaged nations like Syria, Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia trying to get in.\par \par \uc2 He said: "There are jobs in the UK and there is humanity.\par \par \uc2 "In France there is nothing for us. We want to work, not claim benefits. We want to fit in with your way of life. People here will try jumping on lorries every day until we reach Britain."\par \par \uc2 Esmail's shanty town of 135 tents is a reminder of the Red Cross camp at nearby Sangatte where up to 2,000 \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  once gathered. That was shut in 2002 after Britain accepted hundreds of migrants in a deal with the French government.\par \par \uc2 The number of asylum seekers living in Calais fell to just 100 by 2012. But numbers are said to have risen six-fold recently \u8212\'20\'14 and French charities say they are struggling to feed them all. Migrants huddle around camp fires at the rubbish-strewn main camp, on disused rail lines on the quayside. Hundreds of men share just three fetid toilets.\par \par \uc2 Occupants while away the hours between dashes for lorries with games of cricket, using discarded pieces of wood as bats.\par \par \uc2 Strolling past the camp, daytripper Deanne Rose and her family were shocked at the sight. The office manager, of Cannock, Staffs, said: "You see it on TV but it's shocking in reality. It was intimidating to walk past, but also very sad. I don't like seeing people living like that."\par \par \uc2 And the 42-year-old mum of two said Britain might not be the promised land of the migrants' dreams.\par \par \uc2 "We've got our own problems with our own people going to food banks," she added.\par \par \uc2 While Calais is the bottleneck of British illegal \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , Italy has become the gateway for the hungry and desperate entering the EU.\par \par \uc2 So-called "boat people" are landing there at an even faster rate than during the 2011 Arab Spring turmoil, when 62,692 arrived in a year. More than 22,000 migrants have made it to Italy this year \u8212\'20\'14 about seven times as many as last year.\par \par \uc2 Some experts predict more than 100,000 arrivals this year. Many want to make Britain their home.\par \par \uc2 A couple of hours after the Afghan's escape attempt, mayhem on the N216 had started again. A group of some 28 migrants were seen weaving through the holiday traffic to reach the lorry tailback.\par \par \uc2 At least three bedraggled-looking men attempted to stow away inside what appeared to be stone-crushing machinery. This time cops \u8212\'20\'14 one armed with what looked like a rubber bullet gun \u8212\'20\'14 sped to the scene.\par \par \uc2 Yet we witnessed no arrests or checks on ID papers. The migrants were simply ordered off the truck and strolled away to try again later.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the police were keener on inspecting my journalist ID.\par \par \uc2 When I suggested they appeared overwhelmed by the hundreds of migrants there, one officer snapped: "It's a British problem."\par \par \uc2 Calais deputy mayor Philippe Mignonet believes between ten and 30 people make it across the border from the town each day.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The case for new high-speed rail links between London and the north is strong. The interests of a small number of voters and their MPs must not derail it\par \par \uc2 More than 30 Conservative MPs are expected to oppose the government today when the House of Commons votes on the second reading of a bill to authorise the HS2 high-speed railway line. Most of the rebels represent constituencies along the proposed route. They will break ranks because they fear their constituents' wrath in next year's election, and because they know it will not prompt a crisis for their party: with Labour's support, the ayes will almost certainly have it.\par \par \uc2 Even so, the rebels are wrong. They are putting narrow sectional interest above the national interest. They are prioritising fears about what might happen if the line is built over what we know will happen if it is not.\par \par \uc2 Infrastructure projects on this scale are expensive, disruptive and controversial, and take decades to complete. Their economic returns may have to be measured over yet more decades. They cannot necessarily be left to the private sector, but this does not mean they can be left on the drawing board. Modernising Britain's transport network for future generations is a central role of government \u8212\'20\'14 a role the rebels have chosen to forget. The number of passengers using the rail network has doubled in 20 years, to 1.5 billion. Combined passenger and freight use is expected to grow by another 30 per cent by 2024. Rail users are already enduring delays and overcrowding that few other advanced economies would tolerate. As \uc2 Sir David Higgins\uc2 , the chairman of HS2 Limited, has forcefully argued, these facts present Britain with a stark choice.\par \par \uc2 It is a choice between ever-increasing pressure on the existing rail network, relieved only by piecemeal modernisation bringing marginal improvements at great cost, and a massive increase in overall capacity such as that offered by HS2.\par \par \uc2 The project is currently budgeted at \u163\'00\'A350 billion.\par \par \uc2 Of that, an estimated \u163\'00\'A312 billion would go towards compensating those forced to move. The disruption to their lives is regrettable and their opposition to the line inevitable. The role of government in this case is to listen carefully and mitigate the damage to homes and the environment as far as possible, but above all it is to make the case and see it through.\par \par \uc2 So far Sir David is doing a better job of this than the coalition. His most recent published report recognised that a significant failing of HS2 planning so far was not excessive ambition, but a lack of it. He has unwisely called for the shelving of plans for a link between the HS2 line and the existing high-speed Channel Tunnel rail link, even though without it high-speed travellers from the north who are bound for Europe will have to slow to a crawl while changing trains in London. He has, however, proposed speeding up the construction of HS2's second phase, north of Birmingham, so that it reaches a new hub in Crewe by 2027. The previous target date was 2033, so far in the future that it risked leaving millions of potential beneficiaries unenthused.\par \par \uc2 Today's revolt is by MPs who don't want high speed at any speed. Cheryl Gillan, the former Tory Welsh Secretary, has said that rather than investing in new track and state-of-the-art trains, the government should focus on filling in potholes and giving passengers on-board wi-fi. She posits a false choice of stunning timidity. Of course Britain must fill its potholes. It must invest boldly, too.\par \par \uc2 New infrastructure is not desirable for its own sake. Spain's high-speed rail network, for instance, would never have passed a proper cost-benefit analysis. Britain in 2014 is different. Its economy is growing. The country is overcrowded and in danger of grinding to a halt.\par \par \uc2 Rebels attract headlines, whether they oppose new railway lines or EU membership or \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . This does not make them right.

All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 IF the polls showing Nigel Farage storming to victory in Europe are right, then we are all "fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists" now.\par \par \uc2 One in three voters is ready to back Ukip \u8212\'20\'14 and that figure could soar further in the run-up to local and EU elections on May 22.\par \par \uc2 Many more agree with Farage's outspoken views on mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and EU arrogance, even if they won't vote for him.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  regrets using such ripe terms to label Ukip voters \u8212\'20\'14 many of them ex-Tories \u8212\'20\'14 even though the evidence increasingly shows he was not far from the truth.\par \par \uc2 One racist Ukip candidate wants comedian Lenny Henry to go and live in "a black country" while another has branded Islam "organised crime under religious camouflage".\par \par \uc2 Nige himself is accused of using the N word, although he denies it.\par \par \uc2 Such outbursts might have torpedoed any other established party. Ukip seems to absorb them as valuable free publicity.\par \par \uc2 For the time being, voters no longer care what Ukip really represents, no matter how shady or objectionable.\par \par \uc2 They just relish this chance to give politicians a free kicking. Since discovering my MEP is a Lib Dem, I might do the same.\par \par \uc2 Ukip is now way ahead of the three major parties, with Tories trailing Labour in third place and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg gloriously at risk of losing all his 12 Euro MPs.\par \par \uc2 Cabinet minister Jeremy Hunt yesterday admitted voters are "angry".\par \par \uc2 "They are right to be angry because we have just had the worst recession since the War," he said.\par \par \uc2 Protest parties There is plenty of good news around on jobs and economic growth, but the PM would be wrong to assume this is enough to make the Kippers go away.\par \par \uc2 Many unhappy Tories will vote Ukip next month then return to the Tory fold for next year's General Election.\par \par \uc2 But many will never come back, or they will cease voting altogether. Maverick Farage has caught the public mood against endless Brussels bullying. Europe and the scandal of mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  are inextricably linked in the public mind.\par \par \uc2 His forthright speeches make the three major parties look deceitful and insincere \u8212\'20\'14 especially Labour, which slyly opened the floodgates to FOUR MILLION newcomers in a single decade.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the most astonishing poll finding is not Ukip racing ahead, but shameless Labour holding second place while refusing to give us a referendum.\par \par \uc2 Voters across Europe are increasingly resentful and turning to protest parties such as Ukip. One day, Red Ed will have to cave in.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  needs to demonstrate in deeds, not words, that he "gets it".\par \par \uc2 So far he has talked a lot about changing the way Britain does business with Brussels. But his enemies within the Tory party claim they have seen little evidence he is ready for a showdown.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's biggest problem is complacency," says a senior minister.\par \par \uc2 "He leaves issues to fester and then has to scramble to repair damage that should have been avoided."\par \par \uc2 The worry for Mr Cameron is that a humiliating defeat on May 22 could stir rebellion within his own party on May 23.\par \par \uc2 Rebel Tory MPs can't wait to march into Downing Street with a list of demands on tax, welfare reform and a shake-up on human rights.\par \par \uc2 One Cabinet minister believes the right policies could still win the Tories an outright majority in 2015.\par \par \uc2 "It is like 1992, when John Major was behind in the polls right up to election day," he said. "People pulled back from the brink, but it was a close-run thing."\par \par \uc2 Chancellor \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  will be pressed to deliver his promise on inheritance tax.\par \par \uc2 Migrants might be made to wait three years for welfare \u8212\'20\'14 especially housing benefit.\par \par \uc2 The most outspoken rebels are in a minority. But their views are shared by many of the bright new MPs elected in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron's task is to stop opportunists striking for reform while the issue is hot and persuading moderate Right-wingers to hold fire until he has won \u8212\'20\'14 or lost \u8212\'20\'14 in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140428ea4s00099\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

He wrote: 'Islam reminds me of the 3rd Reich. Strength through violence against the citizens.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Henry, 55, is the son of Jamaican \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and was born and raised in Dudley, West Midlands. He shot to fame as a comedian and has recently performed to great critical acclaim in Shakespeare.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month he said that he wanted the public to join his campaign to put more ethnic minorities on the screen. Ukip has already launched an investigation into another of its aspiring politicians after apparently homophobic and racist comments came to light.\par \par \uc2 On March 29, the day gay marriage was made legal in the UK, Robert Bilcliff, who is standing to be a councillor in Tamworth, Staffordshire, wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : 'Sad day for all us straight people.'\par \par \uc2 In a separate \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post in July 2012 he allegedly made a joke against Muslims.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140427ea4s0000k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

The party also appears to attract more than its fair share of candidates with eccentric and, in some cases, obnoxious views.\par \par \uc2 But when polls show Nigel Farage's supporters streaking ahead of Labour and the Conservatives, while trampling the Lib Dems into dust, isn't it time for the mainstream parties to wake up to what's happening in modern politics?\par \par \uc2 To date, their sole line of attack has been to \uc2 seek\uc2  out and heap abuse on mavericks in Ukip's ranks.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, this was the approach adopted yesterday by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, a normally mildly-spoken Cameron ally, who condemned the offensive views of a local council candidate as 'absolutely disgusting', 'divisive' and 'un-British'.\par \par \uc2 But if the idea is to tarnish Mr Farage's whole party with guilt by association, it clearly isn't working.\par \par \uc2 With 31 per cent now saying they'll vote Ukip in the euro-elections - against 28 per cent for Labour, 19 per cent for the Tories and 9 per cent for the Lib Dems - it seems that the more the party is insulted, the stronger its support grows.\par \par \uc2 Are Mr Hunt and Co trying to suggest that almost a third of the population are disgusting, divisive and un-British?\par \par \uc2 On the contrary, the overwhelming majority of Ukip supporters are decent people, heartily fed up with having their views ignored by the political class.\par \par \uc2 If they want to regain lost ground, the mainstream parties should try heeding voters' wishes on such issues as uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , human rights madness and the relentless surrender of our sovereignty to Brussels.\par \par \uc2 Abuse alone, however merited in individual cases, just sounds like panic.\par \par \uc2 Fifi strikes again\par \par \uc2 FOR the living, breathing embodiment of everything voters find distasteful about the political class, look no further than Westminster's Madame Fifi, Nick Clegg.\par \par \uc2 With a monstrous sense of entitlement, the Lib Dem leader says he will demand to stay in office as his price for supporting the next government in another hung parliament. Otherwise he will force a costly election replay.\par \par \uc2 As for whether he would prefer to bed down with Labour or the Tories, he appears not to care (though with a flirtatious hitch of his skirt, he describes Ed Miliband as 'a very civilised guy').\par \par \uc2 Indeed, all that seems to matter to Mr Clegg is that he should clock up ten years as Deputy Prime Minister, in what he arrogantly describes as the 'fascinating laboratory' of coalition politics.\par \par \uc2 Don't you have to pinch yourself to remember that here speaks a man whose party commands a paltry nine per cent support in the polls - only one point ahead of the cranky fringe Greens?\par \par \uc2 Since 2010, this country has had experience enough of the unprincipled Mr Clegg abusing his disproportionate say in government, whether by blocking reform of human rights law and constituency boundaries or imposing a chaotic free meals policy on primary schools.\par \par \uc2 To quote a former Tory aide, who had to deal with him: 'Nick Clegg is the worst kind of modern MP. He is self-obsessed, sanctimonious and so dishonest he finds the words truth and lies have ceased to have any objective meaning. He treats taxpayers' money with contempt.'\par \par \uc2 God spare Britain another hung parliament and more of the same.\par \par \uc2 Despair for justice\par \par \uc2 ANYONE who still has faith in British justice should turn to our report of the compensation awarded to machine-gun triple-killer Kevan Thakrar, who stabbed three prison officers with a broken bottle. Read it, and despair.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140427ea4s00008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage's party attacked by minister over candidate's Lenny Henry remarks ... and still takes new lead in the polls\par \par \uc2 THE UK Independence Party is attracting racist candidates who make "disgusting" and fundamentally "un\u8211\'20\'13British" comments, a Cabinet minister has said.\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, said Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, should denounce one of his candidates who suggested that Lenny Henry, the comedian, should emigrate to "a black country".\par \par \uc2 The gaffe was the latest embarrassment for Ukip, which last week was forced to suspend the "poster boy" of its European election broadcast after it was revealed he had posted a series of racist comments on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . However, weekend polls suggest the rows have failed to dent Ukip's popularity, giving Ukip a lead over Labour for the first time.\par \par \uc2 The survey by YouGov for The Sunday Times gave Ukip 31 per cent of the vote in next month's poll, ahead of Labour (28 per cent), the Conservatives (19 per cent) and the Liberal Democrats (9 per cent).\par \par \uc2 In the latest row, William Henwood, a Ukip candidate for Enfield, responded to a recent speech by Henry in which he suggested that there were not enough black and ethnic\u8211\'20\'13minority people on British television.\par \par \uc2 Mr Henwood said: "He should emigrate to a black country. He does not have to live with whites." Mr Henwood later told the BBC: "I think if black people come to this country and don't like mixing with white people, why are they here? If he [Henry] wants a lot of blacks around, go and live in a black country."\par \par \uc2 Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics that the tweeted comments about Lenny Henry were "absolutely disgusting". He added: "It's for Nigel Farage to make clear that isn't Ukip's official view, but also to explain why so many people with those kinds of views seem to be attracted to becoming candidates for Ukip. I think it is racist.\par \par \uc2 "I think it is totally unacceptable \u8211\'20\'13 he is as British as you and I are. There is a broader risk for Ukip here. They position themselves as a patriotic party, they plaster the Union Jacks all over their leaflets but actually there's something very un\u8211\'20\'13British about this kind of language, very unpleasant. We are not a divisive country \u8211\'20\'13 there are some real dangers for Ukip."\par \par \uc2 He suggested that the rise of Ukip was partly because they were attracting protest votes. He said: "People who want to vote for a protest vote party are angry."\par \par \uc2 But he went on: "Look at what George Osborne has done with the economy since 2010, look at what Iain Duncan Smith has done with the welfare state. Look at what Theresa May has done with \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . These are big changes." Mr Hunt's comments suggest the Tories are changing their approach to Ukip.\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives have been reluctant to criticise the party in recent months.\par \par \uc2 Neil Hamilton, now Ukip's deputy chairman, said the party would investigate the comments.\par \par \uc2 He blamed "social media archaeologists that are employed by Labour, the Liberal party and the Tories to try and track down any unknown Ukip member or activist who may have said something unpleasant on social media \u8211\'20\'13 every party has got them".\par \par \uc2 Labour voters are defecting to Ukip, according to one of Ed Miliband's closest allies. Lord Glasman, a policy adviser, told The Times Labour had become too "middle class" and Ukip would damage them "in the heartlands".\par \par \uc2 Ukip's week of woe: Page 15\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140428ea4s0006j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 A week of woe for Ukip, and yet...\b0\par\par\uc2 Harry Wallop   \par \uc2 1,574 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph\par \uc2 DT\par \uc2 1; National\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 A leader under fire, allegations of racism and unsavoury 'rogue' elements \u8211\'20\'13 but the party still has to be taken seriously by its opponents, reports Harry Wallop\par \par \uc2 The week that Ukip has just endured would finish off most political parties. Since the launch of its campaign for next month's European elections it has been embroiled in a series of gaffes and mounting evidence that some of its members appear to be not just "fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists", as \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  famously described them back in 2006, but very much nastier pieces of work.\par \par \uc2 It culminated over the weekend when William Henwood, standing in a council election for Ukip in north London, reacted to the call from comedian Lenny Henry for more non\u8211\'20\'13white faces in the Arts. Mr Henwood told the BBC: "I think if black people come to this country and don't like mixing with white people why are they here? If he [Henry] wants a lot of blacks around, go and live in a black country."\par \par \uc2 Incredibly, this weekend saw Ukip in the strongest position it has ever enjoyed since its founding in 1993. A YouGov poll for the Sunday Times placed it in the lead \u8211\'20\'13 for the first time \u8211\'20\'13 for the Euro elections on May 22. With 31 per cent of the vote, Ukip is a clear step ahead of Labour on 28 per cent, while the Conservatives are languishing on 19 per cent. The Liberal Democrats are on 9 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Back in 2012, Nigel Farage, Ukip's leader, claimed the party was "the third force in British politics" after it came third in a series of by\u8211\'20\'13elections. By the end of next month, he could be in charge of more British MEPs than any other party, and with a legitimate claim of being able to set the agenda on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and Europe, Ukip's two key policies. Questions will also be asked whether, come next year's general election, this once one\u8211\'20\'13issue party will not only win its first seat at Westminster, but possibly a clutch.\par \par \uc2 It is worth reflecting on what has befallen Ukip in recent days. In the aftermath of reports alleging misuse of EU expenses by Farage, the party launched its campaign last Tuesday with \u163\'00\'A31.5 million worth of hard\u8211\'20\'13hitting advertisements, funded by Paul Sykes, a formerTory donor and one of Britain's wealthiest citizens. With their focus on Ukip's promise to limit \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and how "British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour", critics dismissed the advertisements instantly as ''racist'' and ''divisive''.\par \par \uc2 Later that day, Mr Farage was caught on the hop on the campaign trail by \uc2 Nick Robinson\uc2 , the BBC political editor, who asked him whether employing his German wife, Kirsten, as his secretary was taking a job from a British worker. Mr Farage responded, somewhat lamely and rather unconvincingly, that no one from this country could do a job that required responding to emails in the small hours of the morning.\par \par \uc2 Then, it emerged that the views of Andre Lampitt, a builder who features prominently in Ukip's online video campaign, were, to say the least, unsavoury. In the video Mr Lampitt (himself an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  from Zimbabwe, or Rhodesia, as he prefers to call it) says: "Since the lads from Eastern Europe are prepared to work for a lot less than anybody else, I've found it a real struggle."\par \par \uc2 Courtesy of a basic search by Ukip's opponents on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , it was found that he had also once said: "Muslims are animals their faith is disgusting their prophet is pedophile" (sic), along with other views on Africa, which the party admitted were "repellent".\par \par \uc2 The fact that Ukip used an Irish actor on its billboards to portray a destitute British builder and that it pictured one of its own party workers as a "voter" in its manifesto, are minor slip\u8211\'20\'13ups compared with the views of Mr Lampitt, Mr Henwood or indeed those of Magnus Nielsen, a candidate in Camden, who claimed on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  that: "Islam is organised crime under religious camouflage".\par \par \uc2 But none of this appears to have dented the appeal of Ukip or their leader. Peter Hain, the former Labour Cabinet member, said yesterday that Nigel Farage is "like Teflon Man, nothing sticks to him".\par \par \uc2 Sunder Katwala, who runs the think tank British Future, which debates \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and integration, says: "Ukip has what academics call a 'reputational shield' and for good reason \u8211\'20\'13 most of the public don't believe they are racist. The public take the view they are really quite different from the BNP or the National Front in France."\par \par \uc2 The party itself blames the racist comments over the last week on rogue elements, something that Mr Katwala agrees with. He says: "If you have a policy of controlled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  you will attract mainstream people who hold these quite legitimate views. But you will also attract people who hold extreme versions of those views, and Ukip have never been very good at scrutinising its ranks."\par \par \uc2 And, possibly more importantly, a large section of the electorate appear rather relaxed about any rogue elements, according to \uc2 Tim Bale\uc2 , professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London. "They may appear to be gaffes to commentators, but they are not necessarily gaffes to their core supporters. The other thing, is they are articulating a wider feeling that politics has become disconnected from ordinary people. The key to understanding them is their populism rather than their policies. Ukip's appeal is that they are outside that Westminster elite. Both European integration and the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  we saw under the Labour government play into that feeling, because those are two things that large numbers of people in this country don't agree with, and which were done without really consulting us."\par \par \uc2 He also points out that it is just not possible to attract the support of 32 per cent of voters \u8211\'20\'13 even in a poll \u8211\'20\'13 if drawing from a shallow pool of voters.\par \par \uc2 A new book, Revolt on the Right, by Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin, published this month, finds that Ukip does just as well in former industrial heartlands as in home county golf\u8211\'20\'13club territory, pointing out some of its biggest supporters are former manual workers who feel alienated from mainstream politics. As Prof Bale says: "Farage may be a public schooleducated banker, but he does a much better impression of an ordinary person than the leaders of the other parties."\par \par \uc2 This is not the first time an outside party has seriously rocked the two\u8211\'20\'13party boat in a European election. In 1989, in the dying days of Margaret Thatcher's government, the Green Party caught the crest of both a burgeoning interest in environmentalism and mounting anger about the Poll Tax. It won an eye\u8211\'20\'13catching 14.5 per cent of the vote, coming a strong third, and there was talk that it would go on to win several seats in Westminster so that politics would never be the same again. In the 1992 general election it mustered a mere 0.5 per cent of the vote.\par \par \uc2 Even in more recent years, minority parties have performed very well without ever translating those votes into success at Westminster. In the last two Euro elections, Ukip has garnered more than 16 per cent of the vote on each occasion, but has managed just 3 per cent, at best, in the general elections.\par \par \uc2 Lord Ashcroft, the Tory party donor who regularly conducts his own polls, has recently written: "Voters readily distinguish between elections that matter and those that don't," noting that his focus group participants viewed the European elections with as much seriousness as the Eurovision song contest.\par \par \uc2 It is this knowledge that allows those Conservatives, fearful of electoral disaster in May, to already be writing off the consequences. David Ruffley, Conservative MP for Bury St Edmunds, reacted in such a dismissive fashion to the YouGov poll when interviewed on the John Pienaar show on BBC Radio Five Live: "Well, I don't think we should be too worried. You can't extrapolate from council or Euro elections."\par \par \uc2 But the alarming prospect is that this time it might be different: the old pattern of success in the Euro elections followed by failure at the general election may not repeat itself. The dominance of the twoparty system in Westminster has been steadily breaking down, and minority parties stand a greater chance of, if not winning many seats, then certainly a larger chunk of the vote in 2015. Also, the sheer scale of Ukip's current rating means that it could cause a headache for the Conservatives even if only a fraction of Ukip's expected European support translates into votes in a general election. No wonder, then, that the Prime Minister is under growing pressure from Eurosceptic MPs and those at greatest risk of losing their seats in 2015 to toughen up his stance against Brussels.\par \par \uc2 Prof Bale, who was dismissive of the idea that Ukip played much of a role in denting the Conservatives' chance of an outright win in 2010, warns that exactly that could happen in 2015. "If Ukip doubles its vote from last time [when it got 3.1 per cent], the Tories will start to run into trouble," he says.\par \par \uc2 "They are articulating a feeling that politics has become disconnected from people\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140428ea4s00057\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw119\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1785\pichgoal600

Also, the SNP don't want Farage stealing their anti-mainstream thunder.\par \par \uc2 An ICM poll last week found the SNP comfortably ahead in European voting elections on 37 per cent, down four points.\par \par \uc2 That could translate as three out of Scotland's six MEPs.

But UKIP had gained four points, taking them to 10 per cent support in Scotland. Uh, oh.\par \par \uc2 An increase of just a few percentage points could put Farage in position to have his first MEP in Scotland.\par \par \uc2 UKIP claim they are "within striking distance" of taking a seat the SNP had taken for granted.

CITY AM.   \par \par \uc2 TODAY, \uc2 Silicon Valley Bank\uc2  releases Innovation Economy Outlook 2014, its annual global survey of more than 1,200 executives of fast-growth software, hardware, cleantech and healthcare companies. It offers food for thought for entrepreneurs, investors and policymakers. Thankfully, the main course is a feast of optimism, although challenges remain.\par \par \uc2 Many stereotypes are rooted in fact - some aren't. The broad assumption in the entrepreneurial circles is that entrepreneurs across the Atlantic are more optimistic than those in the UK; this assumption may need revising. Significantly, 84 per cent of UK executives surveyed are planning to grow their workforce this year, compared to 76 per cent in the US.\par \par \uc2 This optimistic outlook is based on facts. Only 6 per cent of UK respondents were unsuccessful in raising capital in 2013, compared with 13 per cent in the US; while three-quarters of UK businesses met or beat 2013 revenue targets. No wonder eight in 10 UK executives think business conditions will continue to improve in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Many of the respondents expect this growth to be on the back of innovation: 37 per cent of UK respondents see offering new products or entering new markets as their greatest opportunity this year, with scaling operations a close second at 30 per cent.\par \par \uc2 THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT For politicians with an appetite for reform, Innovation Economy also points to a couple of areas where there's room for improvement.\par \par \uc2 Debt is seen by many people as something best avoided - at least until you want a mortgage. However, there are times an entrepreneur is better off taking on debt than giving away equity (and vice versa). Among revenue generating businesses, one third of US executives say they took on debt, compared with only 14 per cent of UK executives. This suggests that the British bias against growth through debt remains prevalent or access to debt finance in the UK remains too tight.\par \par \uc2 The biggest challenge for UK innovation economy executives, however, also afflicts other countries: access to talent. The two biggest challenges in 2014 are scaling operations and recruiting and managing talent. The report notes: "While the vast majority of businesses want to hire, virtually all executives have a difficult time finding people with the skills and experience they need."\par \par \uc2 The challenge is acute: 94 per cent of UK respondents consider it extremely or somewhat challenging to find the talent they need to grow; US executives think the talent pool is equally shallow. In this context, the negative political rhetoric and prohibitive visa system for British entrepreneurs looking to access talent outside of the EU is worrying. If our relationship is as special as is regularly claimed, politicians in the US and UK would do well to prove it by making it easier for top talent to travel between the two countries. The wealth of nations isn't solely built on trade and the free movement of capital and goods, but also the free movement of people.\par \par \uc2 Innovation Economy Outlook adds to the growing weight of evidence that there is worsening talent shortage in this country. London Tech Advocates (TLA) recently found that 43 per cent of its members stated that a talent shortage is the biggest obstacle to growth for London's tech sector.

\par\par \uc2 COMMENT\par \b \uc2 Seeking to define voters by their skin colour is sophistry\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ken Olisa   \par \uc2 742 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2014\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFTA\par \uc2 London Ed1\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 When I was growing up in Nottingham in the 1950s and 1960s, politics was easy. People held views about society forged in the second world war. The workers were Labour, the middle class were Conservative and elections were won or lost based on the power of the issues of the day to draw voters to the polls. No more.\par \par \uc2 As Ed Miliband 's appointment of David Axelrod as an election adviser reminds us, 21st-century elections are no longer about ideas and causes: they are about marketing. Calibrate the demographics, follow the focus groups and deploy slogans aimed at the voters' visceral core.\par \par \uc2 A recent arrival at the cynics' ball is a report from think-tank Demos predicting that "ethnic minority voters" will take to the Tories rather than adopt their "parents' reflex support for Labour" as they migrate into mainly white neighbourhoods.\par \par \uc2 Nonsense. The son of a Nigerian law student and his English wife, I have 60-plus years' experience of being black in the UK. And that experience confirms that it is wrong to talk about a community of "black" British voters. A community is a group of people bound by common values and leadership. Black Britons share neither.\par \par \uc2 There is one characteristic I share with the child of Jamaican \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who sailed here on the Empire Windrush in 1948. Equally, a Muslim child refugee recently arrived from Somalia shares only one feature with the third-generation black child at the next desk. This singular commonality is that some people (black and white) think we have something in common.\par \par \uc2 The idea that there is a black "community" in Britain is both wrong and dangerous. It is wrong because being black indicates a shared physical feature but little else. Like people taller than 6ft 6in or born with a heart murmur, we share physical characteristics but lack common culture, values or leadership. It is dangerous because those who think being black is a predictor of behaviour are pandering to a stereotypical analysis, not an evidence-based one. For stereotypical, read prejudiced and thus dangerous.\par \par \uc2 Of course, the idea that voters cannot be defined by a feature as permanent as it is superficial - skin colour - is irksome to pollsters and political leaders alike. It is resisted by many black citizens, too. In many years of public speaking, I have been booed only twice: both times upon pointing out that, in an inclusive society such as ours, seeking to define oneself by colour plays into the hands of those who would suppress us - it reinforces exclusion and victimhood. The hostility came from two quarters: those who believe being part of a downtrodden underclass explains their lack of achievement and justifies a collective sense of victimhood; and those who would like to be anointed leaders of this imaginary community.\par \par \uc2 My hecklers confused being black and British with being black and American. Across the Atlantic, African-American culture revels in tracing its roots back to slavery's injustices. Here, things are different. The annual Powerlist catalogues the UK's 100 most influential black people: leading doctors, lawyers, scientists, civil servants, business people, academics. All are high achievers who live where they want in a free country - and their political views are likely to be formed by arguments, not by their postcode.\par \par \uc2 The idea that black people change their political allegiance when they move to "white" neighbourhoods is offensive both to blacks and non-blacks. It is also anthropological sophistry. Unlike the US, we do not define our districts by colour any more than we do by religion. I live in a neighbourhood populated exclusively by people of African heritage not by choice but because our planet is populated exclusively by people of African heritage. As I learnt at Cambridge, Darwin's Descent of Man presents a compelling case that the origin of the human species is planted in that continent.\par \par \uc2 It is a shame that contemporary politics have drifted so far from their postwar high. I think I am normal - not black - in wanting to be inspired by arguments based on principles proposed by politicians who believe in what they are saying. It is patronising in the extreme for marketing men to discount my intelligence by lumping me into a predictive demographic whose principal unifying characteristic is a propensity to buy hair-straightening products.\par \par \uc2 The writer is chairman of Restoration Partners\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140428ea4s00012\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

Half way through its third government, from 2005-2010, the party had spent just over 370 hours. By the midpoint of this parliament, however, the equivalent figure was just over 284 hours.\par \par \uc2 Labour has already used its maximum allocation of 18 days' worth of opposition day debates in this session, and the government has given them an extra day and a half to fill the time before the next recess.\par \par \uc2 The malaise has got to such a point that backbenchers are beginning to return to their constituencies as early as Wednesday afternoon to complete their constituency casework, and more importantly, begin campaigning before next year's election. For the past two Wednesdays, the Commons has ended before 7pm, three and a half hours earlier than normal.\par \par \uc2 There are several reasons for the relatively empty Commons calendar. One is that it normally takes only about three years for any government to get through its most important legislation. Taking into account time for campaigning, this is why most governments in the past have ruled for four years before calling an -election.\par \par \uc2 Another is that Lynton Crosby, the Conservative strategist, has instructed departments not to spend too much time focusing on issues that are not core to the government's agenda. He has urged ministers to "scrape the barnacles" off their policy agenda and concentrate instead on the Tories' key election themes: the economy; crime; \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ; and welfare. But this has left little legislation to pass.\par \par \uc2 A final reason is that the government is keen to clear space for its MPs to campaign in their own constituencies, especially in marginal seats, with the prospect of the tightest election in decades just over a year away.\par \par \uc2 But Labour's ambush tactics to stop MPs in marginal constituencies being allowed to return home are not guaranteed to succeed. A recent attempt to force MPs into the Commons to vote for the government's controversial badger cull was simply ignored by coalition MPs, with only one member voting for the policy, and hundreds of others boycotting the debate.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140428ea4s0000l\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Neil Lennon stands by under-fire Leigh Griffiths\b0\par\par\uc2 By Michael Baillie   \par \uc2 596 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2014\par 01:01\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 NEIL LENNON has backed Leigh Griffiths after Celtic fans unfurled banners aimed at the hitman\u8217\'20\'19s off-field indiscretions.\par \par \uc2 The flags were produced in front of the section which houses The Green Brigade before Celtic's 6-0 win over Inverness yesterday. One read: 'A man must be a Celt on and off the field otherwise he is of no value to this club', while another stated: 'Refugees welcome, created by \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 '.\par \par \uc2 It was a clear reference to Griffiths, left, after the hitman was accused of racist chants before last month's capital derby at Tynecastle.\par \par \uc2 Lennon said: "We've all made mistakes. But I think the kid will come good. I think he'll learn from it and have a good career here."\par \par \uc2 Griffiths is facing a police probe, an SFA charge and Celtic are also investigating the allegations he indulged in the chant 'Rudi Skacel is a f****** refugee', along with other Hibs fans in an Edinburgh pub.\par \par \uc2 Celtic fined and warned Griffiths after initial footage of him mocking Hearts' financial woes came to light.\par \par \uc2 Lennon added: "I can't comment on the banner because I wasn't sure who it was aimed at. If it was aimed at Leigh, we're going through a process and we'll be able to speak more about it when that process finishes.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know if he was aware that the banner was aimed at him. If he did, we expect those kind of performances from him anyway. That's seven goals in 12 games so he's doing exactly what we brought him in to do."\par \par \uc2 Celtic racked up the league's biggest win of the campaign following an Anthony Stokes hat-trick and further goals from Griffiths, Efe Ambrose and sub Teemu Pukki.\par \par \uc2 Stokes took his tally to 19 and Lennon was full of praise for the Irish hitman.\par \par \uc2 He said: "He's been playing very well. Now he's getting the goals that his all round play deserves.\par \par \uc2 "That's his 19th of the season. More or less every season he's been here he's reached 20 goals so he's been a very important player since I came in the door. And he's improving.\par \par \uc2 "He has a good relationship with Commons and Griffiths. That augurs well for the future.\par \par \uc2 "I've no idea why it's all starting to click.

We've three games left and I'll do my best to get over 20 goals."\par \par \uc2 Stokes has formed a deadly partnership with Griffiths but isn't willing to compare him to Hooper just yet.\par \par \uc2 He added: "It's difficult to compare anyone to Hoops. He was a top-class player and scored 30-odd goals in a season here.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to put any pressure on Griffs but he's come in, been outstanding, scored regularly, got assists and is playing well.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 William Hague entered the independence fray last night, delivering a warning that Scotland faced an uncertain and expensive future in Europe should it break from the UK.\par \par \uc2 The foreign secretary\u8217\'20\'19s remarks were designed to undermine a speech that \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  is due to make in Bruges today.\par \par \uc2 The first minister will arrive in Belgium determined to convince European politicians that an independent Scotland would add value to the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr Salmond knows he needs the support of European leaders if Scotland is to secure the easy and early accession to the EU that he has promised.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hague signalled the start of a campaign to devalue Mr Salmond\u8217\'20\'19s European visit by raising questions about the EU which, he claimed, the first minister had ducked.\par \par \uc2 The clash between the two political heavyweights marks the beginning of a new front in the battle over Scottish independence that puts Europe at the top of the agenda for the first time in months.\par \par \uc2 Mr Salmond has always insisted that Scotland would become a pro-European member state of the \uc2 European Union\uc2  easily.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the first minister has claimed that Scotland would be able to become a full independent member of the EU as soon as it breaks from the UK, in March 2016.\par \par \uc2 The first minister has also argued that an independent Scotland would not have to join the euro and would be able to negotiate a favourable deal on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  too. However, in a letter to Mr Salmond, the foreign secretary argued that an independent Scotland might have to join the euro, might have to wait a considerable time to be allowed to join the EU and would then have to contribute to the financial rebate enjoyed by the rest of the UK.\par \par \uc2 He asked what Mr Salmond\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cplan B\u8221\'20\'1D was if Scotland failed to get into the EU by the time it had broken away from the UK.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hague declared: \u8220\'20\'1CScotland\u8217\'20\'19s negotiations to join the EU are likely to be complex and long and the outcome would certainly prove less advantageous than the status quo.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople in Scotland deserve to have the available facts ahead of making one of the most important political decisions in the history of our Union.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Salmond responded by saying that there would be no problems with Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s accession to the EU. He turned on Tory divisions on Europe by accusing the foreign secretary \u8212\'20\'14 not Scottish independence \u8212\'20\'14 of posing the biggest threat to Scottish membership of the EU.\par \par \uc2 The first minister said that there was no mechanism to force any country into the euro and the timetable for Scotland becoming a member of the EU had been described as \u8220\'20\'1Crealistic\u8221\'20\'1D by one of the \uc2 UK government\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s own top advisers.\par \par \uc2 Mr Salmond added: \u8220\'20\'1CPeople in Scotland can see the advantages of Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s interests being promoted in Europe by a government which is clear about our position, as opposed to a London-based party still riven with division 25 years after Lady Thatcher\u8217\'20\'19s address and who are prepared to put that position at substantial risk.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn this \u8212\'20\'14 as in much other in this debate \u8212\'20\'14 a positive vision is proving far more powerful than the depressing negativity of the London approach.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Today Mr Salmond is expected to emphasise Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s pro-European credentials during his key speech in Belgium. He is due to describe Scotland as \u8220\'20\'1Cone of the linchpins of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D and to say: \u8220\'20\'1COur huge energy reserves, our economic and financial contribution, our fishing grounds, our academic, cultural and social links, and our commitment to the founding values of the European ideal place us at the very heart of the EU.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Salmond is expected to stress the importance of Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s natural energy resources, its fishing waters and its oil reserves as key assets for Europe. He is also due to point out that 160,000 \uc2 European Union\uc2  citizens now live in Scotland. \u8220\'20\'1CPerhaps more than any of this, Scotland shares and promotes the values of solidarity, freedom and democracy that are the heart of the European project,\u8221\'20\'1D he will add.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140428ea4s00008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Britain\u8217\'20\'19s grumpy regions are being ignored. They need to be secure and distinct to live happily in a grand fellowship\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It gives us dignity, respect\u8221\'20\'1D says councillor Bert Biscoe, as Westminster announced Cornwall\u8217\'20\'19s new status as a \u8220\'20\'1Cnational minority\u8221\'20\'1D. Dan Rogerson MP says it ensures \u8220\'20\'1Cthat public institutions take account of Cornwall\u8217\'20\'19s unique identity\u8221\'20\'1D. Well, I love Cornwall, but looking out at a Suffolk sky felt a stab of irritable envy.\par \par \uc2 What about us, then? The Kingdom of East Anglia, children of Raedwald the Wuffing and Edmund the Martyr, rudely subjugated to England a millennium ago, yet an earldom under Thorkell the Tall, whoever he was. Can\u8217\'20\'19t we be a national minority too? OK, there isn\u8217\'20\'19t a language (though listen to the half-Danish lilt at the end of Suffolk and Norfolk sentences and its unique use of verb forms. That doo make you think, bor!). The east has tradition, music, architectural style and a fine suspiciousness: not for nothing is the Norfolk motto \u8220\'20\'1CDo different!\u8221\'20\'1D Like Cornwall, we protrude into the sea, are bounded by rivers and see family names \u8212\'20\'14 Gildersleeves, Prettyman \u8212\'20\'14 on generations of gravestones.\par \par \uc2 The same argument could be made for Durham, Northumberland or Yorkshire. For all our mobile society and small size we are an amalgam of dialects and ancient fealties. Cornwall\u8217\'20\'19s new status may be little but a Lib Dem political wheeze and a lever for EU grants, but other regions feel disregarded too. Incidentally, I notice that the EU definition of national minorities has a clause on \u8220\'20\'1Ccombating discrimination\u8221\'20\'1D, which presumably means \u8212\'20\'14 as when the police investigated Anne Robinson\u8217\'20\'19s dislike of the Welsh \u8212\'20\'14 a possibility of racist accusations. The BBC should quake in fear today after having implicitly, outrageously, in Jamaica Inn accused the Cornish of mumbling incoherently. If East Anglia got status, Steve Coogan would have some explaining to do about Alan Partridge\u8217\'20\'19s Norfolk.\par \par \uc2 OK, I jest. But there is a restless sense of dislocation in the kingdom worth examining. If the Scots vote yes, it will be a huge upheaval; if no, Mr Salmond will claim that they were cowed by wicked \u8220\'20\'1CEnglish\u8221\'20\'1D threats. Meanwhile religious and racial groups are circling the wagons, and across great swathes of the country rumbles envious hostility of the preening capital. It feels as if common citizenship is fading. Easier to say: \u8220\'20\'1CTo hell with emmet furriners, I\u8217\'20\'19m Cornish!\u8221\'20\'1D and the messageboard beneath Petroc Trelawney\u8217\'20\'19s triumphant article on the new status, which dismisses the UK as \u8220\'20\'1Can increasingly random concept\u8221\'20\'1D, is full of other claims, some only half-joking. \u8220\'20\'1CTime that Cockneys became a protected species. We have been slowly driven out of our traditional haunts.\u8221\'20\'1D Even better, the flippant \u8220\'20\'1CI live in Hertfordshire, and Bedfordshire has been oppressing me.\u8221\'20\'1D Another comment suggests that the micro-region boost is \u8220\'20\'1Cthe EU trying to prise another stone from our sense of being British.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 If UK pride is degenerating into grumpy regionalism, our own governments bear much blame. MPs with subsidised London pads prate of \u8220\'20\'1CBritishness\u8221\'20\'1D while letting the capital \u8212\'20\'14 a cultural, political, financial powerhouse \u8212\'20\'14 become overweeningly important. Localism is lip-service: councils are hog-tied, capped, overruled. Westminster can dump a power station or wind farm on you, or dictate education and healthcare. Infrastructure grandiosity prioritises London business: the HS2 rail line will crash through valued countryside, serving only those wishing to streak north for a quick deal and get back to their \u8220\'20\'1Creal\u8221\'20\'1D world. More useful for the north to improve communications between its centres.\par \par \uc2 As for culture, it is not only the dominance of London fine-arts funding that matters, or the BBC carting metropolitan presenters up to Salford. Often overlooked is what the government did to television. The proud old ITV franchises \u8212\'20\'14 Granada, Anglia, Tyne Tees, YTV and the rest \u8212\'20\'14 were duty-bound to meet a quality threshold, serving regional identity. Their programmes were a popular source of pride. But Mrs Thatcher abolished the threshold and threw franchises open to the highest bidder, however scummy. Successive governments welcomed digital rivals and foreign ownership. Now ITV makes no regional programmes bar brief news bulletins (and resents paying for those).\par \par \uc2 Such things erode a sense of belonging. So does the way that high streets are ever more homogenised, identical chain stores everywhere. Business rates are allowed to soar upwards and regulations to proliferate (many of EU origin). Only big corporations with economies of scale can afford much commercial space: idiosyncratic local businesses retreat. In some places the only shopping and eating areas with a strong sense of identity are those dense with \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  cultures.\par \par \uc2 Disorientation creates disunity, a scrabbling for meaning and community. Gordon Brown talked of \u8220\'20\'1CBritishness\u8221\'20\'1D but did not understand, any more than most politicians, the paradox that the more secure a region feels, the more willing it is to be part of a grander fellowship. The kingdom feels most united when respected for its parts, not just its Celtic fringes and ethnically different newcomers. See it as a casket of jewels, heaped together but proudly distinct, each shining.\par \par \uc2 I felt this strongly a quarter of a century ago, sailing with children round mainland Britain in a chilly summer, enjoying every difference of coast, harbour, accent, museum and folk tale from the ragged west to the sandy North Sea coasts, appreciating Orkney and Blakeney, Portsmouth and Polperro. Travelling the encircling sea fed a sense of ownership and, yes, Britishness. \u8220\'20\'1CBetter together\u8221\'20\'1D is not just a slogan for Scotland 2014. But to be really happily together, we must be distinct.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140427ea4s00263\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Fabian pamphlet says Ukip support stems from deep disillusionment with Westminster, and urges handing of more power to local communities\par \par \uc2 Mainstream parties would only see off Nigel Farage's brand of anti-establishment populism if politicians embraced both stricter rules on their conduct and handed power down to local communities, a new Fabian pamphlet has warned.\par \par \uc2 The work has been seen as a further sign that the Left was waking up to the long-term threat posed by Ukip, including a growing belief that Ukip was drawing support not just due to its view on Europe or \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , but from a deep seated disillusionment with Westminster politics and politicians.\par \par \uc2 The Fabian pamphlet stemmed from workshops with groups of non- or swing voters into what had made them disillusioned with politics and what might revive respect for the political class.\par \par \uc2 The research found that "almost every non-voter or swing voter interviewed talked about changing politicians themselves: who they are, the way that they talk and act, and the kinds of issues they prioritise. For many citizens, a lack of trust in politicians not to abuse the system, and a belief that they don't understand the issues that matter to local communities, is an insurmountable barrier to feeling that they have any kind of control over decision-making."\par \par \uc2 The workshops aimed to test ideas that might reduce the democratic deficit. But the voters themselves demanded more to deal with MPs' conduct, suggesting the impact of the expenses scandal five years ago was still potent. The focus groups proposed a stricter set of rules for MPs, restrictions so that MPs had only one job, a requirement to spend more time in their constituencies, further transparency about salary and expenses, and a reduction in the overall number of MPs.\par \par \uc2 The pamphlet pointed out that Ukip was arguably weakest as an anti-establishment party on the issue of expenses, yet few mainstream parties liked to attack it on the issue, arguing it merely reminded voters of the general issue of expenses and so lowered the general perception of politics.\par \par \uc2 The Fabian research into how to address the democratic deficit found that swing voters were most interested in taking power from central government to local councils. They were not highly engaged by the idea of a constituency right to recall MP, or reducing votes to 16.\par \par \uc2 The shadow leader of the Lords, Lady Royall, writing in the Fabian pamphlet, urged politicians to recognise the scale of the problem. She warned that there was a serious danger that populist parties of the right could do so well in the European elections that European institutions would become unworkable. She wrote that the European parliament could be made "near unworkable by the rise of inward looking groups with neither the inclination nor ability to see Europe's democratic institutions work for the people of Europe. Beppe Grillo and Nigel Farage's blends of populism share little, but together they threaten to bring it all to a grinding halt."\par \par \uc2 Politics was viewed by many as a game played by a small elite, with the great majority of people "neither able nor welcome to join in", she wrote, adding that for many voters "many politicians don't sound or behave like normal human beings".\par \par \uc2 David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, called for the GLA and London mayor to be given increased decision making powers for the capital, including the ability to hold on to more of London's tax receipts.\par \par \uc2 He wrote: "On entire areas of policy \u8211\'20\'13 such as childcare or education \u8211\'20\'13 the mayor is barely able to influence what happens in the city they were elected to serve. More powers are slowly being devolved to City Hall, but at a rate that is far too slow and with a scope that is far too narrow. Instead, the London Assembly should be given more fiscal power. London should be allowed to keep hold of the taxes it generates, and its leaders allowed to use that revenue to invest in the city."\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140427ea4s000ji\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 At the beginning of Ned Beauman's third novel, Glow, one worries it might all become a bit overwhelming. There are a lot of similes, perhaps a record number. It's May 2010 and our hero Raf is at a rave in Peckham about to try a new drug called glow for the first time. The powder is wrapped up in cigarette paper like a pork wonton; Raf spies a woman whose cheekbones are like a 1980s computer graphic; he thinks about speaking to her but the room is packed "like a rush-hour Tube carriage that's learned to vibrate to a determinate rhythm". And that's just the first paragraph. It seems an unsustainable density.\par \par \uc2 Individually, these descriptions are often wonderfully evocative. On Beauman's watch, unlovely south London will never again be so romantic: "In the gutter there are diamonds of safety glass," he notes of a smashed windscreen, "with which this morning's rain has mingled an alluvium of damp white blossom and a few fronds of synthetic wig hair caught on a chicken bone, like the shattered remains of a tribal fetish." Collectively, however, they slow the pace; they become more exciting for the author than the reader.\par \par \uc2 Beauman's previous novels - Boxer, Beetle and The Teleportation Accident - were bizarre and sometimes brilliant; the latter was longlisted for the 2012 Booker prize. Now 29, he was the youngest of Granta's Best Young British Novelists of 2013. With Glow, he returns with his first work set in the present day and also a more conventional thriller.\par \par \uc2 Conventional, though, only in relative terms. After Raf's first exposure to glow at the rave, a friend called Theo disappears and he tries to work out what happened to him. It's a conspiracy that ultimately links a London pirate radio station, Burmese \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and a corrupt global mining company called Lacebark - and foxes, skulks of urban foxes. Beauman is especially strong on odd details. In Boxer, Beetle, the protagonist had trimethylaminuria, which made him smell strongly of fish. In Glow, Raf suffers from a rare - but again real - condition called non-24-hour sleep/wake syndrome where his circadian rhythm is set at 25 hours, not 24. The omniscient narrator is on hand with another neat simile: "It's like his brain is wearing a novelty watch."\par \par \uc2 Complex themes are introduced, not least tangents into neuroscience and Burmese history, but we are rarely disorientated for long. The twists, when they come, are unexpected and satisfying.\par \par \uc2 Beauman has an ambition to write powerful, enduring fiction; when he strips away some of the excessive flourishes, he is close to succeeding.\par \par \uc2 To buy Glow for pounds 13.59 with free UK p&p call 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140427ea4r0003s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer Home News Pages\par \b \uc2 Ten years on and Poles are glad to call Britain home: When Poland joined the EU in 2004, a new wave of \uc2 immigrants\uc2  arrived. Now in cities such as Southampton they are a major force in the European elections\b0\par\par\uc2 by Harriet Sherwood   \par \uc2 1,977 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ten years after Tomasz Dyl left his small home town near Krakow as a 13-year-old to start a new life in Southampton, his personal trajectory has become emblematic of the story of Polish migration to the UK.\par \par \uc2 While his parents earned a living picking fruit and packing flowers, Dyl learned English in the playground, launched a marketing business at 17, went on to university, and last year was named Southampton's young entrepreneur of the year. Now 23, he employs six people, is about to collect the keys to a house he has bought on a 25-year mortgage, and cannot imagine ever returning to live and work in his native Poland.\par \par \uc2 "There is a better standard of life here, and the UK gives you more chances. It's fantastic to see the number of Poles starting their own businesses," he says.\par \par \uc2 Ten years ago this week, on 1 May 2004, Poland joined the \uc2 European Union\uc2  along with seven other eastern European countries. The UK was one of just three member states that allowed the new EU citizens immediately to work without restriction within its borders, with the then Labour government estimating that around 13,000 Poles would move to the UK.\par \par \uc2 Actual numbers wildly outstripped forecasts. The 2001 census recorded 58,000 Poles in the UK; by 2011, the figure had risen to 579,000. Since the beginning of this year, migrants from Romania and Bulgaria have swollen Britain's eastern European population, although as yet there is no reliable data on numbers.\par \par \uc2 This influx, and the issues that arise from it, form a central plank in Ukip's campaign for the European elections on 22 May. A poster unveiled on hundreds of billboards across the country last week shows a British builder (who turned out to be an Irish actor) begging for small change. It declares: "British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour". Another says: "26m people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?"\par \par \uc2 Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the campaign was a "reflection of reality as it is experienced by millions of British people struggling to earn a living". A poll last weekend forecast Ukip to win 27% of the vote in next month's European parliamentary elections, three points behind Labour and five ahead of the Tories.\par \par \uc2 Ukip's focus on eastern European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has put mainstream parties on the defensive. Labour has acknowledged its 2004 forecast was wrong. "We should have looked more at the impact on low-skilled jobs and pay," shadow \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister \uc2 David Hanson\uc2  wrote on the LabourList blog earlier this year. He said \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  must be managed and controlled, adding: "We have listened and learned."\par \par \uc2 But, says Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and a former government economist, "overall, the experience [of Polish \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ] has been very positive. Poles mostly came to work, they got jobs, they contributed to the economy, they are less likely to claim benefits. We know from several studies that the impact on employment for native workers was small to zero. There has been some impact on wages at the lower end, but it doesn't seem to have been very large."\par \par \uc2 Not so, says John Denham, Labour MP for Southampton Itchen, who wants a more active political response to issues around \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Day rates in the local construction industry fell by up to 50% initially following the "arrival of a large group prepared to work casually for relatively low wages" in 2004, and fuelled a boom in labour agencies, some geared exclusively to eastern European migrants. "The sense that migration is associated with downward shift in wages is quite widespread," he says. More generally, the addition of around 15,000 people to a city of 200,000 following 2004 "meant a very big and visible change to its fabric and nature".\par \par \uc2 Along Shirley High Street, an area with a relatively large Polish community, the adverts crowding the window of Malinka Delikatesy Polskie are testament to the changing nature of the locality - as well as to the entrepreneurial instincts and self-reliance of the incomers. Polish accountants, travel agents, beauty therapists, dressmakers, computer technicians and car mechanics are among those promoting their small businesses. Marcin Piotrowski, 38, is shopping for his family before heading to work as a housekeeper at Lymington hospital. "My bosses ask me if I have any Polish friends needing jobs," he says. "They want us because we work hard. Not many English people want to do this job, working nights and weekends." Piotrowski came to Southampton eight years ago, and has no intention of returning. "I've bought a house, I have two children at school. I'm happy here. I don't even go back to Poland for holidays."\par \par \uc2 At SOS Polonia, an advice centre established 10 years ago by Barbara Storey, a Pole who has lived in the UK for more than 20 years, migrants were initially "mainly male, fairly young, and single - those old enough to be disillusioned with Poland but young enough to try something new. Then their wives or girlfriends came, babies were born. Now we see grannies coming to look after the children while the mothers work."\par \par \uc2 Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future thinktank, says most Poles come with the intention of staying two or three years, to save money from higher wages than they could earn at home. "But life happens" - better or permanent jobs, mortgages, marriage, children - "and more people stay than expect to."\par \par \uc2 A survey carried out by British Future last December on attitudes to Polish migrants in the UK found that 55% of those questioned agreed Poles "work hard for a living"; 54% said they "make a contribution to Britain"; and 57% said they "don't cause trouble in my community". Only one question, on whether Poles made sufficient effort to integrate, got a negative response, with 35% saying they did against 40% disagreeing. "There is an anxiety among the public about how we handle \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  generally, but most people's immediate experience is OK," says Katwala.\par \par \uc2 Ukip disagrees. On a brief tour of her housing estate in Shirley, local activist Val Aston, 61, lists the problems that she says result from her Polish neighbours: overcrowded schools and health centres, traffic congestion and parking on double yellow lines, litter, noise, excessive drinking, urinating in public, the sound of Polish being spoken on the streets, new private housing developments. One street is regularly blocked by enormous lorries delivering supplies to the Tani Sklep supermarket, she adds. Has she ever been inside the shop? "No, there's no reason to, I don't eat Polish food."\par \par \uc2 Pearline Hingston, the local Ukip chairman - and herself an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  from Jamaica as a child in the 1960s - presents the party's position. "What we have is open-door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from Europe. This is a massive issue when we have one million unemployed young people. I'm not against \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - I'm against uncontrolled numbers, no checks on the quality of people coming in and the impact on the local community. The government's policy of open-door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is bad for this country, and here in Southampton we are feeling the pressures of that policy."\par \par \uc2 As an aside, she adds that "many eastern Europeans are racist to people like me, who have built up the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and transport infrastructure in this country. That makes me very angry."\par \par \uc2 In a nearby cafe, Peter Slack, 71 - born and bred in Southampton and formerly a regular Labour voter - says he will back Ukip in next month's elections. "I'm up to here with it," he says, pointing to his forehead. "I've never met one person who likes the Poles. They come over here and get more rights than local people. The noise, the booze - it's disgusting. But if you say anything about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , you get accused of being racist."\par \par \uc2 Katwala says that Ukip's views resonate strongly with an older generation, "particularly former Labour voters who left school at 16 and feel left behind by today's mainstream parties". In contrast, he says, for young people a diverse society is normal. "There is a generation gap on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and in the end the younger generation will win this debate."\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the city's Poles are putting down roots and channelling money into local economies. "We buy coffees, we drive cars, we rent houses, we go to the supermarket. What would happen if we left tomorrow? Who would bake the bread, paint the houses, clean the streets?" asks Storey.\par \par \uc2 Tomasz Dyl is clear where his future lies. "My mother and father talk about going back to Poland, but I can't see it happening." His father now runs his own decorating business. His sister is a commercial bank manager and homeowner, with a three-year-old British-born child. And Dyl is going nowhere. "My life is here. I have family, a business, and soon a house. I'm a happy guy."\par \par \uc2 A 500-YEAR JOURNEY\par \par \uc2 Poles are now the second-largest foreign-born group of people in the UK, with numbers at a record high following Poland's accession to the EU 10 years ago. But the history of Poles in Britain goes back much further.\par \par \uc2 1500s Polish migration to Britain begins.\par \par \uc2 1795 Polish state disintegrates, causing migration to pick up.\par \par \uc2 1867 First Polish chapel and Polish centre established in London.\par \par \uc2 1918 Polish migration begins to tail off.\par \par \uc2 Only 758 Poles arrive in the UK between 1919 and 1931.\par \par \uc2 1940 Exiled Polish government moves to London during the second world war, along with thousands of soldiers and airmen. Polish pilots join the RAF and fight in the Battle of Britain.\par \par \uc2 1945 About 250,000 Poles stay in Britain, refusing to return to communist Poland. A new surge of anti-Polish feeling leads author George Orwell to warn of a "new antisemitism".\par \par \uc2 1947 The Polish Resettlement Act is\par \par \uc2 passed by the British parliament,\par \par \uc2 offering British citizenship to more than 200,000 former troops and their families. Many Polish clubs are established during this time.\par \par \uc2 1951 Polish population of the UK reaches 162,339, according to the census.\par \par \uc2 1968 Polish communist government expels about 30,000 "undesirables", mainly students, many of whom come to the UK.\par \par \uc2 1981-82 Poles forced from their homeland after the imposition of martial law in the Solidarity era move to Britain.\par \par \uc2 1990s Polish emigration intensifies after the\par \par \uc2 fall of communism.\par \par \uc2 2004 Poland joins the EU. Britain, Sweden and Ireland allow eastern Europeans immediate rights to work; 13,000 Poles are expected, but in fact around\par \par \uc2 1 million eastern Europeans - mainly from Poland - arrived.\par \par \uc2 2014 Three years after the 2011 census puts Britain's Polish population at 579,000, the Polish ambassador to the UK says \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to the UK has peaked. "This huge wave of people who came to EU countries trying to get well-paid jobs is over now. There are more opportunities in Poland. We have had huge economic success, wages are higher and there are more jobs, so I think this is over," said Witold Sobkow.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Clockwise from top left, Polish airmen training with the RAF during the second world war; a Polish shop in Hackney, east London; prayers in the street during an Easter Sunday mass outside a church in Ealing, west London; a T-shirt calls for understanding during a protest against discrimination; arrivals from Poland after its EU accession.\par \par \uc2 Rex, Getty, Alamy, Hulton Archive\par \par \uc2 Tomasz Dyl: 10 years of success in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140427ea4r00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer New Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: THE RULES: AN ETIQUETTE GUIDE TO FAILURE\b0\par\par\uc2 Rafael Behr   \par \uc2 685 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 44\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 'Try again. Fail again," wrote Samuel Beckett as counsel to the unsuccessful. "Fail better." But for anyone not driven by a writer's restless urge to continue producing work even when it goes unrecognised, the alternative advantages of simply giving up should not be underrated.\par \par \uc2 There is a fine line between self-belief and delusion. An equation for calculating where the line falls: if x is the number of rejection letters you have received for your novel/film script/progressive rock opera; and y is the number of years you have lived in the childhood bedroom of your parents' house, and x+y>50, move on.\par \par \uc2 Too big to fail\par \par \uc2 The best careers in which to fail are ones that reward incompetence with a lavish payoff. For example, the current market rate for managing a world-class Premier League football team and failing to qualify for the Champions League is around pounds 5m. For breaking a bank, you should expect something in the order of pounds 10m-pounds 20m. This should include a pension plated in solid gold.\par \par \uc2 Global finance is a particularly good area to fail in because the more vital your institution is to the national economy, the more money you get when it goes wrong. The first rule of receiving a massive taxpayer-funded reward for failure is to show absolutely no contrition. In the event that you are then vilified in public, wallow in martyred self-pity.\par \par \uc2 Public service failure\par \par \uc2 Another good way to grow too big to fail is to run a company specialising in winning outsourced contracts for essential public services. That way, the government has to support you regardless of whether the services you provide are rubbish. Failure in the public sector should be blamed on Tory cuts if you are a public sector employee and public sector employees if you are a Tory.\par \par \uc2 Schools are said to be failing when teachers do not spend enough time preparing for \uc2 Ofsted\uc2  inspections. \uc2 Ofsted\uc2  inspectors cannot fail. Failing schools are then put in "special measures", which means they can become academies. This automatically makes them successful again.\par \par \uc2 Failure in politics\par \par \uc2 Enoch Powell once said: "Political lives, unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture, end in failure."\par \par \uc2 He also advised public speaking with a full bladder and warned that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  could change the colour of major waterways, so his wisdom is open to question. Nonetheless, the rule is a sound one. It can be amended with the note that many political lives also begin with failure and have failure liberally dotted through their middles, too.\par \par \uc2 When MPs fail, it is customary for them to receive seats in the House of Lords. The correct title for ministers and shadow ministers who fail to become leaders of their parties is "one of the best prime ministers we never had".\par \par \uc2 Ministers who oversee failing policies should blame, in this order, the legacy of the last government, civil servants, negative media coverage.\par \par \uc2 Having shifted the blame, it is traditional to declare that lessons must be learned from failure.\par \par \uc2 To establish what these lessons should be, set up a commission of inquiry. Only do this if the inquiry is likely to conclude that the lessons should be learned by someone else.\par \par \uc2 In the event of a chancellor presiding over an economic policy that has failed, one option is to pretend that it has succeeded. This is called "sticking to the long-term plan".\par \par \uc2 Thus, for example, if every one of your growth forecasts and targets for deficit reduction have been missed, simply ignore the fact and state that your plan has worked. (Note: this technique works best with craven newspaper support and pathetic opposition.)\par \par \uc2 Failed state\par \par \uc2 A country run by a dysfunctional regime that doesn't buy arms from the UK or US.\par \par \uc2 Heroic failure\par \par \uc2 What Britain uses to bolster its national self-esteem in the absence of sporting triumph.

Whatever the explanation, it endures.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781405865241"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  The War of the Worlds }}}\par \par \uc2 H G Wells (1898)\par \par \uc2 Does the county of Surrey make quite enough of the fact that Wells\u8217\'20\'19s malevolent Martians first landed in Woking? Or that the hideous creatures in their tripods laid waste to Walton-on-Thames? Like all immortal science fiction, this is rooted in more earthly anxieties \u8211\'20\'13 here, belligerent European rival nations.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781780332413"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  Dracula }}}\par \par \uc2 Bram Stoker (1897)\par \par \uc2 Best enjoyed not as Gothic horror, but as a blazing late Victorian imperial adventure. Jonathan Harker may initially travel to the Count\u8217\'20\'19s eerie fastness in Transylvania, but the Count is intent on some reverse colonisation, coming to London and spreading his undead activities into the very heart of bourgeois English society.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780749394929"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  Titus Groan }}}\par \par \uc2 Mervyn Peake (1946)\par \par \uc2 What must post-war readers have made of the denizens of Gormenghast? Of Lord Sepulchrave, Dr Prunesquallor, Nanny Slagg, and Steerpike? What did all that rich and mad Gothic detailing portend? The imagery remains unforgettable, not least Swelter\u8217\'20\'19s infernal kitchens, and Flay hurling a white cat at Steerpike.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781405882583"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  Brave New World }}}\par \par \uc2 Aldous Huxley (1932)\par \par \uc2 Initially intended as a gentle send-up of H G Wells\u8217\'20\'19s utopian \u8220\'20\'1Cthings to come\u8221\'20\'1D visions, Huxley instead conjured a nightmare 26th-century society of babies grown in \u8220\'20\'1Chatcheries\u8221\'20\'1D, promiscuous casual sex (marriage and families are obsolete) and hallucinogenic drugs. It is frequently pointed out that all such things have come to pass.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781405862417"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  1984 }}}\par \par \uc2 George Orwell (1948)\par \par \uc2 Had Orwell written this one year earlier, we would have associated complete totalitarianism with the year 1974. As it is, Double-Think, Room 101 and the utterly harrowing betrayal of love are attached eternally to every oppressive state regime. Orwell\u8217\'20\'19s warning is undying.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007491513"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  I, Robot }}}\par \par \uc2 Isaac Asimov (1950)\par \par \uc2 A series of spacey stories chronicling the evolution of man\u8217\'20\'19s relationship with robots, and famous for establishing the law that they cannot harm us. What they can do, however, is create tense philosophical and ethical debates about the chasm between mind and machine, intention and consequence.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141185415"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  The Day of the Triffids }}}\par \par \uc2 John Wyndham (1951)\par \par \uc2 A few years before Rachel Carson\u8217\'20\'19s Silent Spring, this vivid horror story about a monstrous plant species with lethal stingers played on our ecological fears. Wyndham was writing as postwar agriculture was becoming a vast chemical-led industrial concern, and the Triffids were payback.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571273577"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  Lord of the Flies }}}\par \par \uc2 William Golding (1954)\par \par \uc2 A boat-load of English boys are washed up on a desert island and have to create a self-governing society, which starts off with the best of intentions but, as ever, human nature will out, and pretty soon they have turned heaven into hell. A human version of Animal Farm.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780450011849"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  Dune }}}\par \par \uc2 Frank Herbert (1965)\par \par \uc2 A saga of off-world dynasties, harsh alien deserts, giant sandworms and an intricately worked-out ecosystem, this sprawling work of imagination made sci-fi mainstream and inspired much environmental thought.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780586044568"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  High-Rise }}}\par \par \uc2 J G Ballard (1975)\par \par \uc2 In arguably his most resonant work, Ballard postulated a tower block that contained everything its residents needed, from shops to pools to offices. They need never leave. And they don\u8217\'20\'19t. The internal society begins to fragment, form classes, and savage civil war breaks out. It is a brilliantly unheimlich urban parable.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780552166591"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  The Colour of Magic }}}\par \par \uc2 Terry Pratchett (1983)\par \par \uc2 The first Discworld novel introduces us to a universe populated by wizards, witches and Death himself. To have these comic stories and gentle pastiches of Tolkien, and everymyth and fairy tale, lapped up by 70 million readers is a spectacular achievement.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099388616"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  Nights at The Circus }}}\par \par \uc2 Angela Carter (1984)\par \par \uc2 An extraordinarily vivid and sensual journey following the circus through 19th-century London and Russia, which brilliantly \u8211\'20\'13 and movingly \u8211\'20\'13 blurs the lines between acute psychological drama, fairy tale and ancient myth.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099511663"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  The Handmaid’s Tale }}}\par \par \uc2 Margaret Atwood\uc2  (1985)\par \par \uc2 Offred is a concubine in a future America where \u8220\'20\'1Chandmaids\u8221\'20\'1D are used to provide children for sterile upper-class women. A tale of institutionalised misogyny and biological tyranny that Atwood explained was not exactly science fiction.\par \par \uc2 Mother London\par \par \uc2 Michael Moorcock (1988)\par \par \uc2 The heroes of this novel have emerged from mental institutions; but do they have special powers? In a narrative that sweeps from the Blitz to modern day, we encounter mindreading, preternatural empathy, and fascinating theories about the people who live under the streets.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780755322817"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  American Gods }}}\par \par \uc2 Neil Gaiman (2001)\par \par \uc2 America is now teeming with gods that have been brought over with each successive wave of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 from Odin to Thor.

The Prime Minister urged Christians to be \u8220\'20\'1Cmore evangelical\u8221\'20\'1D about their faith and claimed that Britain should be a more confidently Christian country.\par \par \uc2 His remarks, in the run-up to Easter, provoked a furious response from atheist and secular groups, and prompted a succession of senior politicians to give their views, culminating in Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, calling for the disestablishment of the Church of England.\par \par \uc2 However, an exclusive poll for The Telegraph today discloses substantial support for the Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s view. Findings from the ICM survey of 2,000 people conducted last week included:\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8201\'20\'09More than half the public \u8211\'20\'13 56 per cent \u8211\'20\'13 regard Britain as a Christian country, a figure which rises to 60 per cent among men and 73 per cent among the over 65s;\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8201\'20\'09Almost two-thirds of practising Christians appear to be frightened of speaking out about their beliefs. The poll found 62 per cent saying the rise of religious fundamentalism had made Christians afraid to express their faith;\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8201\'20\'09Widespread concerns also emerge over the perceived vulnerability of Christians in the UK to abuse or discrimination. Sixty-two per cent of people who hold Christian beliefs but do not worship regularly say they feel Christians are given \u8220\'20\'1Cless protection\u8221\'20\'1D than other religious groups by the state;\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\u8201\'20\'09Overall, 52 per cent of respondents described themselves as either practising or non-practising Christians, while a further five per cent said they belonged to another faith group. Some 41 per cent said they were not religious.\par \par \uc2 In the interview, Lord Williams, now master of Magdalene College, Cam-bridge, accepted that Britain\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Ccultural memory\u8221\'20\'1D was \u8220\'20\'1Cquite strongly Christian\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut [Britain is] post-Christian in the sense that habitual practice for most of the population is not taken for granted,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CA Christian nation can sound like a nation of committed believers, and we are not that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The former archbishop, who remains a member of the House of Lords, continued: \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a matter of defining terms. A Christian country as a nation of believers? No.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CA Christian country in the sense of still being very much saturated by this vision of the world and shaped by it? Yes.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Lord Williams suggested that there may be \u8220\'20\'1Ca further shrinkage of awareness and commitment\u8221\'20\'1D as a result of a lack of knowledge about Britain\u8217\'20\'19s Christian legacy among younger generations, under the age of 45.\par \par \uc2 There may be opportunities for younger people to bring \u8220\'20\'1Ca certain freshness\u8221\'20\'1D to the question of faith because they will not regard Christianity as \u8220\'20\'1Cthe boring old stuff that we learned at school\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 He rejected the suggestion that British Christians have been persecuted, although he acknowledged that some individuals have had \u8220\'20\'1Ca rough time\u8221\'20\'1D as a result of the \u8220\'20\'1Creal stupidity\u8221\'20\'1D of some organisations. His comments are likely to fuel the political controversy which erupted when the Prime Minister made his most outspoken comments about his Christian faith since becoming Conservative leader.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, responded to the debate last week by suggesting that the Church of England should be formally disestablished from the state.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to The Telegraph, Lady Warsi, the senior Conservative peer and the minister for faith, defended the Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s intervention, saying that \u8220\'20\'1CChristianity is part of the landscape of this country and always will be\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 However, she warned that many Christians now feel they cannot display their faith in public. She suggested that large numbers of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from Christian backgrounds, such as Polish Catholics and members of Chinese and African churches, were leading to a religious revival in Britain.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s when countries have a weak identity that things start to go wrong and people start to feel that they are under threat,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSadly that\u8217\'20\'19s what happened in Britain for many years. Politicians didn\u8217\'20\'19t talk about their faith because they were seen to be odd to do so.\u8221\'20\'1D This fuelled a rise in support for far-Right groups in the UK, she said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople say they are drawn to extremist groups because they feel their identity is under threat, that they are not allowed to be who they are or believe what they believe.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat happens because people become unsure of what we stand for in our country. There is still sometimes a sense that the Christian heritage of Britain is not spoken about, not displayed. People don\u8217\'20\'19t feel that they can dress in a Christian manner, can\u8217\'20\'19t talk about Christianity and faith. These groups exploit that feeling and we have to stand up to that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Lady Warsi, senior minister of state at the \uc2 Foreign and Commonwealth Office\uc2  and minister for faith, argued that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  had the potential to strengthen Britain\u8217\'20\'19s Christian heritage, rather than dilute the national faith.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSome people fear that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  somehow makes Britain less of a Christian country, but actually, the opposite is true. \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  has played into the Christian revival in this country.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLook at the facts of church-going today. Some of the biggest church-goers are people whose heritage is in Africa and the Caribbean. We have eastern churches and we have Chinese churches.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere are Roman Catholic churches that have been revived and restored by people who have come to Britain from Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBritain is a Christian country, but you can be Christian of all sorts of background and heritage.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe diversity of Britain is not taking away from Christianity. It has actually led to a revival of Christianity.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Telegraph/ICM poll today discloses that a majority of the public still regards Britain as a Christian country.\par \par \uc2 Some 56 per cent said Britain was Christian, compared with 30 per cent who said they thought the country was \u8220\'20\'1Cnon-religious\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The online survey of 2,000 adults provided further evidence of concerns that Christian beliefs are being marginalised in modern Britain.\par \par \uc2 The poll found that 62 per cent of practising Anglicans and Catholics along with 61 per cent of non-practising Christians agreed that they were afraid to express their beliefs, and 56 per cent of Christians also felt that the state gives less protection to their beliefs than to those of other faith groups.\par \par \uc2 Some 14 per cent of respondents defined themselves as practising Christians, while a further 38 per cent said they were \u8220\'20\'1Cnon-practising\u8221\'20\'1D Christian\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140426ea4q00461\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich38\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal570

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 GERMAINE GREER: TWITTER TROLLS AND ONLINE PORN MEAN WEVE NEVER HAD IT SO BAD AS WOMEN\par \par \uc2 GERMAINE Greer has claimed that women are worse off than ever because of the proliferation of online pornography and the torrent of abuse they have to endure on social media such as \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The sites have become a forum for the loathing of women, says Greer, whose ground-breaking book The Female Eunuch revolutionised feminist thinking in the 1970s.\par \par \uc2 Liberation hasnt happened, even sexual liberation didnt happen, she argues. What happened was that commercial pornography was liberated, fantasy was liberated, but people werent liberated.\par \par \uc2 The Australian academic delivers her damning verdict in a BBC TV documentary " Blurred Lines: The New Battle Of The Sexes " which looks at the threats of rape and violence directed towards women online as well as the objectification of women in violent computer games and sexually explicit pop videos.\par \par \uc2 Greer, 75, tells presenter Kirsty Wark: Things have got a lot worse for women since I wrote The Female Eunuch.\par \par \uc2 She claims the abuse directed at some women online is proof that men are more intolerant of women than ever before.\par \par \uc2 I never thought once you had social media there would become this terrible grab bag of loathing of women, she says.\par \par \uc2 Men are now more aware of women because women keep pushing themselves in.\par \par \uc2 Nowadays women expect to share mens lives, they want to do the same work, they want to play the same games, they want to have the same social life, and I think its driving men nuts. And the result would seem to me to be that men are even less tolerant of women than they were before.\par \par \uc2 Now if men have always needed women to be in a subservient, filial, ancillary position, when they [women] stand up and call attention to themselves, it produces reactions which are difficult to manage.\par \par \uc2 Several high-profile women have suffered abuse at the hands of online trolls. The author and feminist Caroline Criado-Perez was targeted after she launched a petition calling for female historical figures to be represented on banknotes.\par \par \uc2 The campaign was a success and the Bank of England announced that from 2017, Jane Austen would be on a new \u163\'00\'A310 note.\par \par \uc2 But the campaigner found herself inundated with highly personal abuse and threats.\par \par \uc2 At one stage she was receiving 50 threats an hour, and she was so affected that she lost half a stone in two days.\par \par \uc2 Professor Mary Beard was targeted in a similar manner after she spoke out about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on BBCs Question Time last year.\par \par \uc2 The historian had to contend with highly personal comments about her appearance as well as a picture of her face with female genitalia superimposed on it.\par \par \uc2 Prof Beard tells the documentary that such attacks will not deter her from speaking out.\par \par \uc2 She said: You do have to steel yourself a little bit because it is quite affecting when you get this stuff. But most of all it is infuriating. My views on anything are irrelevant to the size and shape of my vagina, Im sorry.\par \par \uc2 Prof Beard is worried, though, that such campaigns may deter other women from entering the public sphere.\par \par \uc2 She said: I have decided I am going to face the music. But there must be loads of women who think, that is not what I want.\par \par \uc2 I dont want that kind of rubbish and its vile. It really is vile. Why would anyone bother to do this unless they were incredibly determined? It is very bad for womens participation in the public sphere.\par \par \uc2 Document MOSM000020140426ea4r0001w\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 OAP falls spark new concerns of ageing Scotland\b0\par\par\uc2 Paula Murray   \par \uc2 514 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Express\par \uc2 THEXSU\par \uc2 1; Scotland\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) Copyright Express Newspapers 2014   \par \par \uc2 THE number of elderly Scots being rushed to hospital after suffering a serious fall has soared to almost 40 a day, sparking concerns about the \uc2 NHS\uc2 's ability to cope with the country's ageing population.\par \par \uc2 According to the latest figures, there were 14,346 emergency admissions among over-75s as a result of a fall last year - up from 13,355 the previous year.\par \par \uc2 The annual total has risen by almost a third over the past decade, while 2,769 elderly Scots have been killed by falls over the past five years.\par \par \uc2 The numbers were unearthed by the Scottish Conservatives, who said the trend highlighted the additional pressures likely to face Scottish hospitals over the years ahead.\par \par \uc2 Health spokesman Jackson Carlaw MSP said: "While it is extremely welcome that people are living longer there are clearly problems emerging with that.\par \par \uc2 "The fact 276 people aged 75 and over are being rushed to casualty every week as a result of a fall is extremely worrying.\par \par \uc2 "Unless we take urgent action, this number will only increase as our population ages."\par \par \uc2 He said the \uc2 Scottish Government\uc2  has been "particularly poor" in planning for the fact that Scotland's population is ageing more quickly than in England and Wales, largely as a result of higher \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  there.\par \par \uc2 Mr Carlaw said that the SNP has to "face up to this demographic timebomb" and added: "As we know from these figures, a fall at home for a frail person can be fatal, but it can also leave lasting impacts for the rest of a person's life.\par \par \uc2 "Our \uc2 NHS\uc2  is already stretched to the limit, so if we can reduce these admissions that would allow nurses to focus on other challenges within our healthcare system."\par \par \uc2 Managing the consequences of falls is already estimated to cost the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and other public bodies in excess of \u163\'00\'A3470 million a year in Scotland alone.\par \par \uc2 Last night, campaigners said that elderly people should be supported so they can live safely and independently for as long as possible.\par \par \uc2 However, they warned that the level of support on offer varies dramatically from one part of the country to another.\par \par \uc2 Some areas have services such as exercise classes to help maintain balance, while other areas have relatively little.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for \uc2 Age Scotland\uc2  said more work and funding is needed to prevent falls, and added: "Falls are the main cause of disability and the leading cause of death from injury among people aged over 75 in the United Kingdom.\par \par \uc2 "They also destroy confidence, increase isolation and reduce independence, often hastening a move into residential care.\par \par \uc2 "Exercise programmes designed to improve strength and balance can lead to significant reductions in falls. But such services are not always available to everyone who needs them at the right time to help them with health and fitness."\par \par \uc2 Over-75s admitted to hospital after a fall 2012/13 14,346 2011/12 13,355 2010/11 13,101 2009/10 12,592 2008/09 12,447 2003/04 10,924\par \par \uc2 Document THEXSU0020140427ea4r000bf\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Editorial; Opinion Columns\par \b \uc2 Vote Tory if you want EU reform\b0\par\par\uc2 Grant Shapps   \par \uc2 1,063 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Express\par \uc2 THEXSU\par \uc2 1; National\par 34\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) Copyright Express Newspapers 2014   \par \par \uc2 THE \uc2 European Union\uc2  wastes too much of your money. It pokes its nose in where it is not needed and it gets too much in the way of British businesses when it should be bending over backwards to help.\par \par \uc2 Conservatives get that. The Prime Minister gets that. I get that. Before becoming an MP I started up a printing firm. It still operates more than 20 years later even though it was a struggle in the early days. When we were trying to hire people red tape, some of it pumped out from Brussels, made it harder to create jobs.\par \par \uc2 Since then working in Government has made me more sceptical about the EU, not less. Radical change is needed.\par \par \uc2 If you are tired of people coming here purely to claim benefits rather than to work, I hear you.\par \par \uc2 If you are sick of EU bureaucrats trying to give prisoners the vote, I hear you.\par \par \uc2 If you think it is about time we brought some powers back to \uc2 Britain's Parliament\uc2  and then had a proper in/out referendum on our membership of the EU, I hear you.\par \par \uc2 If you want real change you have to vote for it. And you have to vote Conservative on May 22 in the European Parliamentary elections.\par \par \uc2 Change will not happen if you vote for Ed Miliband's Labour Party or the Lib Dems because they want to tangle us further in European laws. They want to give more of Britain's hard-won power and prestige away.\par \par \uc2 Change will not happen if you vote Ukip either. It is no surprise that EU President \uc2 Jose Manuel Barroso\uc2  says he "likes" having Ukip MEPs in Brussels because all they do is shout from the sidelines. They cannot deliver anything.\par \par \uc2 Let me deal with Ukip head-on because these elections matter. Nigel Farage may be good with a joke and a pint but he does not have a plan to secure Britain's future, or to get the change in Europe that we need. As he himself admits Ukip cannot deliver anything it says.\par \par \uc2 FARAGE has been taking voters for mugs in this campaign, repeatedly saying one thing and then doing another. He claimed migrants were taking British jobs then hired his German wife as a secretary and left you the taxpayer picking up the bill. He (rightly) attacked EU waste but then voted against \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's plan to slash more than \u163\'00\'A38billion from the EU budget. Farage also claims he is "not a career politician" but has tried six times to become a Ukip MP in Parliament.\par \par \uc2 The list goes on. Farage says \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  needs to be controlled and I agree but he opposed the Government's \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Bill, which is bringing in rigorous new border controls.\par \par \uc2 Farage has tried to claim Ukip is not a racist party. So why did he ask Zimbabwean builder Andre Lampitt, who said Africans should "kill themselves", to appear in Ukip's political broadcasts? Why did he go further and ask Lampitt to stand as a Ukip candidate on May 22? This goes to the heart of Ukip's problem: it is not credible.\par \par \uc2 Here's another example: Ukip claims that reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is one of its "main campaigning issues" because it leads to the discarding of dead fish but when it had a real chance to do something about it and support a proposal in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  to end discards of dead fish, what did it do? Ukip sat on the fence and abstained. Farage did not even bother to turn up.\par \par \uc2 Again and again in this campaign we have seen the same old pattern. Farage is a skilful TV performer but on the serious issues he is making it up as he goes along. Ukip cannot deliver the real changes in Europe that people want to see because it does not have a plan for Britain's future.\par \par \uc2 So what is the Conservative plan? It's simple: Yes to the Single Market.\par \par \uc2 Yes to turbo-charging free trade. Yes to working together where it boosts British jobs. No to benefits tourism. No to "evercloser union" in the EU. No to unnecessary interference on how we tackle crime and justice.\par \par \uc2 Some people say we'll never do it. Well they used to say that about vetoing an EU treaty because it was not in Britain's interests, about getting us out of Labour's euro bailouts that would have cost billions and about cutting the EU budget for the first time in its history. \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  has already delivered these things and he has a plan to deliver more.\par \par \uc2 In a few weeks the polls will open. Think seriously about your vote. Take a long, hard look at the parties. Can they deliver what they say? Are they credible? Do they have a track record? These are critical elections. If you pay your council tax and if you want a real say on Europe your vote matters.\par \par \uc2 BRITAIN is an island. We import 40 per cent of the food we need to survive. We are no longer self-sufficient in oil and gas. Around us the planet is getting more hazardous. A violent crisis is erupting in Ukraine. A brutal conflict is disfiguring Syria and the Eastern Mediterranean. Extreme unemployment is scarring families in southern Europe. Three out of five youngsters in Greece have no work.\par \par \uc2 Britain needs serious leaders for serious times. Security cannot be taken for granted. Prosperity is not something guaranteed just by pulling a lever in the Treasury. We have to work for it: maintaining our energy sovereignty, keeping a tight control on our borders and locking in recovery at home by working through the Government's long-term economic plan.\par \par \uc2 Only the Conservative Party and our Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , with a strong team of Conservative MEPs in Europe, can and will deliver economic security at home, real change in Brussels and a better future for Britain.\par \par \uc2 Crucially we will give you the final say: either to remain in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  or to leave it. However first you have to vote for it and you have to vote Conservative on May 22.\par \par \uc2 'Nigel Farage has been taking people for mugs and making it up as he goes along'\par \par \uc2 Document THEXSU0020140427ea4r0004e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

\par\par \uc2 Editorial; Opinion Columns\par \b \uc2 Teachers' conference provides lesson in why schools fail our young\b0\par\par\uc2 KEVIN MYERS   \par \uc2 1,149 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 1; Ulster\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Aperfectly serious proposal: if you saw your child's teacher at one of the recent conferences heckling, abusing or booing the lawfully elected minister for education Ruair\u237\'00\'ED Quinn, urge your offspring to behave in precisely the same way in class. Oh yes, with placards and stuff. If a teacher was using a megaphone to interrupt the minister's speech with questions, ask your child to do the same \u8212\'20\'14 for don't teachers want their pupils to be inquisitive and follow their own splendid example? Having a reasoned debate about the teaching profession is like having one about flags at an Ardoyne interface. The problem is the Socratic ideal \u8212\'20\'14 for by that measure, teachers are the most important element in any society, the very vectors of civilisation. And truly, a good teacher is culture's purest jewel.\par \par \uc2  Oliver Goldsmith's teacher, Maguire \u8212\'20\'14 "and still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, That one small head could carry all he knew" \u8212\'20\'14 was the quintessence of those generations of Irish teachers that turned peasants into scholars. And without the inspiration of Henry Stokes at Grantham Grammar School, Isaac Newton would probably have been merely a rustic failure, toiling unhappily on the Lincolnshire fens. The fortunes of a later Grantham youngster were similarly transformed by the far-sighted teachers that helped Margaret Thatcher to a doublefirst; she was both the first science graduate and the first woman at No 10 Downing Street.\par \par \uc2 And yes, it must be utter hell trying to teach the very opposite, the pathologically uneducable, or keeping order among gangs of hormonal sabre-toothed teenagers, for whom the word "pupil" is as apposite as "mut" is for a pitbull with a baby koala clenched bloodily between its jaws.\par \par \uc2 There. I've thrown the teachers a kindly bone about the Socratic ideal, so now to the suckers' deal we've done with them. For teachers are among the most protected, most cosseted yet most aggrieved group in society. Come a gentle dusting of snow, which institutions close first? The schools, always, and probably not at the instigation of the heads, who may usually be found sweeping away the snow at dawn, but of the unionised staff, texting from bed. Two-job parents (who'll still be going to work anyway, adjoining schools and workplaces apparently having completely different climates) will suddenly have to arrange childminders.\par \par \uc2 The recent revelation that Ireland''s 15-year-olds came 17th out of 22 OECD countries at problem-solving would have surprised no one who's had the annual pleasure of witnessing our teacher unions' conferences. So naturally, what is most educationally-vital in deprived areas, a drastic reduction of class sizes, has quite simply never been No 1 priority for the unions. For according to The Unwritten Public Service Code, the primary function of any government-run organisation is the improvement of the work conditions of its employees, not the discharge of the public duties for which it was created. HSE, anyone? Moreover, it always helps to be ignorant: \uc2 Irish National Teachers' Organisation\uc2  (Into) delegates last week voted for the pension levy on public servants to be phased out, on the grounds that it was an unfair and selective charge on them.\par \par \uc2 A word in your shell-like, gentle teachers: we in the private sector pay for our own occupational pensions entirely. And far from getting the whopping subvention from the state's current account that makes public service pensions so generous, our own painfully-acquired pension funds have actually been raided by the finance minister to help pay for your public service pensions.\par \par \uc2 Next, holidays, which for secondary schools are: 12 weeks in the summer, two mid-term week-long breaks, a fortnight for both Christmas and Easter, plus various days for teacher-parent meetings, also mandatory term-time cross-border shoppingtrips, also known as "action days".\par \par \uc2 And teachers cry: Why are the media always so howwid to us? Actually, we're not. We usually treat teachers as gently as we would shipwrecked orphans found sprawled on the high-tide mark, because they're extremely well organised, and if crossed are as vituperative as a Siptu polecat with weeping piles (viz next week's letters' page).\par \par \uc2 We must now ask serious questions about our educational failings. For example, why are we now unable to produce enough maths graduates to run our economicallyvital high-tech industries? Is it because \u8212\'20\'14 as Quinn hypothesised \u8212\'20\'14 teaching has been feminised, and (unspoken subtext) women can't do sums? But as poor battered Ruair\u237\'00\'ED soon discovered, not merely do the teachers' unions not let you wonder, but his unscripted question is now the subject of endless PC media sneers. So what hope is there, when liberal journalists and teachers' unions conspire to prolong ignorance? But credit where credit is due. Working heroically together, Irish parents and teachers have managed to create a vast underclass of obese illiterates, who if found waddling in Faroes' waters would probably be herded into a bay and harpooned. (Viking culture, apparently.) And on the other side of the class divide, we have the stunningly stupid I'mlikes, Omigods and Totes infesting the Dart and Green Luas, like a linguistic fallout from a Californian Chernobyl. By contrast, consider the \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  graduates of Polish schools who run our retail economy: sweet, lissom, industrious young women who speak seven languages, including perfectly modulated 1950s English.\par \par \uc2 Of course, we all know that teachers are not entirely responsible for all that ails us, but they can't complain if they get the blame, because a) it's fun and b) they routinely exhibit the PR skills of Pyongyang on poitin. This, presumably, is why they insist on flaunting their differences during the Easter hols, precisely when both politics and the courts are in their seasonal comas, and we media-vampires are in urgent need of a haemoglobin top-up.\par \par \uc2 Maybe the teachers' worst indiscretions occur through species-assimilation; just as poolside zookeepers become indistinguishable from walruses and nurses soon resemble bedpans, teachers invariably end up imitating the Hutu militia that is 5C. This is the class where the brightest boy can actually spell his initials, and there's a good reason why one girl at least isn't pregnant: she's just given birth to multi-ethnic triplets in the very stockroom where they'd been conceived, courtesy of several swains called Wayne or Dwayne. And though she's not quite sure which happy three may now be called Daddy, all have again gallantly clustered round, to do the needful if called upon.\par \par \uc2 No, it's not easy being a teacher these days; so each Easter, why do teachers insist on making it even harder? kevin.myers@sunday-times.ie\par \par \uc2 TEACHERS ARE AMONG THE MOST PROTECTED, MOST COSSETED YET MOST AGGRIEVED GROUP IN SOCIETY\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140427ea4r0010u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 FLAWED CRUSADE Pope Francis's social-policy adviser Margaret Archer wants trafficked women to be allowed to get residency and citizenship in the West because, she says, "They did not come here voluntarily; they are not illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 " ("Woman takes lead in Pope's crusade", News, last week). However, almost all have been smuggled, albeit with the promise or hope of decent work. Of course they must be rescued from the abuse they find themselves in, but then deported. Pope Francis has described himself as "the pastor of a church without frontiers". He should not be listened to on the subject of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . \u193\'00\'C1ine N\u237\'00\'ED Chonaill \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Control Platform, Dublin 2 GUITAR GRATES On his piece on Bernard Butler last week ("A new string to his axe", Culture) Dan Cairns describes the Fender Stratocaster as "arguably one of the least loved of all guitars". Eh? The list of famous Stratocaster lovers is lengthy, but to name just a few: Buddy Holly, Hank Marvin, Jimi Hendrix.\par \par \uc2  The Stratocaster may not have the faux-coolness bestowed on some other guitars by indie acts (Jaguar? Please!), but those of us who have fallen under its spell would beg to differ with Cairns's opinion. Se\u225\'00\'E1n O'Flynn Kilcolgan, Co Galway CAUTION ON CANCER TESTS I support your campaign to beat cancer, but when discussing early diagnosis we must differentiate between screening tests and those used to investigate patients presenting with symptoms ("Young die as \uc2 NHS\uc2  rules deny them cancer tests", News, April 13). In Britain screening for cervical cancer is restricted to those over 25. Medical literature demonstrates that routinely performing smear tests on women younger than this age does little to reduce rates of invasive cancer or mortality, but does increase the number of false positive results obtained \u8212\'20\'14 along with all the attendant harms that spurious results bring about (further invasive investigations and unpleasant treatments). Conversely a young woman presenting to her doctor with symptoms that are suggestive of cervical cancer should, of course, be offered appropriate and timely investigation, regardless of her age. Dr Liam Scott Cheltenham, Gloucestershire GOING TO EXTREMES What evidence does William Shawcross, chairman of the Charity Commission, have for his assertion that "Islamist extremism" is a growing problem for UK charities ("'Deadliest threat' to charities is extremism", News, last week)? A recent survey of Muslim aid agencies by us found that 88% had regulations in place to prevent the financing of terrorism and had adopted measures to protect against terrorist abuse. Our members are vigilant in working to ensure that material aid and funding do not get into the wrong hands. Shawcross says Islamist extremism is not the most widespread abuse that charities face, so why not focus on what he believes the most rife problem to be? Dr Hany El-Banna OBE Chairman, Muslim Charities Forum, London W5 Letters should arrive by midday on Thursday and include the full address and a daytime and an evening telephone number.

Tory jitters will be stoked by today's YouGov poll for The Sunday Times on the EU elections, which puts UKIP in the lead for the first time, with the Conservatives trailing a distant third.\par \par \uc2 Despite a week of controversy, Nigel Farage's party has risen to 31%, three points clear of Labour, with the Tories languishing on a lacklustre 19 points.\par \par \uc2 In another blow to the prime minister, the former Tory donor backing UKIP has indicated that he will bankroll the party at the next general election \u8212\'20\'14 boosting Farage's chances of winning seats at Westminster for the first time.\par \par \uc2 Paul Sykes, who is worth \u163\'00\'A3650m, according to next month's Sunday Times Rich List, and is among the 200 wealthiest people in Britain, also revealed that he had funded "at least another two waves" of UKIP adverts before the European elections.\par \par \uc2 The prime minister, in a newspaper article last month, detailed the powers he wanted to reclaim from Brussels before his proposed in/out referendum in 2017. They included demands to stop "mass migrations" when new countries join the EU, curbs on benefits for EU migrants, and "red card" powers for national parliaments to join together to block future EU laws.\par \par \uc2 But senior backbenchers on the Eurosceptic right are preparing to tell the prime minister that he must address the issue of border controls for existing EU migrants, the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 's attempts to impose the Charter of Fundamental Rights on Britain and the need for national vetoes of existing European laws.\par \par \uc2 A senior Downing Street figure has revealed, however, that Cameron will refuse to spell out further red lines.\par \par \uc2 In a move that will enrage many, Cameron has privately stated that he has no intention of placating the Eurosceptics.\par \par \uc2 The new poll shows that it is the MPs not the prime minister who have public support: 42% of voters do not think his plans for renegotiation go far enough, against 25% who say they are about right.\par \par \uc2 A total of 56% of voters think curbing \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  should be the top priority for Cameron's new deal with Brussels \u8212\'20\'14 a view that Farage has exploited.\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140427ea4r000z4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Tim Shipman, our new Political Editor, reveals how party rebels have tweaked a simmering revolt: ousting Cameron is off, making him Eurosceptic is on\par \par \uc2 IN EARLY February a group of Conservative MPs gathered in one of the wood-panelled dining rooms overlooking the Thames in the House of Commons. The food was the usual combination of red meat and warming claret but the real subject on the menu was the fate of \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 If fine dining is still top of the list of favourite activities for many Tory MPs, second is plotting. Recently there has been plotting aplenty.\par \par \uc2 For six months or more, Tory MPs have contemplated the prospect of the European and local elections on May 22 with grim expectation, predicting humiliation by UKIP and a meltdown in party discipline thereafter.\par \par \uc2 For those who endure rather than enjoy Cameron's leadership it has always been his moment of maximum vulnerability. Like Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff who is now mayor of Chicago, they vowed they would "not let the crisis go to waste".\par \par \uc2 In the weeks either side of Christmas, small conclaves of two or three Conservative MPs held what one of the participants calls "regicidal conversations", engaging in "brutal war-gaming" about whether it would make sense to oust the prime minister if the voters punish him next month.\par \par \uc2 By February they had decided that "Get Cameron" was a game with no winners. One plotter said: "They concluded that moving against Cameron would not be regicide; it would be suicide. With a year to go until the general election no one will do any better."\par \par \uc2 So the Thatcherite No Turning Back group and the socially conservative Cornerstone group dined together in February with a new goal. Now that ousting Cameron was no longer in prospect, they were scheming to make him the leader they want him to be.\par \par \uc2 The results of that dinner \u8212\'20\'14 and others since \u8212\'20\'14 will shape the gruelling 13-month campaign that begins this week and culminates at the general election on May 7 next year.\par \par \uc2 The European election will be a test of leadership for Cameron, but also for Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage and Ed Miliband. How they perform and how their restless colleagues react will go a long way towards deciding the colour of the next government.\par \par \uc2 Voters will be choosing 73 MEPs and 4,216 councillors. For UKIP it is a chance to top the polls for the first time and solidify grassroots operations.\par \par \uc2 For Labour the European vote is a diversion from the serious business of gaining council seats and road-testing its general election message on the cost of living crisis in battlefield conditions. If it can capture Tory council seats in southern towns such as Crawley, Swindon and Milton Keynes, Miliband will quell doubts about him that linger even in his shadow cabinet.\par \par \uc2 For Nick Clegg, May 22 will be a grim fight for survival amid warnings that he could lose all his 12 MEPs and 300 or more councillors.\par \par \uc2 WHEN the prime minister decided to "roll the dice" 18 months ago and offer to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels before an in/out referendum in 2017, he bought himself time and gave Tory Eurosceptics something to unite behind.\par \par \uc2 If he hoped to neuter UKIP and stop the carping from the Tory wings, he demonstrably failed. Today's YouGov poll for The Sunday Times puts UKIP out front in the race for MEPs on 31%, an emphatic 12 points ahead of the Tories.\par \par \uc2 Why then is there no knife between Cameron's shoulders? Although only 20 to 24 people attend the No Turning Back-Cornerstone dinners, the two groups include about 120 MPs, a third of the parliamentary Conservative party and more than enough to trigger a leadership challenge.\par \par \uc2 It is the economic upturn that has saved him, as a rebel conceded over lightly poached fillets of salmon at the Rex Whistler restaurant in the \uc2 Tate Britain\uc2  gallery, a short hop down the Embankment from the House of Commons.\par \par \uc2 "Cameron is seated on a stool with four legs," said this ally of Adam Afriyie, the backbencher who was accused last year of plotting against the prime minister.\par \par \uc2 "He needs to keep the party above 30% in the polls. He needs to lead Ed Miliband on the question of who would make the best prime minister. He needs us to stay ahead on the economy and he needs to personally poll better than the party."\par \par \uc2 Cameron is currently passing each of the four tests.\par \par \uc2 "The tide has turned in Osborne and Cameron's direction," says one MP present at the No Turning Back dinners.\par \par \uc2 "Third place in the Euros will be highly embarrassing but is it going to lead to a total meltdown? No. The economic upturn has convinced a lot of people to beat their swords into ploughshares.\par \par \uc2 "It's too late to start talking about changing leader. There is no obvious candidate to replace Cameron. It might be different if Boris were in parliament now but he isn't."\par \par \uc2 Aware of complaints of aloofness, Cameron has been inviting recalcitrant backbenchers to Downing Street. "You get a bit of a stroking and a pat on the head," one MP said. "The general effect is vaguely patronising but I suppose we should be encouraged that he is bothering at all. He did at least know my name."\par \par \uc2 For his part Cameron has been encouraged by the outbreak of common sense in the party. He has taken to telling visitors to Downing Street of his pleasant surprise when \uc2 Stewart Jackson\uc2 , the periodically rebellious Eurosceptic, announced that he would not be causing trouble.\par \par \uc2 But if \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 's economic strategy has saved Cameron from a leadership challenge this summer, the referendum pledge whetted backbenchers' appetite for more concessions on Europe. This shows no sign of being sated.\par \par \uc2 Senior figures such as Bernard Jenkin, Gerald Howarth and John Redwood are biting their tongues to avoid appearing disloyal during an election campaign. But the No Turning Back-Cornerstone table talk is about how to force Cameron to offer more red meat on Brussels.\par \par \uc2 One regular diner said: "After polling day you are going to get delegations of serious people visiting Cameron pushing for more red lines on Europe."\par \par \uc2 The Eurosceptics want parliament to be able to overturn existing Brussels laws and curb \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from the EU. Howarth, Jenkin, Redwood and Bill Cash, chairman of the European scrutiny committee, have all told colleagues they will take this up with Cameron after polling day.\par \par \uc2 The historical model is not the execution of Charles I but the baronial revolts that led to Magna Carta. "The points we want to impress upon the prime minister are the same as those that were made to King John," the MP said. "We need a statement of the rights of Englishmen against the diktats of the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 . Cameron can't beat us so he should join us."\par \par \uc2 THEY will not be the only noises off. The European poll will cause jitters among Tory MPs in marginal seats who regard Eurosceptic ideologues with large majorities as selfindulgent dilettantes. "There will be much wailing and gnashing of teeth," one loyalist says. "It will be squeaky bum time in the northern marginals."\par \par \uc2 One MP fighting Labour in the north said: "We don't need more Eurosceptic games. The sooner Bernard Jenkin's razor slips while shaving, the better."\par \par \uc2 Cameron's problems are minor, however, compared with those facing his deputy. The Liberal Democrats are set to lose about 300 local councillors. From a peak of 4,743 in 2005, the party is likely to go into the general election next year with fewer than 2,300.\par \par \uc2 When candidate nominations for council seats closed on Thursday evening, the Lib Dems appeared unable to field a full slate. The political analyst Rob Hayward said: "In a number of places the Lib Dems have fewer candidates than UKIP \u8212\'20\'14 places like Salford, Doncaster, Tameside, North Tyneside and even Liverpool."\par \par \uc2 A Lib Dem minister warned that the party's grassroots infrastructure was collapsing. Away from its strongholds "we are disappearing like ice in the sun".\par \par \uc2 Clegg is facing warnings from his own MPs that wipeout could cost him his job. Vince Cable, the business secretary, has told friends his "time is running out" if he is to be leader. An MP who supports Clegg said: "Vince is capable of anything if things get bad."\par \par \uc2 For Miliband, success is assured in the local elections, but he has much still to prove.\par \par \uc2 "Ed just has to look like he can walk and chew gum at the same time and that will be progress," says one frustrated frontbencher. "We've been coasting. As long as we can show some progress in the south, people will be reassured."\par \par \uc2 Miliband may face pressure from within to offer a European referendum if Labour comes behind UKIP in the European elections, but he shows no sign of budging.\par \par \uc2 "It's the Tories who have the problem with Europe, not us," says a member of the shadow cabinet.\par \par \uc2 It is hard not to agree. Cameron will survive a European election debacle. What he may not survive is the implacable demands of the dining clubs.\par \par \uc2 As one attendee explains: "We on the right of the party know that Cameron really wants to stay in the EU and, come what may, we know he isn't going to get a proper deal.\par \par \uc2 "He is going to argue passionately for the UK to stay in on slightly better terms. If he does get over the [general election] finishing line in 2015, he's going to be leading a divided party that is going to be split down the middle."\par \par \uc2 An ally of Cameron's predicts he will be deposed by the Eurosceptics sooner or later after the general election. "They'll come for him unless we win a majority. Even if he wins and leads the 'stay-in' campaign during the referendum, the party will split and they'll come for him."\par \par \uc2 If he has to negotiate another power-sharing arrangement he will have to take a tougher line on Brussels to get a new coalition agreement past his backbenchers. One dormant rebel says: "If it's a Con-Lib government, Cameron won't be able to stroll into Committee Room 14 like he did last time around and say, 'We're going into coalition, chaps.' "We want a secret ballot to approve any deal and if he won't do what we want we'll vote it down and he'll have to go. People would say, 'We'll have a coalition, but not with you leading it, Dave'."\par \par \uc2 Knock 'em down but UKIP keeps coming, Editorial, page 18\par \par \uc2 EVEN IF HE WINS THE ELECTION, THE PARTY WILL SPLIT AND THEY'LL COME FOR HIM\par \par \uc2 State of the parties Yes 25% No 66% Are the UKIP posters racist?

\par\par \uc2 HS - News\par \b \uc2 Criminals in the shadows of the business world\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Leask   \par \uc2 1,965 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Herald\par \uc2 SUNDHE\par \uc2 1\par 36\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014, Herald & Times Group   \par \par \uc2 FOR generations their tentacles have reached the sleazier end of the entertainment, private hire taxi and security industries. But Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s underworld, enriched by three decades of lucrative but high-risk heroin smuggling, is now diversifying deep into the legitimate business world.\par \par \uc2 This week it emerged gangs, many Glasgow-based, had taken control of chunks of Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s booming payday loan market, putting the \u8220\'20\'1Cextortion\u8221\'20\'1D firmly into extortionate interest rates.\par \par \uc2 No longer just looking for easy cash businesses \u8211\'20\'13 the traditional car washes and tanning salons \u8211\'20\'13 to launder their money, organised crime groups are looking for easy profits in new industries where their disrespect for the law gives them the edge.\par \par \uc2 Assistant Chief Constable \u173\'00\'ADRuaraidh Nicolson, of Police Scotland, said: \u8220\'20\'1CPeople have got this view that organised crime is only involved in drugs and guns. But actually they are involved in much, much more than that. They are looking at the how to use the competitive advantage they have by not feeling bound by any legislation. They can undercut any legit company in this country and compete for contracts, for work, whatever and make very little contribution back into society and the economy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Crime gangs have an advantage in the payday loan business. Operating from on-street premises in the poorer parts of Glasgow, they know few will feel able not to pay them back. Not for them, say sources, the niceties of rules set up by new regulator the \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  (\uc2 FCA\uc2 ). John Cuddihy, Police Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s head of organised crime and counter-terrorism, stressed that owning debt enabled gangsters to effectively own their clients. He said: \u8220\'20\'1CCrime groups will attempt to control the economic well\u173\'00\'ADbeing of the entire community.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18\u8216\'20\'18We see individuals who have been put into a house owned by organised crime. If they fail to make the rent they are simply directed towards a payday loan from a firm owned and controlled by the same crime group.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The move into legitimate business \u8232\'20\'28may offer a safer form of business for gangs. Get caught dealing in drugs and you can face a decade in jail. But gangsters involved in evading hundreds of millions of pounds in landfill tax by building illegal tips risk far less: no \u173\'00\'ADcriminal landfiller has been imprisoned to date.\par \par \uc2 But that does not mean Nicolson and Cuddihy \u8211\'20\'13 and their partners at \uc2 Scottish Environment Protection Agency\uc2  (Sepa)and the Crown Office \u8211\'20\'13 aren\u8217\'20\'19t vigilant.\par \par \uc2 Cuddihy said: \u8220\'20\'1CThere are opportunities in green energy and waste management. They will move in to these areas because they are driven by supply, demand and profit. Profit is their god. Money is their god. That veneer of respectability is always there. But we have to look under that to find organised crime.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIllegal landfill can have the same long-term impact as drugs. It will manifest itself in different ways ... in the pollution of our environment. But an organised crime group could not care less about the harm it causes.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Such semi-legitimate businesses may offer opportunities for Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s gangs but they do the same for the law enforcement agencies pursuing them. Because Police Scotland can now work with regulators \u8211\'20\'13 such as Sepa or the \uc2 FCA\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 to target what are now the soft under\u173\'00\'ADbellies of criminality. Cuddihy said: \u8220\'20\'1COther \u173\'00\'ADpartners can target-harden sectors to make it difficult for organised crime to infiltrate them.\par \par \uc2 WASTE DISPOSAL AND ILLEGAL LANDFILL\par \par \uc2 Where there\u8217\'20\'19s muck, there\u8217\'20\'19s brass. Organised crime groups have long used skip hire and small-time waste disposal as a front. This kind of cash business was great for laundering income from drugs or racketeering. And it was also an area where cutting corners \u8211\'20\'13 essentially flytipping \u8211\'20\'13 provided a huge competitive advantage. However, soaring landfill taxes have provided what legitimate industry players believe is a real incentive to dig illegal tips across Scotland. Some unauthorised dumps \u8211\'20\'13 typically disused quarries, coal mines or railway cuttings \u8211\'20\'13 are on a major industrial scale. The creators are so brazen many people affected by the sites assume they are legitimate. The \uc2 Scottish Environment Protection Agency\uc2  has admitted it is now on the front line of the war against the underworld and is working increasingly closely with other parts of law enforcement to tackle this.\par \par \uc2 PUBS, CLUBS, SAUNAS AND ADULT ENTERTAINMENT\par \par \uc2 It won\u8217\'20\'19t surprise anyone that gangsters invest in pubs and clubs. The \u8220\'20\'1Clocal\u8221\'20\'1D owned by an underworld figure in poorer housing schemes is almost an organised crime cliche. Such businesses are classic fronts for criminals and also important bases, a marker of their control of their turf. But on a larger scale, major crime groups need influence, if not ownership, over the sector. Why? Because \u8211\'20\'13 aside from their own profits and cash sales \u8211\'20\'13 pubs and clubs can be important venues for illegal business, from drugs to prostitution.\par \par \uc2 Saunas and adult entertainment venues and businesses, including escort agencies, have traditionally been used as cover for narcotics and the vice business, either on site or elsewhere. Police in recent years have become particularly concerned with the danger of human trafficking involving those officially involved in the escort business as Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s prostitution moves off-street in to one-woman flats. The sector is increasingly \u8211\'20\'13 and sometimes controversially \u8211\'20\'13 receiving attention from law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 CAR WASHES, GARAGES\par \par \uc2 Dirty money is keeping Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s motors clean. For years carwashing has been one of the easiest way to launder money from organised crime. As viewers of the US TV drama Breaking Bad will have learned, it is the perfect cash business with low overheads and start-up investment costs \u8211\'20\'13 all you need is a tap, an easily drained bit of asphalt and some buckets. Crucially, it is impossible for any authority to check how many cars have actually been washed, and so it is easy to put cash from drug deals through the books of such a business. The mere hint of organised crime involvement in a local car wash makes it a difficult business to compete in. In recent years, car washes have also raised concerns that \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  labour is being exploited.\par \par \uc2 Organised crime has a long-standing interest in the motor trade. However, new disruption tactics have seen regulators, such as the \uc2 Vehicle and Operator Services Agency\uc2 , used to strip the frontmen of organised crime of their licences to carry out MoTs or operate in the sector.\par \par \uc2 TAXIS AND BUSES\par \par \uc2 Taxis and more frequently private hire cars are another cash industry widely seen as being infiltrated by organised crime. The sector has also been the focus of considerable police and government action to clean it up in recent years, with fit-and-proper-person tests not just for drivers, but also for those operating radios in control centres. Taxis, however, aren\u8217\'20\'19t just good for money laundering. Like pubs and other front businesses, they can provide supposedly legitimate sources of personal income for gangland footsoldiers. Taxis can also play an important role in providing logistic support to drug-dealers, and act as a street-level symbol of control for organised crime groups on their turf.\par \par \uc2 Organised crime groups have also diversified into the bus industry since it was deregulated.\par \par \uc2 HAULAGE, WAREHOUSING, MARKETS AND LOGISTICS\par \par \uc2 Criminals need to move and market their illicit goods, from narcotics to counterfeit products. So they need all the same logistical expertise as any other business, from trucks to market stalls. And that means having access to, influence over or even control over firms in the industry. The traditional image of drugs, such as cocaine or heroin, is of a product imported in small batches. However, both Scottish and international crime groups increasingly produce drugs such as cannabis or so-called \u8220\'20\'1Clegal highs\u8221\'20\'1D in Scotland. And that involves substantial movements of equipment and raw materials on an industrial scale.\par \par \uc2 SECURITY\par \par \uc2 Security is probably the industry most associated with organised criminals and the one subject to the most attention from law enforcement, with police intelligence now routinely shared with the \uc2 Security Industry Authority\uc2 , the sector\u8217\'20\'19s watchdog. Security is a classic cover for protection rackets but it also offers an opportunity for crime groups to legitimately employ their own muscle. Curiously, even a hint of an organised crime connection can improve the prospects of a security firm, since a \u8220\'20\'1Chard man\u8221\'20\'1D image is a market advantage. The signs put up by criminal security firms are also a potent symbol of turf control.\par \par \uc2 PRIVATE LETTING AND PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT\par \par \uc2 The property boom of the 2000s wasn\u8217\'20\'19t just felt by legitimate investors. Organised crime and its front companies and individuals have huge money in bricks and mortar. Property offers substantial opportunities for laundering money, not least through basic valuation frauds that create fake profits that can be used to explain income earned from illicit activities, especially when prices are rising. Private letting also provides substantial income and power for organised crime groups, helping to control clients and communities.\par \par \uc2 NAIL BARS, HAIRDRESSERS AND TANNING SALONS\par \par \uc2 Beauty businesses \u8211\'20\'13 rich in cash with no-one checking how many clients they really have \u8211\'20\'13 are classic fronts for organised crime groups. They also provide useful legitimate sources of income for the \u8220\'20\'1Cwags\u8221\'20\'1D (wives and girlfriends) of gangsters \u8211\'20\'13 and are handy covers for the movement of drugs and the bulk chemicals and products needed to adulterate them for street resale. Local hairdressers, meanwhile, can also cement organised crime groups into communities \u8232\'20\'28in the same way as pubs, taxi firms or security agencies.\par \par \uc2 CHILDREN\u8217\'20\'19S DAY CARE\par \par \uc2 Childcare may not seem the most obvious front for organised crime, but in fact it offers substantial opportunities for innocent-looking money-laundering as well as being a lucrative business in its own right, especially for unscrupulous entrepreneurs willing to ignore minimum wage and other restrictions. There have been cases of nurseries that have \u8220\'20\'1Cghost\u8221\'20\'1D children \u8211\'20\'13 clients that simply don\u8217\'20\'19t exist but pay hundreds of pounds in cash every week, at least according to their books.\par \par \uc2 CONSUMER CREDIT\par \par \uc2 Organised criminals have long been heavily involved in illegal loan sharking. According to the most recent police intelligence, in recent years they have also tapped into the booming business for payday loans. As The Herald revealed this week, such companies can often afford to offer more reasonable interest rates than their competitors. Why? Because the implicit threat of violence means they are more likely to collect \u8232\'20\'28their debts.\par \par \uc2 THE SCALE\par \par \uc2 ORGANISED crime has long had its specialists, its chemists and accountants, its lawyers and PR men. But it also has access to those who know how to take over rivals, its mergers and acquisition experts.\par \par \uc2 John Cuddihy, of Police Scotland, explained: \u8220\'20\'1CSome of the more sophisticated groups, those that operate at the higher end of criminality, have professional facilitators. They will know how to carry out a takeover, sometimes a hostile takeover, sometimes done by two groups coming together because there is mutual benefit.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Scottish Government estimates the cost to Scotland of organised crime at about \u163\'00\'A32 billion a year. The sheer scale of illicit business suggests gangs have access to considerable capital to take over smaller firms \u8211\'20\'13 or bribe \u8232\'20\'28or bully their way into access to larger ones.\par \par \uc2 The Scottish Business Resilience Centre, funded by police, government and private contributions, has experts too \u8211\'20\'13 those who can advise firms on how to protect themselves.\par \par \uc2 Assistant director Brian Gibson, a police officer seconded to the unit, said: \u8220\'20\'1CBusiness in Scotland is wide and varied but it is all at risk of criminal attack. For small and medium enterprises there is a real risk that a whole company could be attacked by a serious and organised crime gang. But even with your big mainstream companies there is the risk of somebody internal working against them, damaging them reputationally and financially.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For advice, see {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.sbcc.org.uk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 www.sbcc.org.uk}}}\par \par \uc2 Document SUNDHE0020140427ea4r0002c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Cameron defies his Eurosceptics UKIP in text message blitz\par \par \uc2 DAVID CAMERON\uc2  will refuse to make any further concessions to Eurosceptics despite UKIP surging into its first lead in the polls this weekend.\par \par \uc2 The prime minister was struggling to contain a growing Eurosceptic tide last night as he faced calls from Conservative MPs and the public to take a tougher line with Brussels to counter the UKIP threat.\par \par \uc2 Senior Tory backbenchers disclosed that they would visit Downing Street after the vote on May 22 to demand that Cameron outline much more extensive plans for the repatriation of powers from Brussels.\par \par \uc2 But Cameron will put himself on collision course with his party after privately dismissing their concerns and vowing not to give an inch \u8212\'20\'14 even if the Tories are humiliated in the European elections. Tory jitters will be stoked by today's YouGov poll for The Sunday Times on the EU elections, which puts UKIP in the lead for the first time, with the Conservatives trailing a distant third.\par \par \uc2 Despite a week of controversy, Nigel Farage's party has risen to 31%, three points clear of Labour, with the Tories languishing on a lacklustre 19 points.\par \par \uc2 In another blow to the prime minister, the former Tory donor now backing UKIP has indicated he will bankroll the party at the next general election \u8212\'20\'14 boosting Farage's chances of winning seats at Westminster for the first time.\par \par \uc2 Paul Sykes, who is worth \u163\'00\'A3650m, according to next month's Sunday Times Rich List and is among the 200 wealthiest people in Britain, also revealed that he had funded "at least another two waves" of UKIP adverts before the European elections.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not giving up," he said. "That will warn the Conservatives what's going to happen. We will get more democracy in Britain if it skints [sic] me."\par \par \uc2 The prime minister, in a newspaper article last month, detailed the powers he wanted to reclaim from Brussels before his proposed in/out referendum in 2017.\par \par \uc2 They included demands to stop "mass migrations" when new countries join the EU, curbs on benefits for EU migrants and "red card" powers for national parliaments to join together to block future EU laws.\par \par \uc2 But senior backbenchers on the Eurosceptic right, such as Bernard Jenkin, Gerald Howarth, John Redwood and Bill Cash, are all preparing to tell the prime minister that he must address the issue of border controls for existing EU migrants, the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 's attempts to impose the Charter of Fundamental Rights on Britain and the need for national vetoes of existing European laws.\par \par \uc2 Howarth, a former defence minister, said: "It's very important that the prime minister comes out with a specific programme on Europe. Everything we touch, we find that Europe wants to influence or, worse, control us."\par \par \uc2 Another senior backbencher said: "Cameron needs to flesh out in greater detail what the deal is going to be ... He doesn't talk about Continued on page 2 ?? WW ?? Continued from page 1 changing freedom of movement, which is a red line for most of us. He has suggested it for new entrants. Why can't we have it now?" But a senior figure in Downing Street has revealed that Cameron will refuse to spell out further red lines on the grounds that an "endless list of demands" will not fit on campaign leaflets.\par \par \uc2 In a move that will enrage many, Cameron has privately stated that he has no intention of placating the Eurosceptics. "Some people will never be satisfied whatever you say," he said.\par \par \uc2 A source familiar with his thinking said: "We won't be saying more about the renegotiation after the elections. He has spelt out where he wants to see changes and that's what we are sticking with."\par \par \uc2 Cameron and William Hague are also under fire from Cash, chairman of the Commons European scrutiny committee, who is demanding a response from ministers to proposals by the panel for national parliaments to gain "red card" veto powers of EU laws. The \uc2 Foreign &Commonwealth Office\uc2  has yet to formally respond to the proposals as it is required to do.\par \par \uc2 Conservative MPs also want more action to defend the City after the Treasury lost a court case against an EU directive on short selling that could drive hedge funds away from Britain.\par \par \uc2 The new poll shows that it is the MPs not the prime minister who have public support: 42% of voters do not think his plans for renegotiation go far enough, against 25% who say they are about right. A total of 56% of voters think curbing \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  should be the top priority for Cameron's deal with Brussels \u8212\'20\'14 a view that Farage has exploited.\par \par \uc2 While Cameron has dismissed UKIP as "fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists", the poll suggests the party has now broken through as a significant political force with a sizeable chunk of the electorate: 57% of all voters regard them as a protest party, 71% of UKIP's own supporters regard them as a serious party.\par \par \uc2 Sykes told The Sunday Times that if Cameron did not grant a referendum in this parliament "to give the people a say on Brussels and our relationship with it" then he would help fund UKIP candidates at the general election. "If we get a really good result in Europe and it looks promising ... we can put some pressure on by fielding candidates, rolling our sleeves up and putting a professional campaign on. They will certainly win some seats." Sykes indicated that UKIP would be sending text messages to all voters next month as part of his spending blitz. "Technology kicks off in about a week's time," he said. "That will go out to all mobile phones. You've not seen anything like this!" He warned Cameron that "the result of the European elections is going to be a challenge to his leadership". UKIP could profit from further Tory troubles this week because the disgraced MP Patrick Mercer is set to quit and force a by-election over a cash for questions scandal.\par \par \uc2 The Commons standards committee will meet on Tuesday to ban him from parliament for six months. The MP for Newark, a winnable seat for UKIP, has told friends that if he is suspended for more than a month he will have to stand down.\par \par \uc2 Tory plotters spare PM the knife \u8212\'20\'14 for now, page 6.

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Foreigners work at flats owned by backer of UKIP's 'racist' posters\b0\par\par\uc2 Dipesh Gadher; Tim Shipman; Paul Stokes   \par \uc2 811 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 1; National\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 THE millionaire businessman who is bankrolling UKIP's controversial poster campaign targeting \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is the owner of a luxury apartment complex that employs Polish, Lithuanian and Portuguese workers.\par \par \uc2 Four out of 10 staff observed last week at the Residence 6 serviced apartments in Leeds city centre were foreign nationals.\par \par \uc2 The accommodation belongs to Paul Sykes, a property tycoon who recently joined Nigel Farage, UKIP's leader, to launch a series of anti-EU posters ahead of the European elections in May.\par \par \uc2 Opposition politicians branded the language and imagery as divisive and racist. The posters include an image of a giant finger pointing outwards beside the slogan: "26 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?" Another poster portrays a builder begging on the street after apparently being laid off. It states: "EU policy at work. British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour."\par \par \uc2 The campaign is being paid for by Sykes, 70, at a cost of \u163\'00\'A31.5m. The fact that foreign staff are employed at one of his own businesses could leave him open to charges of hypocrisy.\par \par \uc2 Sykes owns Residence 6, which comprises 23 guest apartments in the historic Old Post Office building in Leeds, through a company called Highstone Group. It had assets in 2013 worth \u163\'00\'A3254m according to accounts filed at Companies House.\par \par \uc2 Promotional material for the grade II listed complex says the flats are aimed at "the discerning business or leisure traveller", with features including hand-built kitchens, plasma televisions and a concierge service.\par \par \uc2 Guests trying to find a room at Residence 6 on the Booking.com website are told that staff speak Portuguese, Polish, Lithuanian and English. Just over a third of the employees seen on duty last week by The Sunday Times were from abroad.\par \par \uc2 Staff on the reception desk included a woman in her twenties from Lithuania and a woman from Poland who said she was unlikely to return to her home country after living in Britain for the past nine years.\par \par \uc2 Both are thought to have been employed at the complex for at least three years. Their manager, who is in charge of the concierge service, was said to be Portuguese.\par \par \uc2 One of the housekeeping staff, a man in his mid-thirties, was from Goa, a former Portuguese enclave in India. He said he had worked at Residence 6 when it first opened before he returned to the subcontinent.\par \par \uc2 He said he he had come back to Britain recently on a Portuguese passport and started work again at the apartments a month ago. The man said he missed his young family, but could earn more in the UK than in Goa.\par \par \uc2 Six other workers, including the property's general manager, appeared to be British.\par \par \uc2 The allure of the apartments \u8212\'20\'14 which boast \uc2 Molton Brown\uc2  toiletries \u8212\'20\'14 and the professionalism of its staff are reflected in guest reviews online. One said: "Excellent service from the staff, especially the girl on reception who was so helpful." Another wrote: "It was perfect, the hotel was spotless and the management and staff couldn't do enough for us."\par \par \uc2 When UKIP unveiled its poster campaign last week, Mike Gapes, a Labour MP, said he hoped the "racist" material would encourage "decent" people to vote for another party next month.\par \par \uc2 Farage has claimed that the posters are "a hard-hitting reflection of reality" and only the "chattering classes" would object.\par \par \uc2 Embarrassingly for UKIP, the "British builder" featured in the begging poster has been revealed as an Irish actor.\par \par \uc2 Last night it emerged that UKIP council candidates had made a string of offensive comments on social media, including one who suggested that Lenny Henry, who recently complained about a lack of diversity on television, "should emigrate to a black country".\par \par \uc2 This weekend Sykes said he was unaware that foreigners were working at Residence 6 until alerted to the fact by The Sunday Times, because it is run by a managing agent. "I didn't even know I did benefit [from such staff]," he said.\par \par \uc2 Sykes, who started his working life as a tyre-fitter before amassing a \u163\'00\'A3 650m fortune, said he did not know how much the staff were being paid, but denied they had been hired because they were cheaper than British workers. "We would never undercut the minimum wage," he said.\par \par \uc2 "I'm certainly not removing them. If they are good workers, if they are doing the job right, they deserve the job."\par \par \uc2 Sykes said UKIP wanted "controlled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 " based on skills shortages rather than a complete stop to all labour movement across the EU. He warned that in Yorkshire "these people are just pouring in for reasons only they know and this unlimited \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is going to end in catastrophe".\par \par \uc2 @dipeshgadher\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140427ea4r000oq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The 'robot' husband and his controller are on the stump for UKIP and despite being haunted by past accusations of sleaze, he dreams of being chancellorNEWS REVIEW INTERVIEW\par \par \uc2 Iknow what you're thinking: oh no, not them; the dreadful Hamiltons! Mr Sleaze and Mrs Battleaxe. Cash for questions (him) and cash to appear on tacky celebrity shows (her).\par \par \uc2 Well, knocking the Hamiltons is too easy and too out of date. Today, I meet the new Neil and Christine, who in their own words are "squeaky clean" and very suspicious of the press. The reason I am here is because Neil is now deputy chairman of UKIP \u8212\'20\'14 and Christine is the chairwoman of Neil. "I'm a robot under her control," he cries.\par \par \uc2 This matters because with the European elections next month and UKIP on track to do alarmingly well, the Hamiltons are back; if not at the centre of British political life, then a bit close for comfort.\par \par \uc2 These days they are constantly on the campaign trail, crisscrossing the country and giving speeches. We meet in a room dominated by pinkish leather chairs, a zebra-striped rug and Christine, who keeps interjecting: "Don't go there, darling!" and, "Watch out for that headline!"\par \par \uc2 I suspect the new caution is due to a series of recent controversies that have come UKIP's way. There was last week's furore over its campaign posters \u8212\'20\'14 with their suggestion that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  were after British jobs \u8212\'20\'14 that provoked the usual accusations of "racism".\par \par \uc2 "It was nothing of the sort," spits Neil. "It simply gives the reality of a situation politicians don't want to talk about."\par \par \uc2 What about the builder who appeared in the party's TV election broadcast who had his membership suspended last week after inflammatory racist posts on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 ? Or the matter of the UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, employing his German-born wife as his secretary when UKIP's key message is that those pesky European \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are after your jobs. The stench of hypocrisy is heavy in the air \u8212\'20\'14 but not in this house in south London. "No one could do a 24/7 job like that as well as Kirsten. It would be impractical to have anyone else," Neil says in defence of Mrs Farage.\par \par \uc2 Still, it is a damning picture, particularly since UKIP's central appeal is that it, unlike that bunch in Westminster, is not sleazy or out of touch. Could it be that Farage and his party are just like the rest? "That's what the media want you to think about Farage. That's what all these attacks are about," says Christine. Ah; the old it is the media-wot-dunnit line of defence. Some things never change.\par \par \uc2 It is not easy for Neil Hamilton to defend his party from associations with sleaze. In 1997 he lost one of the safest Conservative seats, Tatton in Cheshire, after allegations that he accepted cash from Mohamed al-Fayed, the owner of \uc2 Harrods\uc2 , for asking parliamentary questions. He was trounced by the former BBC reporter Martin Bell, who stood as an "anti-sleaze" candidate.\par \par \uc2 Reports last week claimed Hamilton had been sacked as head of UKIP strategy because his past would compromise his ability to defend the party. "Complete nonsense," Neil says. "There was no demotion. I was only set to do that job for five months. It was always intended that I should go out on the road in the period up to the election, which I'm now doing."\par \par \uc2 That damn "cash for questions" issue still lingers around Hamilton's name; the sleaze stain that will not wash out. When I ask if he is still haunted by it, he does not flinch. "Normal people never mention it, it's only journalists who do. And it's just not true! I have been vindicated by the Inland Revenue. They scrutinised my financial affairs over a period of 10 years and they concluded there had never been cash for questions." Christine pipes up, "And we got a refund!"\par \par \uc2 So much of the Hamiltons' public life has been dogged and dominated by controversy. In 1984 the BBC's Panorama programme claimed that Neil was part of a gang of right-wing extremists who had infiltrated the Tory party and that Neil had been caught giving a Nazi salute. He successfully sued the BBC.\par \par \uc2 As we talk, Max Clifford is in court, charged with various sexual assaults. "We're the only people to have sued Max Clifford successfully," Christine says proudly. In 2001 Clifford was the go-between for a woman who falsely accused the Hamiltons of rape in a story in the News of the World.\par \par \uc2 I ask Neil why these things keep happening to him. "How do we explain human existence at all? Some people are born lucky, some aren't," he says feebly.\par \par \uc2 Yet still he clings onto public life. You do not have to be Dr Freud to wonder whether this man has a death wish. Even Christine admits that his sense of humour is always getting him into trouble.\par \par \uc2 What never gets mentioned in the Neil Hamilton story is what makes this man tick: he is first and foremost a conviction politician. For 50 years Hamilton has been campaigning against Britain's involvement with Europe. As a schoolboy of 15 \u8212\'20\'14 he was the only Tory in a small Welsh mining village \u8212\'20\'14 Neil joined the Anti-Common Market League. His other great cause is the belief in free markets, something he was advocating long before Margaret Thatcher. I suspect this is why when I ask him if UKIP came to power what position in government he would most like to have, he says: "Chancellor of the exchequer." An ambition which, I suspect, is unlikely to worry \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And that is why instead of returning to the Tories, in 2011 he joined UKIP. The story goes that in 2004 Neil and Christine were wooed over a boozy lunch by Farage, who asked both of them to stand as MEPs in forthcoming elections. Neil, who was bankrupt at the time, did not want to go back into politics until he got his finances sorted out. So why had Christine turned UKIP down? "I couldn't stand the idea of running for anything. I hate the confrontational nature of politics."\par \par \uc2 But why UKIP? Hamilton says the Tories will never leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and their promise of a referendum is one big "fraud". He is full of paranoia: "Cameron is lying to the electorate over Europe. His referendum will not be free and fair, it will be rigged."\par \par \uc2 Even Cameron's Christianity is under attack. "He has no serious religious conviction whatsoever. He's just saying what headlines require."\par \par \uc2 How does he know that? "I know," he says unconvincingly. As for his former party, the 65-year-old Hamilton says with a wry smile: "I can remember the days when it was full of Eton schoolboys."\par \par \uc2 UKIP's success, Neil says, is because "so many issues are off the agenda because British politicians can't do anything about them; like \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 we don't control our own borders. The environment is another issue. All those windmills going up and consequently millions are in fuel poverty. The widow who struggles to pay her electricity bill is having such a struggle because she puts money into rich landowners' pockets like Cameron's father-in-law Sir Reginald Sheffield, who gets \u163\'00\'A31,000 a day for windmills on his land! This is what outrages me!" Christine believes that the political class has simply "lost touch with ordinary people".\par \par \uc2 Neil chips in: "[People] can see we're not a party consumed by spin and manipulation."\par \par \uc2 If only that were so. UKIP's pretence that it is the party that speaks its mind is rubbish. For example, Neil is happy to tell you he is a libertarian. But ask what this means in practice \u8212\'20\'14 that is, does he believe the individual should be free to choose to take drugs and consume porn \u8212\'20\'14 and he says he does not "want to go there", fearing bad headlines.\par \par \uc2 And when I ask him whether UKIP is a party of the right, Neil says: "These are meaningless and unhelpful terms. UKIP is neither a party of the right or left."\par \par \uc2 This is intellectually disingenuous; a classic politician's cop-out. And when you listen to them discussing UKIP policy it all sounds so reasonable, so sensible, that you forget that they are a populist party of the right. The couple's talent for spin is right out of the Lord Mandelson school.\par \par \uc2 I try to point out to Neil that you cannot have it both ways \u8212\'20\'14 you cannot say we are the party of politically incorrect mavericks unafraid to go off-message and speak our minds \u8212\'20\'14 and then say, oh, by the way, I don't want to talk about that. But the Hamiltons will not budge.\par \par \uc2 As the interview progresses, bits of the old off-message and indiscreet Hamiltons pop out. They have been together for 45 years \u8212\'20\'14 and married for 35. They met at a student conference in Yorkshire. "I looked across the room and he was so good-looking in those days with his Byronic sideburns."\par \par \uc2 "They were torn off in a moment of passion," says Neil.\par \par \uc2 Christine tuts and rolls her eyes.\par \par \uc2 When she says he was studying for a degree, he says: "It wasn't my brain she was interested in!" "Oh, darling, for goodness' sake!" cries Christine.\par \par \uc2 They are something of a comic double act. She plays the bossy battleaxe to his hen-pecked husband. Their years together have had some bad bumps but life with the Hamiltons has never been boring.\par \par \uc2 UKIP boogie\par \par \uc2 Cabaret\par \par \uc2 Liza Minnelli\par \par \uc2 The Laughing Policeman\par \par \uc2 Charles Penrose\par \par \uc2 Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\par \par \uc2 Eartha Kitt What a Wonderful World\par \par \uc2 Louis Armstrong\par \par \uc2 La Vie en Rose\par \par \uc2 Edith Piaf Listen to Neil and Christine Hamilton's exclusive Sunday Times playlist at spoti.fi/thehamiltons.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 As collectors and experts are convulsed by a huge forgery scandal, Tony Allen-Mills explains how they came to be duped by the works of a Chinese street artist\par \par \uc2 It began on a Greenwich Village street corner, where a struggling Chinese \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  artist named Pei-Shen Qian churned out swiftly drawn portraits of passers-by for barely enough money to pay his rent.\par \par \uc2 Everything changed when a charming Spaniard who called himself Carlos stopped to watch Qian at work at his easel on West 4th Street, and one of the most improbable scandals in New York art history was born.\par \par \uc2 The arrest in Spain 10 days ago of Jose Carlos Berganti\u241\'00\'F1os Diaz \u8212\'20\'14 the man Qian knew as Carlos \u8212\'20\'14 has added what may prove a final chapter to an $80m art forgery in which imitations of the works of Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning sold for up to $17m a canvas. According to New York prosecutors, Berganti\u241\'00\'F1os masterminded the fraudulent "ageing" process that turned the Chinese artist's work into convincing period forgeries. He is alleged to have personally netted $33m from a scheme he ran with his brother, Jesus Angel, and his Mexican former girlfriend, Glafira Rosales.\par \par \uc2 Qian, 75, fled back to China months ago. When questioned by reporters, who had tracked him down, he insisted that he had no idea his works were being passed off as masterpieces. He told Bloomberg Businessweek that he had been paid only a few thousand dollars for paintings he was told would be sold to art lovers who could not afford the real thing.\par \par \uc2 "The \uc2 FBI\uc2  said [my paintings] were done by the hands of a genius," he said. "Well, that's me.\par \par \uc2 How strange it feels!" According to US authorities, it was Berganti\u241\'00\'F1os who urged Qian to copy the styles of famous painters. Court documents show that the artist was paid between $5,000 and $9,000 a canvas for works he created using old materials scavenged from flea markets.\par \par \uc2 Berganti\u241\'00\'F1os would sometimes used tea-stained canvases to give the appearance of age, and further doctored the paintings by leaving them outdoors or heating them with a hair dryer. With his brother and Rosales he would then concoct elaborate stories to explain the provenance of previously unknown works that appeared in no official catalogue.\par \par \uc2 The scam took off when Rosales met \uc2 Ann Freedman\uc2 , then president of Knoedler &Company, a renowned New York art dealer that had been in business since 1846.\par \par \uc2 For the next decade and a half, Rosales supplied Knoedler and another New York dealer with at least 60 of Qian's works.\par \par \uc2 Freedman has since claimed she had no idea that the paintings she sold were fake, and that all of them passed muster with the experts who viewed them.\par \par \uc2 The bubble burst in November 2011, when Knoedler went out of business, and a swarm of lawsuits followed as the full extent of the forgery scam became clear. The first alarm was sounded by \uc2 Pierre Lagrange\uc2 , a London-based hedge fund investor who had paid $17m to Knoedler for a canvas attributed to Pollock.\par \par \uc2 Lagrange submitted the painting to forensic testers, who discovered what Knoedler's experts had missed: one yellow pigment used in the paint had not become commercially available until years after Pollock's death in 1956.\par \par \uc2 Freedman insisted to New York magazine that she had gone to great lengths to \uc2 seek\uc2  corroborating opinions from art experts before she put the paintings supplied by Rosales on sale. Yet all her experts were fooled by an ageing artist who professed astonishment last year that anyone could have regarded his fakes as real.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody would take [my imitations] seriously," Qian told Bloomberg. "It's impossible to imitate [the real masterpieces] \u8212\'20\'14 from the papers to the paints to the composition. It's impossible to do it exactly."\par \par \uc2 Among the victims of the scam were several prominent collectors who are now suing Knoedler for their money back. They include John Howard, a financier who paid $4m for a fake de Kooning, and \uc2 Frank Fertitta III\uc2 , a billionaire Las Vegas casino owner who claims to have paid Knoedler $7.2m for a knock-off Rothko.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Qian is believed to be living quietly in his native Shanghai, with little to show for his artistic skills. He may yet face charges in America, but not everyone in the New York art market would like to see him locked up.\par \par \uc2 "While forgery is very clearly an economic crime, it may not always be an artistic or aesthetic one," noted Blake Gopnik, an art critic and the author of a forthcoming biography of Andy Warhol. "If a fake is good enough to fool experts, then it's good enough to give the rest of us pleasure."\par \par \uc2 @taminusa\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140427ea4r000my\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

The business delivered sales of almost \u163\'00\'A318m in the 12 months to March last year, the most recent period for which accounts are publicly available.\par \par \uc2 The brothers are descendants of David Gestetner, a Hungarian \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  who built up an eponymous copying machine business.\par \par \uc2 As well as swimwear, Daniel's business interests include a newly launched diner being run in partnership with \uc2 Tesco\uc2  and called Fred's Food Construction. It recently opened its first branch in west London.\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140427ea4r000es\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 FANGS A LOT Well done Eithne Shortall for not only bringing Sheridan Le Fanu back to our attention ("Culture vulture", last week) but also for boosting Irish tourism. Every vampire aficionado, Gothic horror fan, para-psychologist, ghost hunter, and the simply curious, will now head to Dublin. After all, who would want to miss the unique spectacle of Fanu's ancestors renovating the family vault? I hope the writer's descendants will be able to cope with all the publicity.\par \par \uc2 Bernd Biege Mount Nugent, Co Cavan SPEECH IMPEDIMENT Does Brenda Power ("Cartoon row shows 'free speech' still comes with a filter", Comment, last week) believe that free speech should extend to shouting "Fire!" in a crowded cinema? Ryan Cronin Macken Place, Dublin 2 BEAUTY TIP Like most men, I find the Style section of your paper superfluous but the cover last week "Can we stop our daughters obsessing about their looks?" amused me. No, you can't, but if you really want to do something about it, dumping the Style's page after page of flawless models, make-up tips and beach bodies would probably be a decent start.\par \par \uc2 Simon O'Neill Clontarf Road, Dublin 3 THE PARTY'S OVER You say "it will take more than a cabinet reshuffle to change the public perception" of Fine Gael ("Scandals put Fine Gael in the voters' sin bin", Editorial, last week). Surely it is the government as a whole which has lost its way. "Married in haste" has given way to "repenting at leisure".\par \par \uc2 One poll has suggested half of those intending to vote in a general election (now likely before 2016) have no confidence in any of the main parties. Even among those intending to vote for those parties, there is acute unease. We may have been naive to have expected a political class which belongs firmly in the 20th century to have made the leap into 21-century realities. Maurice O'Connell Tralee, Co Kerry POPE WITHOUT FRONTIERS \uc2 Pope Francis\uc2 's social-policy adviser Margaret Archer wants trafficked women to be allowed to get residency and citizenship in the West because, she says, "They did not come here voluntarily; they are not illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 " ("Woman takes lead in Pope's crusade", News, last week). However, almost all have been smuggled, albeit with the promise or hope of decent work. Of course they must be rescued from the abuse they find themselves in, but then deported. The problem with \uc2 Pope Francis\uc2  and his views on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is that, by his own admission, he cares nothing for national borders. He has described himself as "the pastor of a church without frontiers". He should not be listened to on the subject of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . \u193\'00\'C1ine N\u237\'00\'ED Chonaill \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Control Platform, Dublin 2 GUITAR GRATES On his piece on Bernard Butler last week ("A new string to his axe", Culture) Dan Cairns describes the Fender Stratocaster as "arguably one of the least loved of all guitars". Eh? The list of famous Stratocaster lovers is lengthy, but to name just a few: Buddy Holly, Hank Marvin, Jimi Hendrix, Rory Gallagher, Eric Clapton, David Gilmour, Pete Townshend, Ronnie Wood, Mark Knopfler. The Stratocaster may not have the faux-coolness bestowed on some other guitars by indie acts (Jaguar? Please!), but those of us who have fallen under its spell would beg to differ with Cairns's opinion.\par \par \uc2 Se\u225\'00\'E1n O'Flynn Kilcolgan, Co Galway CLARIFICATION A report ("Palace outgun Cardiff", Sport, April 6) on the match between Cardiff City Football Club and Crystal Palace referred to speculation that Iain Moody, Palace's sporting director and formerly head of recruitment at Cardiff, had been refused entry to the Cardiff directors' box by the club's owner, Vincent Tan. We now understand, and accept, that Mr Moody did not even request entry to the Cardiff directors' box \u8212\'20\'14 he was not banned by Mr Tan. We are happy to clarify the position.\par \par \uc2 Letters should arrive by midday Thursday and include the full address and a daytime and an evening telephone number.

This is the once thriving English market town of Wisbech, Cambs \u8212\'20\'14 now dubbed "Little Lithuania".\par \par \uc2 There are now an estimated 5,000 Lithuanians living among Wisbech's population of 28,000 \u8212\'20\'14 meaning one in six here are from the Baltic state.\par \par \uc2 Many have come looking for work and it is available to them for \u163\'00\'A350 per day. There is even an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  only work camp on the outskirts of the town.\par \par \uc2 Unemployed local engineer Nev Tharby, 44, says the low rates of pay taken by the foreign workers make it hard for people like him to find a job.\par \par \uc2 He said: "Many of the Lithuanian guys will do what I do for half the price that I used to. They take the low-paid jobs leaving our young with nothing to go for apart from the dole."\par \par \uc2 Work is a cause of friction between the \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  community and locals, with tensions rising on the high street too. Around a quarter of shops in the town's Norfolk Street exclusively sell Eastern European items.\par \par \uc2 And one food retailer, who refused to be named, told The Sun on Sunday he will be forced to close his 108-year-old family business this year \u8212\'20\'14 and he blames migrants buying their own food instead of local produce. Lithuania Halina Paskovska, 47, who has been here for five years and works as a care assistant, claims some of her countrymen are not willing to integrate.\par \par \uc2 Rasa Venckute, 27, who came over from Lithuania six years ago and runs a phone shop on Norfolk Street, said: "It is not good here. You rarely hear an English accent, but when you do lots of people are angry here about how many foreigners are here."\par \par \uc2 Last year there were protests over the number of migrants.\par \par \uc2 Poundland worker Ben Tuen, 21, says he is concerned about the safety of his partner Hannah Wright, 19, and one-year-old daughter Daisy and is thinking of moving away. He said: "There are a lot of tensions between the foreign communities and the English. I think it stems from who is taking all the jobs.\par \par \uc2 "It's not safe in the evenings and I don't want my family getting caught in the crossfire of any violence."\par \par \uc2 But resident Dean Reeves, 46, has founded the We Are Wisbech group to try to bring local and \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  communities together.\par \par \uc2 He said: "We've had 5,000 people come, but many are quickly becoming part of the settled community here. In many cases we are on the second or third generation. A lot of their children speak English and support the England football team."\par \par \uc2 Labour town councillor Reg Mee is also looking at the positives. He said: "They have opened up lots of restaurants and shops in the town. Those shops would be empty otherwise and I would rather have an Eastern European shop than no shop at all.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot of people in this town who don't like the number of Lithuanians who have come here, but are they prepared to work in the factories and in the fields?"\par \par \uc2 Among those fields sits the Fridaybridge Farm Camp. It held Italian POWs during World War Two, but today offers \u163\'00\'A336-per week accommodation for migrants, who can earn up to \u163\'00\'A3140-a-day working on the surrounding farms. Vatalia Plilikate, 50, came over in 2010 and has been at the camp since it opened three years ago \u8212\'20\'14 working nightshifts at a farm produce warehouse.\par \par \uc2 She said: "I like it here. I came over thinking I would only work a few months, but the money is good and the rent is cheap and I can make a good living."\par \par \uc2 Workers stay eight-to-a-dorm and enjoy onsite facilities such as free wifi, a swimming pool, gym, tennis courts, football pitch, supermarket, tanning salon \u8212\'20\'14 even a nightclub.\par \par \uc2 Camp boss Wayne Cotterill says there are plans to open similar camps in towns around the country.\par \par \uc2 He added: "We try to give \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  a good life here. A happy worker is a better worker."\par \par \uc2 Around 130,000 Lithuanians now live in the UK compared to 22,000 when they joined the EU in 2004.\par \par \uc2 But Nev Tharby, who has now been out of work for more than two years, remains unconvinced that there is any benefit for people like him.\par \par \uc2 He said: "Wisbech has become Little Lithuania. You can understand why people want to vote Ukip."\par \par \uc2 ben.griffiths@the-sun.co.uk\par \par \uc2 The Sun on Sunday Says \u8212\'20\'14 Page 16\par \par \uc2 'Money is good and rent is cheap'\par \par \uc2 'It's not safe here in the evenings'\par \par \uc2 I'd rather have East European shop than no shop - REG MEE\par \par \uc2 They do what I do for half the price I used to - NEV THARBY\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140427ea4r000be\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Hurling insults at Ukip is not the solution\b0\par\par\uc2 1,178 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 I wonder if those Tory media groupies who are currently attacking Ukip with such hysterical fervour actually think that they are helping. By which I mean, of course, helping their own side: there is no question at all that they are helping Ukip. That they have now been joined in full cry by a team of Labour cheerleaders must have Nigel Farage opening yet another bottle in celebration.\par \par \uc2 Clearly the Clegg-Farage debates were the breaking point. The catastrophic failure of Nick Clegg's attempt to defend the official pro-European case has caused the mainstream parties to give up any prospect of winning the rational argument. So they are now reduced simply to smear and shame by association.\par \par \uc2 This would not matter all that much since, in the short term, Ukip's popularity will be largely unaffected, and in the long term it will cease to matter as an electoral force. But in the course of this campaign of desperate vilification, there is serious damage being done to the public discourse.\par \par \uc2 First, the accusation of "racism" was bandied about in ways that were simply absurd. The contentious Ukip poster that shows a finger pointing at the (presumably British) viewer, and a warning that 26 million EU migrants are looking for work and potentially competing for his job, may be inflammatory and divisive. But to call it racist is to debase the language: it is an insult to those whose lives have been devastated, or ended, by genuine racism. As a member of an ethnic minority that was almost annihilated by an actual racist regime, I find this trivialisation of the concept seriously offensive.\par \par \uc2 In one particularly preposterous broadcast encounter, the interviewer advised Farage that the dictionary definition of racism was the assertion that one race was superior to another - and that because his poster suggested that the British worker was "superior" to the foreign one, it was inherently racist. In fact, if anything, the poster suggested precisely the opposite: that foreign workers are likely to be superior competitors who will put indigenous employees at a natural disadvantage.\par \par \uc2 At any rate, all the mainstream parties now publicly accept that unlimited migration has caused economic and social problems. This admission, and the need to reassert Britain's control over its borders, has become part of David Cameron's official renegotiation strategy with the EU. Why should this be a legitimate concern for the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to raise, but outrageous, and "racist", when it is pointed out by Ukip? The only substantive distinction between the Conservatives' stance and Ukip's on the mass-migration question is that Farage's party believes it will be impossible to negotiate away the EU open-borders policy.\par \par \uc2 After the poster farrago had died down - having had no effect whatever on Ukip's standing in the polls - there came a rather more serious incident with an activist who actually had published a stream of racist tweets. Farage promptly suspended Andre Lampitt from the party, thereby exhausting the possibilities of further shock and disgust. Interestingly, he refused to do the same to the next embarrassment the media dredged up, Exeter branch chairman David Challice, whose offence was to appear in a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  video expressing the sort of criticisms of multiculturalism and moral relativism that can be read in almost any Right-of-centre publication. With considerable tactical astuteness, Farage stated that the right to present controversial or unfashionable opinions was one that his party stood by - thereby drawing a distinction between Challice's views and the true racism of Lampitt, whom he had banished.\par \par \uc2 As it happens, I disagree with Ukip's position on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . I have mentioned before on this page that I am an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  twice over. My grandparents fled to the New World to escape from the pogroms waged by a genuinely racist regime, and I emigrated, under more leisurely circumstances, to Britain and adopted it as my home.\par \par \uc2 Having grown up in a nation in which everybody (or their antecedents) came from somewhere else, I do not personally have any difficulty accepting the cosmopolitan nature of the London neighbourhood where I live. I believe firmly that human progress is the story of the movement of peoples, and that economic migration is a particular force for good, offering as it does the possibility of personal liberation and self-improvement.\par \par \uc2 But none of that is to say that I do not understand the fears and resentments of people whose lives have been less privileged than mine: who have not had the education and the life chances that make for an easy enjoyment of cultural variety and little worry about competition for scarce employment.\par \par \uc2 My in-laws in the North of England - who are not racists either - live in a different world, in which skilled men in the building trades are competing with Eastern Europeans who will work for wages that could not support a British household. It is quite wicked to pretend that anyone whose life is affected by these pressures must be a bigot for complaining - or even for supporting the one party that seems to speak frankly on their behalf.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the argument moves on. The most fashionable thing to say at the moment is that smearing Ukip obviously doesn't work, so let's open another front. As well as telling people that they should be ashamed of themselves for supporting a "racist" party, we should explain why mass migration is good for the country. Don't just throw insults: make the positive case.\par \par \uc2 Which, of course, is just another way of telling all those people who are flocking to Ukip that their perception of reality is deluded. They are not actually disadvantaged by competition from cheaper labour. Their children are not actually going to schools where only a minority of pupils speak English. Whatever they think they are seeing with their own eyes, there is no price to be paid for uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Let's watch and see how that goes down.\par \par \uc2 The best way to counter an opponent who is distasteful but wildly popular is not to scream abuse at him, or imply that his followers are morons who do not understand their own circumstances. There is another way altogether to defeat what you see as dangerous populism: address the need that it is filling.\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives undermined the electoral attraction of the BNP in the Eighties by making it clear to the country that they understood its anxiety about Commonwealth \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and by taking steps to limit it. Offered a respectable mainstream alternative, the British voter will turn away from the extreme option. But now, alas, because we are subject to EU rule, there is no longer the possibility of a simple governmental decision to reduce the number of migrants. So we have mainstream party leaders powerless to respond to the popular will. Which is where we - and Ukip - came in.\par \par \uc2 You can defeat dangerous populism by addressing the need that it is fulfilling\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140427ea4r0003i\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Louise Mensch\par \b \uc2 Clown prince Nigel to blame for Ukip falling on its face\b0\par\par\uc2 By LOUISE MENSCH, Sun Columnist   \par \uc2 1,394 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2014\par 04:03\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd.

Will anyone have the guts to mount a challenge?\par \par \uc2 If my friend Dan Hannan MEP, our most Eurosceptic Tory, were to defect, he\u8217\'20\'19d be a brilliant Ukip leader \u8212\'20\'14 and someone the Tories could do business with.\par \par \uc2 Obesity's the real growing problem POOR Charity Pierce. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/5591378/54st-mum-bids-to-slim-and-wed-her-20-year-old-toyboy.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 The star of yesterday’s Sun front page}}}\uc2  is the fattest woman in the world \u8211\'20\'13 and it\u8217\'20\'19s no surprise she\u8217\'20\'19s from America.\par \par \uc2 The Yanks laugh at the state of Brits\u8217\'20\'19 teeth \u8211\'20\'13 and we think of them as fat slobs.\par \par \uc2 The trouble with this lazy stereotype is Britain is getting fatter too \u8211\'20\'13 at an ALARMING rate.

\par\par \uc2 Observer Home News Pages\par \b \uc2 Children 'kept from parents at asylum centre': Charity says separation of families is being used at an \uc2 immigration\uc2  facility as a means of control\b0\par\par\uc2 by Jamie Doward   \par \uc2 648 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Children of refused asylum seekers held at a specialist removal centre are being separated from their parents as a form of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  control, according to the charity that looks after their welfare.\par \par \uc2 Barnardo's, which has helped run Cedars, a purpose-built centre near Gatwick, since it opened in 2011, says the children should be separated from their parents only if there are welfare concerns. The centre accommodates families in their last 72 hours in Britain before their flight out.\par \par \uc2 Barnardo's deputy director of strategy, Alison Worsley, said almost one in six families ended up being separated at some point, often before or after they were held at Cedars. "Some for very legitimate reasons," Worsley said. "For example, if a parent is a danger to their child."\par \par \uc2 But in its new report, Cedars Two Years On, Barnardo's claims some family splits "are often a plan or contingency in response to actual or potentially" non-compliant behaviour. The report states: "As a child welfare organisation this concerns us, as we do not think a family split should be used for the purposes of effecting \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  enforcement."\par \par \uc2 Currently most family separations are authorised by an assistant director in the Home Office and are usually overseen by an independent panel. Guidance stipulates that splits should be used for the shortest possible time, and the family informed about the separation and of plans for their reunification.\par \par \uc2 However, the report quotes examples where one of the parents is separated from their children for several days and often returned on different flights. "Barnardo's believes that, if the government continues to use family splits as a means of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  enforcement, these should be authorised at a more senior level to ensure compliance with existing guidance."\par \par \uc2 Cedars was opened in response to concerns about the detention of children of asylum seekers in Yarl's Wood. As a result of changes introduced by the coalition, championed by Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and which drew support from the actor Colin Firth, the amount of time families now spend in pre-departure accommodation is normally limited to 72 hours. The number of children held prior to removal has reduced significantly - from 1,120 children in Yarl's Wood in 2009 to just 90 in Cedars in 2012.\par \par \uc2 But Barnardo's says that, despite significant progress, more needs to be done to protect vulnerable children and their families. It is calling for improvements to the arrest and escorting arrangements for families to Cedars and Gatwick. There are examples of large teams of police dressed in protective armour arriving at the door of a refused asylum seeker and their family, a potentially intimidating process.\par \par \uc2 "Barnardo's recommends that arresting officers should only wear personal protective clothing where risk assessments indicate that this is necessary to protect themselves or others," the report notes. "Where possible, officers should not wear uniform, and should transport families in unmarked vehicles."\par \par \uc2 The report reveals that in April 2012 Barnardo's highlighted the use of disproportionate force on an adult en route from Cedars that resulted in a Home Office investigation. The report notes that, since then, Barnardo's has expressed concerns about the force used on two other adults and both cases have been the subject of Professional Standards Unit investigations.\par \par \uc2 A Home Office spokesman said that it had "dramatically reformed the process to ensure that the welfare of the child is at the heart" of the family returns process. "The independent family returns panel are consulted prior to every ensured return, and families are only ever removed separately where it is in the best interests of all involved."\par \par \uc2 Cedars, near Gatwick, accommodates families in their last 72 hours in Britain.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140426ea4r00037\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ukip is facing a fresh storm of controversy as further evidence emerged of racism among its local election candidates, including a suggestion by one that the comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a "black country".\par \par \uc2 Candidates have taken to social media sites to rail against Islam as "organised crime under religious camouflage" while likening the religion to Nazism, and suggesting that the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence has received a disproportionate level of attention.\par \par \uc2 One candidate for election in Enfield, William Henwood, responded to a recent speech by Henry, in which he suggested there was a poor representation of black and ethnic minorities on British television, by tweeting: "He should emigrate to a black country. He does not have to live with whites."\par \par \uc2 Ukip, polling at 18% in the latest Observer/Opinium findings, said last night the party was "non-racist, non-sectarian" and that "any comments made by members that fail to uphold these values will be duly investigated and acted upon".\par \par \uc2 The latest developments will only add to Nigel Farage's woes after a disastrous week for the party in which its big advertising campaign has been picked apart. Ukip has already been forced to suspend the "poster boy" of its European party election broadcast after it was revealed he had posted a series of racist comments on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . A builder in a Ukip poster accusing EU workers of taking UK jobs was discovered to be an Irish actor who migrated to this country, and a woman who appeared on a poster as a voter from Devon was Ukip's events manager and an assistant to the party leader.\par \par \uc2 Ukip has attempted to improve its vetting of candidates in the local and European elections to be held next month, but it appears that some of their members will not be constrained on social media. Along with his comments about Henry, the party's candidate in Enfield Town, London, has tweeted that "Islam reminds me of the 3rd Reich, strength through violence against the citizens". He said Muslims "like us to fawn to them" and "young Muslim men remind me of young Afrikaners. They are taught at an early age they have the right to abuse."\par \par \uc2 A Ukip candidate in Camden, Magnus Nielsen, used his \uc2 Facebook\uc2  account to post: "70% of mosques in the UK have been taken over by Wahabbi fundamentalists. Islam is organised crime under religious camouflage. Any Muslim who is not involved in organised crime is not a 'true believer', practising Islam as Muhammad commanded."\par \par \uc2 And, earlier this month, in the wake of allegations of police corruption in the investigation into the murder of Lawrence, Matt Pavey, a Ukip candidate in Lewisham, tweeted: "Does anyone remember the name Jean Bradley murder unsolved in Acton, London, in 1993. Anyone looking for corruption here? No, thought not." Pavey tweeted two days later: "Lets all take a moment to remember Jean Bradley stabbed to death on the streets of London in March 1993 and no justice #stephenlawrence." And again that day he tweeted: "Lets please take a moment to remember Penny Bell stabbed 50 times in London 1991. No justice #stephenlawrence." Pavey said he was not prepared to comment on his tweets but that there was "no malice" intended.\par \par \uc2 Gareth Thomas, the shadow minister for Europe, said the tweets should be seen as evidence that Ukip is "not fit to represent the country in Europe".\par \par \uc2 The Observer has also learned that Ukip MEPs are employing foreign nationals as parliamentary assistants while the party publicly takes a tough public stance against European \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  taking British jobs. Last week Farage was involved in an exchange with the BBC's political editor, \uc2 Nick Robinson\uc2 , over the employment of his German wife as his secretary.\par \par \uc2 Gerard Batten, Ukip MEP for London, has hired foreigners in both his European and UK constituency offices. Pavel Stroilov, from Russia, works in Batten's London office, while a Polish citizen, Kamila Zarychta, is his accredited assistant in Brussels. Batten said: "I employ people on the basis of whether I think they can do the job."\par \par \uc2 Ukip's East Midlands MEP Roger Helmer, who has an Italian assistant, Francesca Salierno, in Brussels, said: "I absolutely reject the assumption that because we're opposed to mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  it is therefore somehow inconsistent and hypocritical for a Ukip MEP to hire a foreign person."\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Lenny Henry 'does not have to live with whites', said Ukip's William Henwood.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140426ea4r00033\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Reviews\par \b \uc2 The Stories by Jane Gardam, book review: These tales unfurl their meanings, like the slow blooming of a miraculous flower\b0\par\par\uc2 Neel Mukherjee   \par \uc2 579 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 April 2014\par 02:07\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The fickle, herd instinct-dominated media world needs constant reminders of greater, more lasting achievements, so it is good to have one such in the form of the selected short stories of Jane Gardam. The volume brings together 30 pieces, culled mostly from six of her seven collections published between 1980 and 2007, and also includes a few she has written for magazines, most famously "Old Filth", the story for The Oldie that became the starting point for her extraordinary trilogy, Old Filth, The Man in the Wooden Hat and Last Friends.\par \par \uc2 It is good, too, to be reminded that Gardam is as brilliant a short story writer as she is a novelist. The two forms are divergent, and mastery of one is in no way a guarantee of command over the other. Gardam, like Penelope Fitzgerald, knows the supreme art of what and exactly how much to leave out: this can be a productive point of entry into thinking about the short-story form. What one gets with the pages of a short story is like a little bit of illuminated ground that sets one thinking of the dark hinterlands lying behind it; absences, truncation, resonances, the invitation to imagine \u8211\'20\'13 these are the short story's techniques and pleasures. In one of the most devastating stories in the collection, "Rode by all with Pride", we are never allowed entry into the mind of a girl who kills herself \u8211\'20\'13 she appears only marginally \u8211\'20\'13 but we learn about it in the first line. The story will not tell you why but instead place you intimately in the world of her parents and leave you to work things out.\par \par \uc2 There are stories here like poetry: they will continue to unfurl their meanings over time, like a slow blooming of a miraculous flower. In "The Pig Boy", Veronica, all at sea amongst the colonial wives in Hong Kong while over on her first visit to her husband, suddenly finds her dislike of an alien city transforming into fascination after an almost dreamlike encounter with an infernally smelly boy transporting pigs. "Swan" ends with a similarly transformative moment when a mute seven-year-old Chinese boy, an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  in London, is found to have a magical empathy with swans. Gardam's reserves of compassion and sympathy for her characters, especially those at the sharp end of power, are seemingly endless. "The Tribute" is like a slap to the collective face of all the snobby colonial wives who treated their nanny as less than a human being; Gardam is all-seeing when it comes to particularly English stripes of discrimination and cruelty.\par \par \uc2 Structure is another fulcrum around which the short story turns, easily overlooked. In "Telegony", a collection of three linked stories, about a transgressive love affair in Victorian times, the suppression of that information, and the shadows it casts on the present, is a masterclass in mosaic design. The slightest touch of magic, sometimes in the form of grace, as in the heartbreaking "Easter Lilies", often brushes against Gardam's work. The whisper of redemptive uplift that she is generous enough to bring to the end of some of her stories is, above all, truthful. This is a deeply, impeccably humane and pleasurable book.\par \par \uc2 Neel Mukherjee's second novel, 'The Lives of Others' (Chatto & Windus), is out next month\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140430ea4q000de\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Event\par \b \uc2 Food queues 3,000 long and thousands of new jobs for women...

A pub called The King of Prussia became The King of Belgium.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 In Sainsbury\u8217\'20\'19s, German sausage was rebranded Luncheon sausage.\par \par \uc2 But for most, there was no hiding place: as the war went on, houses and shops owned by Germans were looted and destroyed.\par \par \uc2 The First Sea Lord, Jackie Fisher, even seriously proposed that a large number of hostages be taken from the German population of London, one of them to be executed for each British civilian killed by a German bomb.\par \par \uc2 With the great theatre of war on the other side of the Channel, London became a sort of backstage area, the corridor through which virtually every British soldier entered, and, if lucky, exited.\par \par \uc2 And it was like being backstage in other ways, too: famously, the noise from the French battlefields could often be heard in London, as, in the words of one resident, \u8216\'20\'18a kind of pulsation in regular beats\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Jerry White, the historian of an acclaimed series of books about London in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, has now turned his attention to the much briefer period of London from 1914-1918.\par \par \uc2 For various reasons \u8211\'20\'13 not least the impact of the Blitz \u8211\'20\'13 London is generally more associated with World War II, but within a few pages White proves his claim that World War I \u8216\'20\'18utterly dominated the city\u8217\'20\'19s life\u8217\'20\'19 and that, even a century on, \u8216\'20\'18Londoners still live with many of the consequences of the First World War\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 A fair number of these consequences, it should be said, have proved positive.\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of thousands of women of all classes were entrusted for the first time with vital work: 25,000 women worked at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, and they proved themselves in various jobs \u8211\'20\'13 railway ticket collectors, tram conductors \u8211\'20\'13 previously reserved for men. Once the war was over, there was no turning back.\par \par \uc2 And by the end of the war, the divide between rich and poor had been weakened.\par \par \uc2 Full employment, increased wages and substantial overtime might not have meant that, as one observer had it, \u8216\'20\'18the rich have become poor, the poor have become rich\u8217\'20\'19, but they certainly narrowed the gap.\par \par \uc2 Jerry White is masterful at mixing hard facts and statistics with telling anecdotes.\par \par \uc2 To illustrate the pre-war class divide, he tells the story of a lady who dined regularly at the Cafe Royal and would always order chicken in browned butter sauce for her Pekinese, which was provided with an expensive cushion and chair.\par \par \uc2 When someone suggested that the remains of the chicken might be given to the poor people who used to come to the back door of the restaurant, she \u8216\'20\'18turned round, and with a look as cold as marble said, \u8220\'20\'1CI hate poor people, they depress me\u8221\'20\'1D\u8201\'20\'09\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Contempt such as this would not disappear, but, after the war, it would never again be so open.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, wages for every type of profession, but particularly servants, radically improved.\par \par \uc2 White is particularly good at showing the peculiar push-me/pull-you relationship between power and people, the rulers and the ruled.\par \par \uc2 Many public figures tried to seize on the outbreak of war as the perfect opportunity to purge the nation of what they saw as the moral squalor of the Edwardian age.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18We are fighting Germany, Austria and Drink,\u8217\'20\'19 announced Lloyd George.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18And as far as I can see, the greatest of these deadly foes is Drink.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Accordingly, pub opening hours were cut from 19\u189\'00\'BD hours a day to just five-and-a-half, and the super-strong beer that was normal before 1914 disappeared from our shelves for ever.\par \par \uc2 And the crackdown worked: the number of arrests for drunk and disorderly behaviour in Greater London in 1914 \u8211\'20\'13 68,000 \u8211\'20\'13 has not been matched since.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, there were some areas in which the finger-waggers made no difference whatsoever.\par \par \uc2 As long ago as 1915, the National Council of Public Morals was linking the rise in juvenile delinquency to violence in films, and demanding tougher censorship.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s strange to think that at the same time as they were calling for an end to screen violence, they were prepared to tolerate the deaths of 20,000 British soldiers\u160\'00\'A0 every week in the trenches.\par \par \uc2 The effect of the war on London life was also evident in much more visible ways. Anti-aircraft guns appeared on top of buildings.\par \par \uc2 Lakes in parks were drained to stop the moonlight glitter providing enemy bombers with landmarks. Long queues appeared everywhere, particularly after 1917, when food shortages increased.\par \par \uc2 In December of that year, potatoes were nowhere to be found, and sugar, tea and meat were all so thin on the ground that queues 3,000 people long were not unusual.\par \par \uc2 Needless to say, most people made do, however unsatisfactorily: Robert Graves recalled that his wedding cake was adorned with what looked like fancy icing but turned out to be a plaster cast. When it was lifted off, \u8216\'20\'18a sigh of disappointment rose from the guests\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 White is wonderfully skilful at interweaving the tangible and the intangible, the conscious and the unconscious.\par \par \uc2 Rumours abounded: the Germans had started invading on the East Coast, or they were dropping poisoned sweets from their Zeppelins.\par \par \uc2 The prostitutes around the railway stations \u8211\'20\'13 Waterloo was popularly known as Whoreterloo \u8211\'20\'13 were rumoured to be drugging soldiers, then robbing them.\par \par \uc2 Whether or not the number of prostitutes actually increased during the war is hard to say, but it was certainly thought that they did, so much so that the Prime Minister of Canada vowed that in future neither he nor any successor would allow troops into Britain.\par \par \uc2 The real danger, he said, lay not in the trenches but from \u8216\'20\'18women on the London streets who are the real cause of the downfall of their men\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 In other ways, the great London railway stations were transformed into settings for the most vivid and heartfelt drama, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers leaving, never to return, or finally returning, but as invalids.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18We hear an incessant muffled roar of trains all night; it is like the roaring of the sea,\u8217\'20\'19 wrote someone living near Euston.\par \par \uc2 'A vicar\u8217\'20\'19s wife who went to Victoria to bid farewell to her son noted that \u8216\'20\'18what struck me most was the cheerful bravery of the women who sent their men off almost invariably with smiles\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 After the worst few months of the war \u8211\'20\'13196,000 men were killed or wounded in July 1916 alone \u8211\'20\'13 one Londoner observed that \u8216\'20\'18I cannot pass the gates of Charing Cross station at any hour of the day without a choking sensation in the throat.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18There, day by day, during these big \u8220\'20\'1Cpush\u8221\'20\'1D operations, you see a deep double line of people, mostly women, standing mutely and hourly from the doors of the station to the Strand entrance and even beyond, watching the outpouring motors and ambulances filled with the wounded...\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18There is no cheering. Just a little waving of handkerchiefs from women with tear-stained faces, and as each motor goes down the line the women gently fling roses\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 EVENT BOOKSTORE\par \par \uc2 To buy books direct from us call: \u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0 \u9742\'26\'0E 0844 472 4157 or visit mailbookshop.co.uk/event \u163\'00\'A320 including free P&P\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140426ea4q007y6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Travel Pages\par \b \uc2 Travel: Italy Special: TheWayISeeIt: Giorgio Locatelli: Ancient Roman bikinis, Arabic couscous and the world's best ice-cream ... The Italian chef tells of his soft spot for Sicily\b0\par\par\uc2 Giorgio Locatelli Interview by Rachel Dixon   \par \uc2 1,147 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 April 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Sicily is the most exotic place in Europe. It was the most important piece of land in the Mediterranean for thousands of years and lots of Greek and Arabic influences remain.\par \par \uc2 I'm from northern Italy and I didn't go to Sicily until I was in my 30s. I've been back many times with my family. I've put Sicilian dishes on the menu at [my London restaurant] Locanda Locatelli. Sicily changed my cooking: I now use fennel, pistachios, almonds . . .\par \par \uc2 The first thing to do when you arrive is rent a car. Italy doesn't have a well-developed public transport system, and in Sicily it is catastrophic. But the roads are quite good so you can let it rip! There is so much to do: spend a couple of days in each place and then move on.\par \par \uc2 My perfect day would be spent in Mazara del Vallo, a big fishing port. In 1998, a local fisherman caught a statue of a dancing figure in his nets. It turned out to be an ancient bronze satyr, cast between the fourth and second centuries BC. (I've met the fisherman who landed it - he can often be found in the local bars.) The Dancing Satyr is now on display at the town's Museo del Satiro in the church of Sant'Egidio. The statue is so beautiful and elegant, and most of the time you have the little museum to yourself, but there were huge queues when it came to London's Royal Academy in 2012. Afterwards I'd go to one of the Tunisian bakeries or restaurants - there are lots of Tunisian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  in Mazara.\par \par \uc2 The most famous archaeological site is the Valley of Temples in Agrigento, but I love Selinunte, further up the coast. The landscape is wilder there. I walk from the beach up and around the remains of the acropolis, necropolis and old market, all from about 650BC. The view is incredible and you can feel the presence of the ancient Greeks.\par \par \uc2 The island has so many magical places: the ancient amphitheatres of Syracuse; the little town of Erice, where there are more churches than houses; the Norman cathedral of Monreale. The Villa Romana del Casale, just outside the town of Piazza Armerina, has an incredible collection of Roman mosaics. They include beautiful mosaics of girls in bikinis. Romans! In bikinis! My kids thought that was so funny; they loved it.\par \par \uc2 Enna, in the centre of the island, is a huge stone with a town on top. It is so breathtaking, I can't believe it exists. It has wonderful Easter celebrations, as does Modica in the south.\par \par \uc2 Mount Etna, one of the most active volcanoes in the world, is also one of the most beautiful areas of Sicily. You can take the cable car up to 2,500m and then walk to the crater. Make sure you wear warm clothes, even in summer. The view from the top is unbelievable.\par \par \uc2 Palermo is fantastic for markets. La Vucciria and Ballaro are two of the most exciting, with an Arabic vibe and a craziness reminiscent of Bangkok. You can also buy a beautifully made suit in Palermo, from one of the old sartorie (tailors).\par \par \uc2 A symphony between land and people still exists here. There is a great fishing culture. In Sciacca, you can buy fish direct from the boats - a euros 10 box of sardines will feed 20 people.\par \par \uc2 Food is very seasonal, fresh and cheap. Look around you for pine kernels, pistachios, artichokes. Almonds from Noto. The best peaches are found on street corners in Triscina. When a mafia boss was found in hiding in Sicily, all he had in his fridge was bitter chicory and ricotta. He was probably worth a couple of billion! But in Sicily, you don't need a huge variety of ingredients.\par \par \uc2 The dish that epitomises Sicily is pasta con le sarde from Palermo, made with sardines, fennel, saffron, pine kernels, sultanas and a light, sweet tomato sauce. I also love Sicilian fish couscous, which reflects the island's Arabic heritage - there is a couscous championship once a year in San Vito lo Capo (6-8 June, couscousfest.it).\par \par \uc2 The olive oil is exceptionally good. Groves near the sea have a salinity that you can't get anywhere else in Italy. I bought some groves and I make my own unfiltered, velvety oil on an estate in Agrigento province.\par \par \uc2 The street food in Palermo is incredible, such as stigghiola (stuffed, grilled lamb intestines) and pane con la milza (spleen sandwiches). In Bagheria you can get the best sfincione (Sicilian pizza). The dough is sweet and soft with the fluffiness of a cloud, almost like a doughnut, and it is topped with onion and anchovies but no tomatoes. (Bagheria also has a fantastic museum dedicated to the painter Renato Guttuso, museoguttuso.it.)\par \par \uc2 My favourite place to eat is Da Vittoria (ristorantevittorio.it) in Porto Palo di Menfi. A restaurant with rooms, it serves traditional Sicilian fish dishes right on the beach. There is no menu: you get antipasti and pasta and grilled fish. It's very friendly and relaxed: if you want another bottle of wine, you help yourself from the fridge. Palermitanos go there, and it's just off one of the major wine routes, so there are usually a few wine tourists too - Sicily makes fantastic wine.\par \par \uc2 The best ice-cream in the world is at Caffe Sicilia in Noto. Noto is a beautiful town - it was destroyed by an earthquake in 1693 and rebuilt 8km away, so it's like a stage set. The baroque centre, with a duomo and dozens of churches, is a world heritage site.\par \par \uc2 The beach at San Vito lo Capo is like the Caribbean - white sand, beautiful sea - and is part of the Zingaro nature reserve.\par \par \uc2 My favourite hotel is La Foresteria (doubles from euros 90, planetaestate.it), an exceptional place on top of a little hill in wine country. There is a beautiful pool, gardens with 16 kinds of sage, an estate with 250 kinds of birds. Guests all eat together around a big, 30-seat dining table.\par \par \uc2 Tourists often worry about the mafia but there's no need. Most Sicilians are good people and I've never experienced any crime.\par \par \uc2 * Giorgio Locatelli is chef patron of Locanda Locatelli in London (locandalocatelli.com).

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In 1969, the great Scottish poet Tom Leonard imagined a Glasgow crucifixion. The Good Thief leans from his cross to address Christ, friendly fashion, in his native tongue - "heh jimmy" - and to ask him the crucial Glasgow question, the one that can also be phrased as: "Are you are a Celtic supporter and do you kick with the left foot?". "Ma right insane yirra pape?" The thief is happily confident that Jesus is with him: "yirwanny us jimmy / see it nyir eyes /wanny uz".\par \par \uc2 Ah, the great wen of ancient feeling, hot loyalty and shameful acts that is Scottish sectarianism. We haven't heard much about it in the independence debate - which makes Rachel Seiffert's unsparing, thoughtful and immaculately researched novel all the braver and more welcome. Opening in the present, but mostly set in the 1990s, it tells the story of a Glasgow boy, Graham, who falls desperately in love with a Northern Irish girl, Lindsey, while visiting County Tyrone with his Orange marching band. At first, the birth of their son, and Graham's warm and loving family, especially his mother Brenda and her artist brother Eric, seem to offer Lindsey an escape from an unhappy childhood and an abusive father; but gradually Graham is called by his talent for the Lambeg drum back into his limited sectarian ways, and Lindsey finds the life she is offered harder and harder to live. The effect of this on their son is played out through his interactions with contemporary Polish \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , who are also in the process of deciding what is home.\par \par \uc2 Seiffert (pictured) has a fine ear for Glasgow speech and an even better eye for images. Graham and Lindsey, young and in love, sharing a bicycle: "The girl kept her fingers hooked into Graham's belt loops, her arms rising and falling while he stood on the pedals; her spine dead straight, arms slender, all her limbs, and her face showing nothing, but taking everything in"; Eric's pencil sketches of Glasgow, both naturalistic and in the grip of a biblical apocalypse; Stevie's red hair and freckles, appearing and disappearing in the crowd; Jozef the Polish builder's eagle eye on the city from an unfinished flat: all contribute to a rich, nuanced portrait of a changing community, and all are beautifully, sparely rendered.\par \par \uc2 Through the images, three strands of story emerge: that of Graham and his family; that of Eric, his art and his tragic marriage to a Catholic; and the anxieties of Jozef. Each is authentic and convincing, but they are told overwhelmingly through individual reminiscence, with a bare minimum of interaction between characters in the present. Often, in fact, the connections between the strands are so glancing that the tales seem to interrupt rather than supplement each other, to the point where you wonder if this book might not have been better arranged, like Seiffert's first novel, The Dark Room, as a triptych of novellas.\par \par \uc2 The sharp, imagistic exits of a novella might also have granted Seiffert's central characters a little extra grace. As it is, all five are weighted with the difficult task of embodying unbridgable gaps, not for the space of a few pages, but for an entire novel. Graham cannot let go his Lambeg, nor Lindsey talk about her dad, or the essential tragedy of their circumstances will be lost; nor can Eric have a happy marriage or be discovered by the \uc2 Glasgow School of Art\uc2 ; nor Jozef impulsively hop on the plane to Gdansk. Stevie, victim and vehicle of all these disputes, cannot contact his family; nor can his family talk to him, because the problem is, they can't talk. So the characters get bogged down in years of inarticulate hiatuses, and the reader chafes. While this does bring home the multiple awfulness of sectarian repression, it also risks the characters, otherwise so richly drawn and gifted with so many delicate feelings, seeming blank, or passive.\par \par \uc2 The same solemnity also seems to deprive these Glaswegians of a characteristic almost as essential as the rhythms that Seiffert hears so well: jokes are said to be told, but none are actually cracked, perhaps because humour would open too many channels of communication. But Glaswegians will tell jokes about anything, really, and to anyone: ironies so black you cannot believe they are ironies, jokes about the very worst thing in the world. As Leonard's Good Thief remarks to Christ, the trouble with a crucifixion is you miss the football:\par \par \uc2 gonny miss thi GEMM jimmy\par \par \uc2 nearly three a cloke thinoo\par \par \uc2 dork init\par \par \uc2 good jobe theyve gote the lights\par \par \uc2 Kate Clanchy's Meeting the English is published by Picador.

His immediate predecessor was an Etonian who hadn't read his own party's manifesto. Its elected officials have called women sluts, been jailed for benefit fraud, and blamed the floods on gay marriage. Its only consistent political success is in elections to a body its supporters want no part of under a system its leader despises.\par \par \uc2 So why has this party - without a single seat in parliament - managed to change government and opposition policy on what many voters think to be the most important issue of the day? How did its leader persuade the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, into a suicide mission on prime time television? Why - next month - is it threatening to be the first third party to win a nationwide election since the end of the first world war?\par \par \uc2 In their answer to these questions, Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin have come up with something of a scoop, albeit one which they and others have been flagging up for a while. Revolt of the Right begins with a brisk summary of the UK Independence party story. Founded in 1991 by former Liberal and LSE lecturer Alan Sked, the party spent its early years being outpolled by the Monster Raving Loonies. Six years later, in the first of many bouts of infighting, Sked was overthrown in a coup. Under New Labour, Ukip was subject to infiltration by members of the BNP (until, that is, the BNP started beating them regularly in local elections) and split between those who saw it as a group to exert pressure on the Conservatives, and those who wanted it to be an electoral force in its own right.\par \par \uc2 In 2004, the party was given an unexpected boost by winning the support of former Labour MP and television presenter Robert Kilroy-Silk, who got himself elected to the European parliament, was appalled by the reactionary politics of his new colleagues, failed to win the leadership and, in the words of an activist, "disappeared in a puff of vanity". As the 2010 election approached, the party began to take domestic polls more seriously. Its 2010 manifesto called for a dress code for taxi drivers and the banning of the burka, but won them more than 900,000 votes (3.1% of the total). But their real breakthrough came in a series of second-place results in recent byelections, and in the county council elections of 2013. The Conservative terror - that this funny little fruitcake fringe party could hand the keys of Downing Street to Ed Miliband - had suddenly become a real possibility.\par \par \uc2 That Ukip is, in Peter Oborne's words, essentially "the Conservative party in exile" has been the conventional wisdom of the commentariat, including those Tories who'd like their leadership to listen less to Clegg. For Ford and Goodwin, the reason why Ukip may win the European elections is very different. In the core chapters of their book, they look first at the social and economic changes which, throughout Europe, have reduced the political power of the working class. In 1964 almost half the British workforce did blue collar jobs, 40% were in unions and 70% had no formal educational qualifications. Now manual jobs represent less than 30% of the total, fewer than 20% of people are in unions, and voters with educational qualifications equal those without. Old, white, impoverished males - once the people who decided elections - have been left behind, becoming little more than spectators of a political battlefield now dominated by a university-trained metropolitan elite. Hence the huge drop in the numbers voting in the Labour heartlands, not just in 2010, but also in 2005.\par \par \uc2 Crunching 10 years' worth of data on 124,000 British voters (5,593 of whom intend to vote Ukip in 2015), Ford and Goodwin have found that it is this group, rather than the red-faced golf\u8209\'20\'11club bar bores of cartoonists' imaginations, who have brought about the transformation in Ukip's fortunes. In doing so, the party is, of course, drinking at the same well as the BNP (though - untainted with Nazi links - in much larger numbers). Like other radical-right voters across the continent, Ukip supporters oppose the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , dislike \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , distrust mainstream politicians of all parties and are pessimistic about the future. Far from being a danger solely to the Conservatives, its runner-up showings in Barnsley, Rotherham and South Shields suggest that Ukip is as big, if not a bigger threat to Labour.\par \par \uc2 If that proves correct, then the party faces an existential challenge. As Ford and Goodwin put it: "During an economically rightwing administration that is pursuing an austerity agenda, the left-behind social groups who stand to lose the most show greater enthusiasm for Ukip's radical right insurgency than for the party traditionally associated with state support for the most vulnerable". If Labour loses these people, then it doesn't just lose its electoral base, but also its reason for being.\par \par \uc2 But there are some caveats. The data on which Ford and Goodwin base their analysis of Ukip voters consists, as they acknowledge, of people who intend to vote Ukip, rather than those who have. On the occasions when Ukip's vote increases dramatically (such as in European elections) their new or temporary voters are more likely to be middle-class, financially secure and from Conservative backgrounds. And, while Ukip did indeed attract more former Labour voters during the later New Labour years, they have won a substantially higher proportion of Tory voters since the coalition came to power.\par \par \uc2 So there might be another explanation for the high Ukip vote in Labour areas. As the BBC's political research editor, David Cowling, points out, in Labour's safest seat in the country at the 2010 election, 28% of voters still supported other parties. This is not because Liverpool Walton is peppered with enclaves of bankers and stockbrokers; it's because a substantial section of the working class has always voted for parties other than Labour and now that vote is going to Ukip. Ford and Goodwin argue that Ukip's success has reduced the swing to Labour among old, poor and male voters. But that's different from saying that Ukip is eating into the existing Labour vote, as it clearly is into the Conservatives'.\par \par \uc2 A little oddly for authors of so fact-packed a study, Ford and Goodwin have invented a generic Ukip voter called John, a 64-year-old former Raleigh bicycle worker in Nottingham, who voted for Thatcher, switched to Labour after she resigned, flirted with the BNP (but couldn't stomach the Nazi associations) and was converted by a Ukip election broadcast in 2009. By contrast, Nigel Farage imagines his emblematic supporter as someone who has worked abroad for 30 years, retires to Britain, turns on the 10 o'clock news and cries "What?!". The future of both major British parties may turn on which of those models is right.\par \par \uc2 To order Revolt on the Right with free UK p&p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140426ea4q0001o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

Edited by John Mair, Richard Tait, Richard Lance Keeble 308pp, Abramis, pounds 19.95\b0\par\par\uc2 Ian Jack   \par \uc2 1,752 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 April 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A book in which three editors and 30 contributors address a single question inevitably risks repeating the same information, and the editors of this volume, all of them media academics (or "hackademics" as they style themselves) seem not to have worried too much about duplicating facts or even making them consistent. Some facts, however, do bear repetition, and I was happy to come across the following figures twice. When \uc2 John Smith\uc2  quit as chief executive of BBC Worldwide in December 2012, his \uc2 BBC\uc2  pension pot stood at roughly pounds 5m. He wasn't fired - he left to become chief operating officer at Burberry on pounds 575,000 a year. Nonetheless, he also took with him a bonus of pounds 222,000; another pounds 386,000 comprising deferred bonuses, profit-sharing bonuses and taxable benefits; and a year's salary in lieu of notice.\par \par \uc2  Altogether the \uc2 BBC\uc2  paid him pounds 1,396,000 in his last year of service, though he later returned half a year's pay (the sum was either pounds 205,000 or pounds 244,000 depending on which of the book's writers you believe).\par \par \uc2 True, Worldwide is the \uc2 BBC\uc2 's commercial wing - the part that makes money rather than spends it - and during Smith's eight-year tenure it made a steady profit (pounds 112m in 2004/05, pounds 125m in 2011/12, both figures at 2014 prices). But Worldwide couldn't exist without public funding; in \uc2 Michael Grade\uc2 's definition, its core role is to exploit the intellectual property funded by the licence fee. And in any case, Smith had spent the previous 15 years of his career in the \uc2 BBC\uc2  mainstream, shielded from the allegedly brutal hire-and-fire of the free market. A pension pot of pounds 5m was certainly a grand reward, potentially yielding a tax-free lump sum of pounds 1.25m and a lifetime's income of pounds 200,000 a year, even at today's miserable annuity rates.\par \par \uc2 Of all the uproarious scandals that have recently beset the \uc2 BBC\uc2  - the unexposed guilt of Jimmy Savile, the tarnished innocence of Lord McAlpine - the one least easily explained as a combination of unfortunate coincidences are the lavish pay-offs engineered by what the present director-general, \uc2 Tony Hall\uc2 , calls its "officer class". Under pressure from the BBC Trust to reduce the corporation's bureaucracy, the then DG, \uc2 Mark Thompson\uc2 , sacked 150 senior managers over the years 2010-2012 at a cost of pounds 25m in severance payments, pounds 1.4m of which the \uc2 BBC\uc2  was not contractually obliged to pay. The management was ingenious in its generosity. It found a way, for example, to give nearly pounds 400,000 to its director of marketing and audiences, who was strictly ineligible for severance pay because she'd worked continuously for the \uc2 BBC\uc2  for only 17 months. Of the excess as a whole, Margaret Hodge, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, blamed the corruptions of the club. "There was a culture at the top where people had known each other for years and years . . . it seemed right [to them] they should look after each other when they lost their jobs, giving out lots of money in unacceptably high pay-offs."\par \par \uc2 But big pay-offs need big salaries. How did the \uc2 BBC\uc2  come to pay its executives so much in the first place? Nicholas Jones and Suzanne Franks, two former \uc2 BBC\uc2  journalists, name John Birt as the culprit. The BBC governors had acquiesced to his demand that his DG's salary be paid to him via his private company, thereby reducing his tax burden. Nobody would have objected to this arrangement at Birt's previous employer, London Weekend, but it caused outrage at the \uc2 BBC\uc2 . To appease opinion, the corporation put Birt on staff and PAYE, but at the same time increased his salary to compensate for his extra tax liabilities. Franks describes the episode as "the beginning of the collision of private sector and public service expectations". The old officer class balanced relatively low salaries against job security, generous pensions and perks such as Centre Court seats. The new officer class wanted (and got) salaries and bonuses that compared nicely with their rivals at ITV, while their perks now ran to private health insurance.\par \par \uc2 In Franks' words, managers were paid "eye-watering salaries on the basis that this was what the market required to retain their talents. But it was never really explained where exactly the temptations might come from to lure away their services." Adjusted for inflation, Thompson's "package" as DG in 2008/9 was four times as much as \uc2 Alasdair Milne\uc2  earned in the same job 20 years earlier. Meanwhile the titles and numbers of the boss class lengthened and increased, alienating the programme-making staff who kept the \uc2 BBC\uc2 's reputation alive in a climate that has often been politically and commercially hostile, with enmity from governments on the one hand and the Murdoch family on the other (if, that is, those two hands can be differentiated).\par \par \uc2 Trimming this executive largesse became essential when in 2010 the incoming coalition froze the licence fee at pounds 145.50, which meant cutting the budget by 16% until the present term of the \uc2 BBC\uc2 's royal charter, renewable every 10 years, runs out at the end of 2016. None of the largesse had been a secret. In a celebrated Today programme encounter the novelist PD James told Thompson that the \uc2 BBC\uc2  seemed to her "like a very large and unwieldy ship that's been floating there since 1920, taking on more and more and more cargo, building more decks to accommodate it, recruiting more officers, all very comfortably cabined, usually at salaries far greater than their predecessors enjoyed and with a crew somewhat discontented and some a little mutinous." It became scandalous mainly in retrospect, after the chair of the BBC Trust, \uc2 Chris Patten\uc2 , agreed that his ill-fated DG, \uc2 George Entwistle\uc2 , receive a pounds 450,000 pay-off after only 54 days in the job. It was twice his legal due.\par \par \uc2 Of course, to a banker this money (aka "a reward for failure") would be chickenfeed; even in the etiolated world of newspaper editors, it wouldn't raise too many eyebrows. But pounds 450k to the average licence payer represents a large multiple of their annual earnings and is therefore an attractive snippet of evidence that a government can add to its argument for reducing the \uc2 BBC\uc2 's power and scope. "The political vultures have already been circling," writes Raymond Snoddy of the next licence-fee negotiation, pointing to a warning by Grant Shapps, the Tory party chair, that the \uc2 BBC\uc2  could lose exclusive rights to the licence fee unless it tackled what he described as a culture of secrecy, waste and "unbalanced reporting". Snoddy predicts that the next negotiation over the licence will be "the most difficult and unpredictable there has ever been".\par \par \uc2 Britain has no more culturally important institution than the \uc2 BBC\uc2 ; it is to Britain's soft (and softening) power what the Grand Fleet was to the hard-edged empire, loved at home and respected abroad, one of those things that in Grade's description helps define "the curious, often mystical aura of Great Britain". Politicians who would like to weaken it - by, for example, "top-slicing" and redistributing the licence fee - are surely no more than pygmy ideologues who lack the imagination to understand the irreparable consequences of their dreams. Still, does the \uc2 BBC\uc2  try to do too much? Would it be better if it did less? The hostility it attracts from newspapers isn't always prompted by political belief (the Mail) or the drive to increase the market share of the newspaper publisher's associated TV station (Murdoch). The \uc2 BBC\uc2 's ambitious online news site, which can be accessed without charge anywhere in the world, holds back newspapers from monetising their own digital output from fear of losing their traffic to their publicly funded rival. Perhaps nothing can (or should) be done about that, but Peter Preston, a former Guardian editor, makes a good case for the \uc2 BBC\uc2  abandoning its commitment to local radio on the grounds that England's 39 stations have damaged local newspapers, which "founded bottom-up in existing communities" - rather than planted by \uc2 BBC\uc2  diktat - "are more natural growths with deeper ties". Local radio piggybacks for its news on the local paper; unlike the local paper editor, however, the station manager earns pounds 100,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 Preston's is one of many insightful essays in an anthology that does itself no favours by describing its writers as "an unprecedented galaxy of movers and shakers (past and present) in British broadcasting". Vin Ray's day-by-day narration of Newsnight's lamentable McAlpine episode, which cost Entwistle his job, stands out as an excellent piece of sympathetic reporting. \uc2 David Elstein\uc2 's case for subscription funding is also impressive as a fact-strewn polemic - until that is, one reaches the strangest passage in the book, in which Elstein, recounting the reasons the licence fee might survive, writes, "first, population growth has resumed, and is forecast to accelerate. Although the \uc2 BBC\uc2  might feel nervous about being one of the few public bodies with a vested interest in mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , the connection between that phenomenon and \uc2 BBC\uc2  revenues is little understood among the general public." (What connection? And with what result?)\par \par \uc2 So is the \uc2 BBC\uc2  in crisis? The consensus seems to be, not yet - though it soon may well be. Steven Barnett predicts a gathering tide of anti-BBCism from Tory politicians and newspapers in the runup to the charter renewal. He writes: "If Britain wants to sustain a cultural institution which is still trusted and enjoyed by the vast majority of its own citizens while being praised and admired throughout the world, we must have the political will to make the resources available." In other words, an inflation-linked licence fee must be restored (and wisely spent). That, rather than the history of the sexual predators it once employed, will be the \uc2 BBC\uc2 's make or break.\par \par \uc2 Is the \uc2 BBC\uc2  in Crisis? is available from Abramis Academic Publishing. abramis.co.uk.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 An aerial view of Broadcasting House in London\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140426ea4q0001n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 \u10002\'27\'12 Charles Moore's authorised biography of Margaret Thatcher has been shortlisted for the Orwell prize, the prestigious literary award for political writing set up in honour of George Orwell.\par \par \uc2 The award, which aims to reward the book that comes closest to Orwell's ambition "to make political writing into an art", had already drawn fire for its longlisting of the rightwing journalist's biography of the late former prime minister, with Conrad Landin suggesting in the Independent that Orwell would have had "cutting words" about a prize "heaping laurels on establishment figures who write about fashionable establishment subjects", instead of rewarding writers who "say the unsayable". But the director of the prize, Jean Seaton said she had "lost count of the number of people who come up to me and wag their fingers and say they know Orwell would be turning in his grave about this or that".\par \par \uc2 "Orwell was never one for not noticing reality, and she mattered," Seaton said of Thatcher, and Moore's biography. "I think he would say that the book is incredibly adept and sharp and astute about her. Personally, I think it is an extraordinary book, a psychological insight into her, although just at the end he arrives on the side of her politics."\par \par \uc2 Orwell, Seaton speculated, "would have read [the biography] but what he would have thought of it I don't know. That's the thing about Orwell - he is not predictable. And I'm not going to let Orwell be captured by some parts of the political spectrum. He was a radical, both in his ideas and his extraordinary integrity."\par \par \uc2 Moore's biography is competing for the pounds 3,000 award with former home secretary \uc2 Alan Johnson\uc2 's memoir of his childhood, This Boy, and David Goodhart's controversial claim that mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is damaging, The British Dream. The prize shortlist is completed with James Fergusson's in-depth look at Somalia, The World's Most Dangerous Place, Gaiutra Bahadur's Coolie Woman, the journalist's pursuit of her great-grandmother's story - a pregnant woman who sailed from India to Guyana as a "coolie" in 1903 - and Frank Dikotter's history of the Chinese revolution, The Tragedy of Liberation\par \par \uc2 The six books were chosen from 235 entries by judges Sue MacGregor, Robert McCrum and Trevor Phillips, with the winner to be announced on 21 May.\par \par \uc2 The shortlist:\par \par \uc2 Coolie Woman by Gaiutra Bahadur (Hurst)\par \par \uc2 The Tragedy of Liberation by Frank Dikotter (Bloomsbury)\par \par \uc2 The World's Most Dangerous Place\par \par \uc2 by James Fergusson\par \par \uc2 (Bantam)\par \par \uc2 The British Dream by David Goodhart (Atlantic)\par \par \uc2 This Boy by \uc2 Alan Johnson\par \par \uc2 (Bantam)\par \par \uc2 Margaret Thatcher: The Authorised Biography by Charles Moore\par \par \uc2 (Allen Lane)\par \par \uc2 Alison Flood\par \par \uc2 \u10002\'27\'12Literature about literature is booming. The early months of 2014 alone have seen novels depicting Thomas Hardy (by Christopher Nicholson), Mr and Mrs Hemingway (Naomi Wood), Nuala O'Faolain (Hugo Hamilton), Baudelaire (James MacManus), the Blakes and the Mandelstams (David Park), Conan Doyle (Valerie Martin) and EM Forster (Damon Galgut). John Banville produced a homage to Raymond Chandler, Val McDermid an affectionate update of Jane Austen.\par \par \uc2 Among the highest profile titles have been a memoir-like "novel" about the life of a novelist (Karl Ove Knausgaard's A Death in the Family), and a novel about a novelist researching a biography of a novelist, generally assumed to be based on VS Naipaul (Hanif Kureishi's The Last Word\par \par \uc2 Soon joining this festival of self-consciousness will be Edward St Aubyn's Lost for Words, which, like Howard Jacobson's most recent novel Zoo Time - published after he surprised himself by winning the Booker, but conceived and at least partly written before then - is an act of revenge on the book world.\par \par \uc2 A Booker shortlistee (unlucky to lose, many felt) with Mother's Milk in 2006, who then saw At Last omitted even from the longlist in 2011, St Aubyn constructs a farce centring on the judges of the Elysian prize: bored backbench MP Malcolm, Oxford English don Vanessa, civil servant and thriller writer Penny, actor Tobias and columnist Jo.\par \par \uc2 Though St Aubyn is careful to include details that prevent one-to-one correspondence, the models are not hard to identify. Ex-MP Chris Mullin was the 2011 judge who voiced a bias in favour of books that "zip along", and \uc2 Stella Rimington\uc2  - formerly of \uc2 MI5\uc2  rather than, like Penny, the Foreign Office - chaired that year's notorious panel. (St Aubyn seems to feel comparatively little need to conceal the fact that he's caricaturing her, and includes ruthless parodies of her Liz Carlyle thrillers).\par \par \uc2 The character of Tobias nods to the choice of Dan Stevens as a judge in 2012, while Vanessa can't fail to recall - in her job and probably her insistence on literary values, though not in other respects - Oxford don and former English professor Hermione Lee, who chaired the panel that picked Kiran Desai, and not St Aubyn, in 2006.\par \par \uc2 Only Jo lacks an obvious referent, as female columnists have judged other prizes but not the Booker: the novelist may, though, have in mind Susan Hill, a combative commentator on book issues who was a member of Rimington's team.\par \par \uc2 In ridiculing these thinly disguised figures, who in the course of the novel are subjected either to public humiliation or private pain, St Aubyn adds his name to a British tradition of literary revenge that includes giving a series of murder victims the names of theatre critics (\uc2 Simon Gray\uc2 ), fooling a rival biographer with a fake letter (Bevis Hillier feuding with AN Wilson), naming a goat (Jilly Cooper's Chisolm, a whack at Anne Chisholm) or a pair of crooks (DJ Taylor's Davenport and Hines, hitting back at Richard Davenport-Hines) after hostile reviewers, or turning a disobliging interviewer into a frumpy, boozy hackette, as portrayed by Melvyn Bragg not long after being profiled by Lynn Barber. Probably not before, though, have prize judges been the targets.\par \par \uc2 John Dugdale\par \par \uc2 \u10002\'27\'12Elizabeth Gilbert (pictured) is selling her house in New Jersey, offering her fans an appetising opportunity to play a part in the inevitable follow-up memoir to Eat, Pray, Love, and so potentially become a character in the hit Julia Roberts movie's sequel. On a dedicated website called Eat, Pray, Crib, Gilbert deploys all her gifts for gush in depicting the nine-room "mini-estate" (confusingly described as "Italianate Victorian" in style) as so perfect that her need to move is puzzling.\par \par \uc2 Apparently it's so she and Jose - the Brazilian importer who provides the book with its happy ending, played by Javier Bardem in the film - can live closer to Two Buttons, their "pan-Asian emporium" in Frenchtown, NJ, which is so called because the two "lifelong travellers" were told by "a priest in Laos that we had so much love for life that we needed nothing more than two buttons in our pockets to get by in this world".\par \par \uc2 Happily, her subsequent book and film earnings mean the priest's words will never have to be tested, and the house sale - asking price: $999,000 - will take her further away from her years as a restless, far from affluent nomad hunting for a guy and a guru. Judging by Gilbert's paean to the property, though, it seems if anything to be underpriced: among its attractions are a 500-bottle wine cellar, a "chef's kitchen", a "powder room [with] an automated Japanese toilet-bidet and an exotic Balinese lava stone sink", and above all an attic "Skybrary" ("handcrafted for me over three years by a master woodworker") that is "too magical to be described".\par \par \uc2 What may surprise admirers with a spare million dollars, however, is the lack of dedicated spaces for spiritual activity - there's no shrine, and even yoga is only catered for in a brisk mention of a "tastefully designed workout/yoga/home gym area". Religion seems unlikely to figure in the title of Gilbert's next autobiographical volume, though it may be too cynical to guess that it might be called Write, Decorate, Sell.

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage hasn't changed a bit, and yet everything is different. He suggests we meet in a village in Stockton-on-Tees for a "lovely pub lunch", which turns out to consist of three pints of ale, lots of cigarettes, and no food whatsoever. Already he is hoarse, and it's only day two of his grand tour of the north. "I gave myself a stern talking-to yesterday on the way up to Sheffield, and told myself not to overdo it," but then 600 supporters turned up for Ukip's launch rally - "It was like a Billy Graham meeting!" - and so of course the evening got a bit out of hand, and he got to bed at "oh, you know, aherm, five past". But straight after lunch he bounds back on to the tour bus - "I've got to go and liberate a country" - and sets off for a nearby town walkabout, which winds up in another pub. Dressed in a startling mustard corduroy ensemble, and mobbed by a scrum of local media, he looks like the happiest man in the world.\par \par \uc2 But by his normal standards, this is an operation of military discipline. If all goes to plan, his party is four weeks away from pulling off "one of the biggest upsets in British political history", and its leader is taking no chances. If Tony Blair, as Roy Jenkins once said, approached the 1997 election "as if carrying a Ming vase across a polished floor", then Farage is inching towards 22 May like a barmaid balancing an overloaded beer tray.\par \par \uc2 He now travels with a security detail of four big men in suits and earpieces, which is costing Ukip a fortune and driving him mad. "I'm a completely free spirit, and of course these guys are used to meticulous timing, so I hate it." But he was whacked over the head with a placard in Margate recently, "and if I hadn't had them with me I'd have been in hospital". He watched the first televised debate with Nick Clegg, "And I thought I was irritable. Bit red. A touch sweaty, possibly. So I went into training for the second debate. I did, I did! Cos I thought, this is really important, this actually really bloody matters. I've got to get this right, I've got to get myself in shape for this." For four whole days he didn't drink, he went walking on the North Downs, had a few morning swims, "and actually got myself into a position where I wasn't knackered, I wasn't boozed up, and I was actually fit to do the debate. And I think it worked." He did have one glass of red just before the second debate, but only really on principle. "We got to the green room and there was just mineral water! I said: 'We can't be doing with this sort of thing, we want a bottle of white and a bottle of red or I'm not going on.' "\par \par \uc2 He has also had to learn how to say as little as possible - something else he clearly hates. "But we are fighting this election on who governs our country," so Farage point-blank refuses to specify a single Ukip policy before 22 May, other than withdrawal from Europe ("Oh, and bringing back grammar schools, you can have that"). He even refuses to rule out any of the policies that featured in the party's 2010 manifesto, a document he describes as a "load of late-night ramblings" and has never actually read. Will he not even rule out one of its more memorable pledges, the compulsory dress code for taxi drivers? "I've burned all 400-odd pages of it, burned it all, so I'm not prepared to discuss any of it."\par \par \uc2 Self-censorship doesn't really suit Farage, so he resorts to suppressed giggles and frantic gurning whenever he won't let himself answer a question, casting himself more as a mate planning a surprise birthday party than a slippery politician evading scrutiny. When it comes to Ukip policies already on the record, if he can't defend them then he says they're simply nothing to do with him. For example, the party now requires all candidates to confirm that they have no skeletons in the closet that could cause embarrassment to the party, but what does that actually mean? "I've no idea. 'Could cause an embarrassment' could mean almost anything, couldn't it? I just hope I'm exempted." Are any candidates likely to disqualify themselves on the basis of this clause? "Depends how ambitious they are, I suppose. Oh, I don't know, I'm surprised they used the phrase to be honest. But as I say, I don't run everything."\par \par \uc2 Farage knows he can't rely on the party's original support base - "very middle-class, very below the M4, ex-military" - to deliver victory next month. So he is now chasing northern urban voters, and claims his party has become working-class. "What we've got to do in the next four weeks is rattle the Labour party. That's the big job for Ukip now. The middle-class Tories in Wiltshire have already decided whether they're going to vote Ukip on 22 May or not - and a lot of them are. So for the next four weeks the focus is on the Labour vote. If we're going to win these elections, those are the voters we want to get."\par \par \uc2 He is probably wise to steer clear of policy detail, for Ukip is now such an ideologically incoherent bandwagon that policy is no longer the point. Some of its supporters want to make dressing up for the theatre compulsory, while Farage is a libertarian who breaks the law "regularly" and says: "I'm not for laws. We need a minimum of laws. I hate big government, I hate being told what to do on a personal basis." But even he is a bit wary of libertarianism now, "because I've seen some of the loonier elements. A bloke took over our youth wing and called himself a libertarian, and he's for, I don't know," he shudders, "bestiality!" But he thinks he can sidestep all these contradictions, because none of them will matter on 22 May. "People are voting for difference. I think there's a feeling among our supporters that we speak for them and no one else does."\par \par \uc2 One problem for Farage is how to maintain his image as a chaotic amateur while communicating quite a shrewd electoral strategy. The key to winning next month, he explains, is to get the non-voters out. "Over one in five of our votes already come from non-voters. And in European elections only a third [of the electorate] vote, so it's a massive marketplace. And the more urban the area, the lower the turnout." If Ukip can beat Labour to first place - and the gap has closed to just a couple of points - "the grassroots pressure on Ed Miliband to promise a referendum will be irresistible. We need to get into a position where, whatever the outcome of the next election, we get a referendum."\par \par \uc2 He is enormously pleased with the Ukip posters he launched this week, one of which features a gigantic pointing finger beside the words: "26 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?" But as the BBC's political editor asked Farage this week, if he's so worried about Europeans taking our jobs, why does he employ his German wife as his secretary, at taxpayers' expense? "That line of argument from \uc2 Nick Robinson\uc2  was pathetic," he scoffs. "It just shows you how trivial the whole thing is." He has to employ his wife, he says, because nobody else could possibly work such antisocial hours so closely with him.\par \par \uc2 But other MEPs manage to employ secretaries to whom they are not married, don't they?\par \par \uc2 "How can you compare my life to any other MEP? I mean, come on, it's crackers, isn't it? Look, other MEPs do five days a week in Brussels and pop home for weekends. I'm working seven bloody days a week, all the hours God sends. If you include the socialising, it's over 100 hours a week." His wife is not the only \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  he has employed, it emerges; he has hired other Europeans, "because they had specialist skills - languages in particular". But he says British people should always try to employ a Brit over an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  wherever possible. "And is that discriminatory? Maybe it is." Is that what he would always do? "Of course I would, yeah."\par \par \uc2 The posters have been condemned across the political spectrum as racist, divisive and ignorant. He knew the\par \par \uc2 finger-pointing poster would be controversial, but can't for the life of him see how it could cause offence. "Shouldn't do. We should have gone further, really. What we could have done is say we've opened the door to 425 million people who are after your jobs. That would have been stronger." I suspect the decision not to had something to do with criticism of a notorious Ukip leaflet last year, which warned: "The EU will allow 29 million Bulgarians and Romanians to come to the UK." As the combined population of both countries did not, in the event, relocate to Britain on 1 January, you'd think he might be embarrassed about the baseless alarmism, but not a bit of it.\par \par \uc2 "Not at all. Two reasons, really. I think we don't know the true figures yet. And there's also the quality debate. People hate talking about this, but if you look at the Met crime figures for Romanian arrests, there have been 28,000 in London in the last five years. Is there a problem? Yeah. There is a problem." Is he saying there is a culture of criminality among Romanians? "Bound to be. You have to go and see it to understand it. I've visited camps in Romania and Bulgaria, I've got a pretty good understanding." Should British people be wary of Romanian families moving into their street? "Well, of course, yeah."\par \par \uc2 The poster campaign was funded by Ukip's main donor, the businessman Paul Sykes, but I'm not convinced that relations between the two men are quite as harmonious as Farage says, because he looks a little strained when I mention Sykes' name. The pair considered dozens of different poster designs, he says - so who had the final say? "Me." Sykes would have paid for posters he didn't choose? "We agreed. But if we hadn't agreed, we wouldn't have had them." After a brief pause, "I'm not for sale," he suddenly barks. "I'm not for sale." But Sykes' money is crucial, isn't it? "Well, his money makes a huge difference to us, of course it does," he says briskly. "I get on incredibly well with him, we're pretty eye-to-eye on lots of issues, and getting agreement on this campaign and how to do it has been very easy. Very easy." Yet Sykes still hasn't promised to bankroll Ukip's general election campaign. He says he's waiting to see how the party performs in May, so I ask Farage what Ukip has to do to secure Sykes' backing for 2015. "Well, you'd better ask him that." Hasn't Sykes told him? "No."\par \par \uc2 The party's finances are a perennial headache for Farage, and like most Ukip MEPs he has donated a chunk of his own money - pounds 11,000 last year, pounds 4,000 this year. It was recently reported that the party is drawing up an MEPs' charter, demanding a compulsory donation from each MEP of pounds 50,000, but Farage says it will stipulate only a "reasonable sum", which in his case will be "two to three grand". He recently described himself as "broke", but has a household income of just over pounds 100,000. How can Ukip be a working-class party if it will only accept candidates wealthy enough to donate thousands? "They wouldn't have their jobs as MEPs if it weren't for Ukip."\par \par \uc2 Money has become a tricky subject for Farage lately, since it emerged that supporters donated for free an office that he lists as a significant running cost. He insists he has done nothing wrong, so I ask if he can give voters a guarantee that every penny he's received from the EU has been spent correctly.\par \par \uc2 "I can guarantee one thing. That I haven't done it for personal gain. But how I've spent my time and money, and whether I've spent it because I'm an MEP, or because I'm Ukip, I would suggest to you is a very grey area. It's a difficult divide. I've made no bones about it that I would use the wherewithal provided by the European parliament to go round Britain and campaign against Britain's membership of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . I think I'm just about within the rules. I think I've kept just the right side of the line. Albeit pushing right up to it, sure."\par \par \uc2 And if he has strayed over the line and broken the rules? He doesn't think it matters. "I mean, given the abuses for personal gain that have gone on with expenses in Westminster, I don't think the general public are that interested in whether I've strictly observed the rules on what is campaigning and what isn't. We always knew these criticisms would come at some point. If someone in Brussels wants to martyr me for that, then, well . . . well, they won't, they won't."\par \par \uc2 He told the Today programme last week that he would be happy to have his expenses independently audited, but he is now keen to correct this. "No, I didn't. I said if every other British MEP wants to then I would. I mean, I am not going to be one out of 73 that is held up as an example of all that is wrong with the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . After all, I've been saying that myself for years, so this is absolutely ludicrous."\par \par \uc2 The other charge levelled against Farage is that he can be a hot-headed bully, so I ask when he last raised his voice at a colleague. "Um, that's a very good question. I had some sharp words with somebody two days ago. I told him to sharpen his effing act up. He said to me today, thank you for that. But I very rarely lose my temper. You know, really lose my temper." What about a barky growl? "Oh, I do that quite regularly."\par \par \uc2 He is one of the jolliest politicians I've ever met - exuberantly self-deprecating ("Why would I take paternity leave? I'm absolutely useless!"), quick to laugh, great fun, and uncommonly at ease in his own skin. But I would guess that, when provoked, he can go off like a bomb. Interestingly, he says of the Clegg debates: "He really, really tried to dig me in the ribs in that second one, but I knew I was calm, I knew I was in control. I think if he'd gone down that line in the first debate, I might well have snapped. Which I would have enjoyed - but probably no one else would have."\par \par \uc2 The day after our meeting, Farage had to suspend one of the stars of Ukip's first ever party political broadcast, a council candidate, after racist tweets from his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account were exposed. When I interviewed Farage in January last year, he was still a maverick on the political margins, and for all his charisma, it was hard to see how he could protect himself from his colleagues' bigotry and battiness. I still can't work out whether what he's achieved since then says more about the failings of the Westminster class than it does about Farage's own acumen. But his apparent immunity to any amount of Ukip scandals is looking less like just good luck.\par \par \uc2 Then again, as he points out himself, he is a very lucky man. It's surprisingly easy to forget that on election day in 2010 Farage very nearly died in a plane crash, when a Ukip banner the light aircraft was towing became tangled in the tail fin. At the time it seemed almost like a bad joke - a metaphor for an eccentric political career nose-diving into oblivion - but not to Farage. "Well, it was horrible. Yeah. It's one of those things I still think about." He thought he was going to die. What went through his mind? "All sorts of things that shouldn't have done," he laughs. "I'm not going to tell you." Go on. "Well, I thought a bit about things I'd done well, things I'd done badly. I thought about all the different girlfriends I've had, you know, about different forks in the road at different times." Was he seized by regrets? "Well, we all have regrets in our life - but I'm married, you see," he laughs, "so I can't answer that."\par \par \uc2 He thought about phoning his wife. "But then I reasoned that probably that phone call would haunt them." If he had called, he would have said: "Sorry I've been such an appalling husband and a not very good father. But that wouldn't have helped. So I just sat there quietly. And then when the end comes, and you're careering towards the earth, there's almost a sense of resignation. Let's hope it's over quickly."\par \par \uc2 He came to rest upside down, his head two inches from the ground - "That was the difference between snapping my neck and not." Covered in fuel oil, he thought he was about to burn to death. "And that was terrible. And I thought, nobody will ever know I survived this crash. And then, after a few minutes, it hadn't caught fire, and I began to think it might be OK. But I couldn't breathe. And I thought, you know, all those years of smoking - if I get out of this I'll never touch another cigarette, I'll be a really good person. If I get out of this I'm going to live such a good life." And has he kept any of his promises? "No! None of them."\par \par \uc2 He thinks that since the crash, "I'm a little bit more aware of others than perhaps in my worst moments I would have been before." Awareness of others has never been his strong point, he chuckles softly. "I think it's been a weakness. But I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing otherwise. To do what I've done in this job, I think you have to lack self-awareness."\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage knows he's lucky, having narrowly escaped dying when a plane towing a Ukip banner crashed on election day 2010 Photographs: Richard Rayner for the Guardian; Neil Hall/INS\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140426ea4q0000t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw59\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal885\pichgoal600

The party must ready itself for a "blue\u8211\'20\'13on\u8211\'20\'13red" main offensive against Labour while also carrying out "blue\u8211\'20\'13on\u8211\'20\'13purple" raids into UK Independence Party territory on the Right flank.\par \par \uc2 Yet on both fields of combat the Prime Minister is convinced the same weapon can bring ultimate victory. He believes that, more than two decades after the calamity of the Black Wednesday currency crisis in September 1992, the Conservatives have at last regained their reputation as the only truly trustworthy custodians of economic wellbeing.\par \par \uc2 Tory hopes rest on voters recognising that Mr Cameron and Chancellor \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  have put the country back on the path to prosperity and steadily rising living standards. Party activists will argue on the doorsteps that putting Ed Miliband and Ed Balls into Downing Street can only mean a return to disastrous financial incompetence.\par \par \uc2 The strength of the Ukip threat was shown this week with the launch of their Euro election campaign. The anti\u8211\'20\'13Brussels party unveiled some provocative posters that powerfully appealed to concerns about the dangers of unlimited \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It is a message that will stick in voters' minds far longer than the latest embarrassment over Ukip members being caught out expressing unpleasant and outlandish views on the internet.\par \par \uc2 PRIVATELY Tory strategists admit that Nigel Farage's unequivocally anti\u8211\'20\'13Brussels rhetoric will be difficult to counter in the run\u8211\'20\'13up to the Euro elections and are braced for big Ukip gains on May 22.\par \par \uc2 "In the Euro election game Ukip can always play their joker," said one senior Tory source close to the campaign plans.\par \par \uc2 Yet Mr Cameron is understood to be optimistic that the Tories can swiftly win back "blue\u8211\'20\'13inclined Ukip voters" once the polls close.\par \par \uc2 He has ruled out any further tacking to the Right, arguing that the Tory record on tackling welfare dependency in particular is clear evidence that the party is championing core conservative principles of responsibility and self\u8211\'20\'13reliance under his leadership.\par \par \uc2 Any attempt to directly challenge Ukip on policy issues has also been discounted. Mr Cameron is understood to believe that his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg made a huge error in challenging Mr Farage to live television debates. Instead he believes the Tory success in turning around an economy devastated by the financial crash and Labour's crazed spending sprees will prove to be decisive.\par \par \uc2 "Ukip voters care about the economy too. They don't want to see Miliband and Balls mess it up," the Tory source said.\par \par \uc2 Tory aides noted that this week's YouGov poll predicts a thumping 27 per cent vote share for Ukip in the Euro elections but that figure falls to 12 per cent when voters are asked about whom they will back in the general election.\par \par \uc2 Other polls suggest the gap between Labour and the Tories is narrowing as the economy improves.\par \par \uc2 NOW the Tory leadership is striving to ensure that nothing distracts from the key economic message. Senior figures in Mr Cameron's inner circle admit that the party made a hash of the 2010 general election campaign that led to the hung parliament and the need for coalition.\par \par \uc2 Voters were confused by muddled slogans that simultaneously claimed the Conservative Party had been transformed into something zingy and new while also offering traditional financial sobriety to turn the economy around. Party chiefs insist those mistakes will not be made again.\par \par \uc2 Over the next 12 months Mr Cameron's team will relentlessly pound Mr Miliband and Mr Balls on the issue of economic competence and highlight their complicity in \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 's disastrous regime.\par \par \uc2 The aim is for that warning to scare voters away from either backing Labour or helping their cause with a protest vote to Ukip.\par \par \uc2 In Tory high command the belief is that economic credibility is a silver bullet that can slay both the red and purple foes.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140426ea4q0005g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour."\par \par \uc2 This sparked an attack from the Tories after it was revealed that the man is Dave O'Rourke, an actor from Dublin.\par \par \uc2 Tory MP Bob Neill said: "I think it is pretty hypocritical of Ukip. They always like to say 'we are not part of the political establishment', they like to claim they are the party of ordinary people.\par \par \uc2 "They are using a trick most other parties stopped using long ago, because they get found out doing it.\par \par \uc2 "As far as I am aware, we always use genuine people in our adverts." But Ukip director of communications Patrick O'Flynn insisted the use of actors was "totally standard practice".\par \par \uc2 He said: "The vast majority of people used in political poster campaigns are actors.\par \par \uc2 "It is nonsense for the Conservative Party to try to depict this as anything out of the ordinary.\par \par \uc2 "For example, the people depicted in the Tory 'You paid the taxes...' campaign under William Hague were actors.\par \par \uc2 "So Bob Neill needs to go and berate the Foreign Secretary if he really thinks there is anything wrong with this."\par \par \uc2 The row is the latest controversy to hit Ukip's campaign for the May 22 European elections.\par \par \uc2 Party member Andre Lampitt, who featured in an election broadcast, was found to have posted offensive messages about foreigners on the internet. He was suspended from the party and his views described as "repellent" by leader Nigel Farage.\par \par \uc2 Another Ukip member, David Challice, came under fire yesterday for past remarks about Muslims and women.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140426ea4q0003x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

Tory MP and former communities minister Bob Neill dubbed it "another example of Ukip being cynical and not being straight with voters".\par \par \uc2 Labour MP Mike Gapes said: "The level of hypocrisy with this poster would beggar belief from most political parties, but nothing surprises me with Ukip.\par \par \uc2 "It is part of an attempt to conceal their real politics, which is anti-foreigner."\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage's party hit back to brand the attacks "nonsense".\par \par \uc2 A Ukip spokesman said: "The vast majority of people used in political poster campaigns are actors."\par \par \uc2 The row is the third PR disaster for the anti-EU party's Euro election campaign. Previously it emerged that a female "voter" pictured in Ukip's manifesto was Mr Farage's events manager, 27-year-old Lizzy Vaid. And a star of a TV election broadcast on Wednesday, Andre Lampitt \u8212\'20\'14 also a party council candidate \u8212\'20\'14 was suspended for sending racist tweets.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday Ukip refused to suspend West Country activist David Challice after he mocked Islamic law in a local newspaper advert.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Mr Farage appeared to withdraw his offer to have his EU expenses independently audited, saying he would only do it if "every other British MEP wants to".\par \par \uc2 t.newtondunn@the-sun.co.uk The Sun Says \u8212\'20\'14 Page Eight\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140426ea4q000ud\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A wave of new arrivals from Eastern Europe could play a decisive role in the fate of the 300-year union between England and Scotland, pushing Alex Salmond's nationalists over the winning line in the independence referendum.\par \par \uc2 Ania Lewandowska, 29, a campaigner who works for Alyn Smith, the Scottish National Party MEP, has no doubt that many "new Scots" will vote "yes" in September's ballot. "Poles know that change can be for the better \u8212\'20\'14 they are not afraid of it," she said. "Of course, some are still undecided \u8212\'20\'14 that's true of any sector of Scottish society \u8212\'20\'14 but in my mind most Poles will decide yes."\par \par \uc2 About 55,000 Polish-born people lived in Scotland at the time of the 2011 census, and by the time of the referendum it is possible the population will have almost doubled. Maciej Wiczynski, an SNP supporter, has pooled information from local authorities and found that 30,000 Poles have registered to vote. He has still to receive data from Edinburgh, home to Scotland's largest Polish community.\par \par \uc2 Mr Wiczynski, a health worker, arrived in Scotland four years ago and was initially sceptical about independence. However, after researching the issue, he was won over.\par \par \uc2 "Money is not the issue," he said. "It is more to do with social justice. Westminster is not working for the people of Scotland. We are more centre-left."\par \par \uc2 Tomek Borkowy, 61, agreed. He is an actor and Edinburgh Fringe promoter who came to Britain in 1982, when he fled martial law in his country, and has lived in Scotland for the past 25 years. He likes that Scotland is small, and described the ease with which he was able to arrange a lunch meeting with John Swinney, the country's cabinet secretary for finance \u8212\'20\'14 "me, a foreigner, living in Edinburgh! Would that have happened if I had approached George Osborne? Absolutely not."\par \par \uc2 He added: "Small is beautiful, small is better government. This is now my country. I will vote for independence. Most Poles will. This is a no-brainer."\par \par \uc2 Pawel Nuckowski, 41, however, is one who will not. The film-maker, who has lived in Edinburgh for 18 months, said he was inclined to support the Yes cause, but was unlikely to vote. "How would Poles feel if British people moved in and decided on the future of my country?" he said.\par \par \uc2 Marcin Wilkolaski, who has a shop on Leith Walk selling Polish hams and pickles, took a dim view of the Yes campaign, saying: "Scotland and England have been together for centuries \u8212\'20\'14 that is very profitable for everyone."\par \par \uc2 Anecdotally, he may be pulling against the tide, but the Polish community remains too small to register in many opinion surveys. The numbers involved, and the transitory nature of a substantial part of the population, leave some inclined to dismiss the notion that Poles could influence the outcome of the referendum.\par \par \uc2 John Curtice, professor of politics at the \uc2 University of Strathclyde\uc2 , said that only 8 per cent of Scotland's population was born outside the UK and Ireland, adding: "EU citizens are less likely to be on the register \u8212\'20\'14 partly it's motivational, partly it's circumstantial. How much they engage in politics is debatable."\par \par \uc2 But if the polls keep narrowing, 10,000 votes could be decisive. Should the Yes campaign prevail, Mr Borkowy said, David Cameron would have only himself to blame for failing to offer Scotland "devolution max".\par \par \uc2 Like Mr Wiczynski, Mr Borkowy identified with "we" Scots. "We should escape," he said. "We have the possibilities now, an historic chance to change everything."\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140426ea4q000ko\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

But they have opposite meanings. As any fule, including Nigel Molesworth, kno, militate comes from the Latin miles, a soldier: one of the first words that Molesworth learnt in the days when Latin lessons were J Caesar military; before they became domestic. Events or people now militate against or with something or other. They conflict or are inconsistent with something else. 1838: "Everything may militate for, and nothing militate against, its authenticity."\par \par \uc2 Mitigate means to appease or mollify. The Latin mitis means soft or gentle. To mitigate is to render something or someone milder, less hostile. It is the older Latin \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  into the language. Thomas More's History of King Richard III, which was used by Shakespeare: "Where the King took displeasure, she would mitigate and appease his mind." It is a trick that the two similarsounding words mean the opposites. Distinguishing them is one of the many reasons for having a little Latin; like Shakespeare.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140426ea4q000et\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

He's also a gambler and dodgy businessman who disappears from his marriage in 1976. His unexpected and unexplained leaving profoundly affects, in different ways, the lives of five women: his wife Bambi, their three daughters and his lover Julie. When she too vanishes a decade later, it's generally thought she's gone to join him; years later her body is discovered, but no one is fingered. Even more years later, retired Baltimore cop Sandy Sanchez riffles through unsolved crimes, follows up vague leads and reopens old wounds. Lippman's insights into the psychology of family interactions are superbly convincing, and the gentle pace of the novel's first half leads to many twists and a clever, disturbing resolution.\par \par \uc2 A German officer in the Wehrmacht during the dying months of the Nazi occupation of Rome is not an obvious choice as a hero of crime fiction, but in Ben Pastor's A Dark Song of Blood, Major Martin Bora dispels all doubts. Handsome, unlucky in love, war-wounded, cultured and often insubordinate, Bora is ordered to solve three murders, including that of a cardinal. Occasionally supported by the uneasy Italian Inspector Sandro Guidi, Bora, dreaming of a war-free future, moves morosely among Italian society and the soon to be defeated German occupiers. Pastor writes with feeling and perception, and creates a wonderfully moody atmosphere. She deserves greater attention.\par \par \uc2 Chris Pavone's thriller debut, The Expats, promised well. His second, The Accident, fulfils that expectation. The story takes place in one day, in the early hours of which Isabel Reid, a fading New York liter-ary agent, receives the manuscript of a book by "Anonymous". It's a devastating expos\u233\'00\'E9 of a powerful media tycoon. Realising its potential, both financial and for her reputation, she limits knowledge of the book to a few people she trusts. But word gets around, one of her confidantes is murdered, and she spends the rest of the day and night fleeing from various interests trying to recover the book, if necessary by killing her. It's a breathless read.\par \par \uc2 Set in east London's Polish community, Anya Lipska's second novel, Death Can't Take a Joke, has a clever plot, interesting characters and believable knowledge of the edgy lives led by \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  halfpining for their old country. Janusz Kiszka is a slightly shady fixer and unofficial private detective, Natalie Kershaw a young DC just transferred to the murder squad and about to move in with her boyfriend. Murders and unexplained deaths merge, so that the two almost-friends find themselves co-operating to solve crimes with a Polish tinge.\par \par \uc2 Sherlock Holmes, Philip Marlowe and Lord Peter Wimsey have had them, with varying success. Hercule Poirot is getting one later this year. I refer to great fictional detectives revived by top crime writers of today. Now Margery Allingham's creation, Albert Campion, has acquired a good one \u8212\'20\'14 Mike Ripley, whose "Angel" series remains a high point in comic crime fiction.\par \par \uc2 Mr Campion's Farewell is listed as "completed" by him, but Ripley had only a few notes, left by Allingham's widower, to work from. The plot \u8212\'20\'14 set in a pretty English village harbouring assorted deaths and an array of dreadful secrets centering on the number nine \u8212\'20\'14 is suitably Allinghamian, and Ripley excels at presenting Campion, whose toff drawl and effete mannerisms hide an astute crime-solving brain.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140426ea4q000em\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

\par\par \uc2 News; Opinion Columns\par \b \uc2 'Our press is the world's best \u8212\'20\'14 it is fearless and without favour'\b0\par\par\uc2 Alice Thomson; Rachel Sylvester   \par \uc2 1,850 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 April 2014\par \uc2 The Times\par \uc2 T\par \uc2 3; National\par 34,35\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 SaJid Javid is relishing his new cabinet role, write Alice Thomson and Rachel Sylvester This week, Sajid Javid has been to the Matisse show at Tate Modern and visited the National Gallery, \uc2 Tate Britain\uc2 , \uc2 the British Museum\uc2 , the British Library and the Government Art Collection, as well as seeing Hamlet at the Globe Theatre to celebrate Shakespeare's birthday. His World Cup tickets are on the way and he drinks his tea from a Visit Britain mug. It's been a crash course in culture, media and sport for the new secretary of state. The son of a bus driver, whose father arrived in Britain from Pakistan with only \u163\'00\'A31 in his pocket, has had an extraordinary rise. A Muslim whose first language was Punjabi, he grew up in Rochdale and Bristol, spending much of his childhood with his four brothers in a two-bedroom flat above a shop.\par \par \uc2 His head teacher tried to ban him from taking maths O level but he insisted on sitting it, passed with flying colours, then made millions as a banker in New York before going into politics. After only two years as an MP he became economic secretary to the Treasury, before being promoted to the cabinet this month after the resignation of Maria Miller. Now he is regularly discussed as a possible future leader of the Conservative party.\par \par \uc2 When he was young, his only regular outing was to the library, where his mother, who had never been to school, would instruct her five sons to read for two hours. "Our parents understood that education was hugely important if their children were going to get anywhere. In many Asian families, they say: 'You must join a profession, be a doctor or an accountant.' My parents just said: 'You must get a good job.'" The culture secretary, 45, admits that he has never been to the opera and says the only ballet he has ever seen was at his children's school. He doesn't know The Luminaries or The Goldfinch, the latest Man Booker and Pulitzer prize-winning novels. The last fiction he read was Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy.\par \par \uc2 "As a young lad I didn't have the opportunity to go to the theatre, opera or ballet, it wasn't even on my radar because it was a real treat just to go to the cinema," he says. "That was a money thing ... Now, there is not much time outside work and what I do get is very precious, like for any working parent. I have four kids and a lot of the choices are dictated by them. The weekend before I got promoted I went to see War Horse with my daughter but Frozen is often what they want to see."\par \par \uc2 Although he has been criticised by the arts establishment for his lack of expertise, he says: "There are some people who think that only Picasso can be culture secretary ... but my cultural background is more like the 90 per cent than the 10 per cent of the population."\par \par \uc2 Most government departments would be thrilled to have this Tory rising star, who showed sure-footedness and intelligence at the Treasury, in charge. "In my old job I travelled the world and I have seen for myself in China, Brazil and India just how important our culture is," he says. He is setting up an \u163\'00\'A318 million cultural exports fund to promote British theatre, art and film abroad. "If more people in China are going to see War Horse, Sherlock and Harry Potter, they will gain an understanding of Britishness and the best of our values and beliefs. We need this sector to grow."\par \par \uc2 Personally, he prefers David Hockney to Damien Hirst and LS Lowry to Tracey Emin, but he doesn't want to meddle. "I appreciate there can be art I don't enjoy but others do," he says. "It is not my job to pick winners. History will decide what is great and the population what is popular but my role is to make sure creativity can thrive."\par \par \uc2 Schools must promote the arts, he insists. "Art and design should be a key part of education ... Our authors, directors and actors are known around the world, but we can't take that for granted. Even though we have something so successful, we will have to run to stand still."\par \par \uc2 Museums and galleries will stay free as long as he is culture secretary. "When I was 11, I went to the Natural History Museum with the school and we had to pay for the whole trip, which was very expensive, so widening access to the arts is important to me and free access to museums is a huge part of it."\par \par \uc2 The future regulation of newspapers may be the contentious part of his brief and on this Mr Javid appears to be striking a different tone from his predecessor. "The press is hugely important and freedom of speech is a cornerstone of our democracy," he says. "I'm proud of the press ... Notwithstanding the fact that any industry has its bad apples, I think our press is the best in the world. It is fearless without favour."\par \par \uc2 After the phone-hacking scandal there was, he says, general agreement that \uc2 the Press Complaints Commission\uc2  "wasn't really working and something had to be changed". He doesn't want another showdown. "It is now a decision for the press what they want to do next. I don't see any further role for government in this but the most important thing has got to be that the press is respected for the role they've played. Our country has benefited hugely over the ages from having a press that is vibrant and fearless."\par \par \uc2 The newspapers were, in his view, justified in pursuing Mrs Miller over her expenses. "I think one of the important roles of the press is to hold public officials to account and Maria herself recognised that she made mistakes ... As long as they are presenting facts I think that is perfectly healthy."\par \par \uc2 The internet is his greater concern. He intends to legislate by the autumn to force people accessing online pornography to prove that they are over 18. "I've got three girls and a boy, aged five to 14, and I do worry about it. Just as you restrict access to this kind of material in newsagents, or the sale of alcohol to children, it's legitimate for governments to be involved."\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid's eldest daughter is called Sophia, the name his mother would "have given him had he been a girl. "My parents were desperate to have a daughter," he says. "They kept going and had five boys."\par \par \uc2 When he was growing up, it was "brothers looking after each other" while parents were out at work. His father, who had a job in a cotton mill, as well as on the buses, was called "Mr Night and Day" by colleagues. After years living in Britain, he gave up his Pakistani nationality.\par \par \uc2 "This was his country, this was his home. It wasn't a temporary stop, it was the future for him and his family," the minister says. "There were lots of things about Britain \u8212\'20\'14 the culture, the sport \u8212\'20\'14 that were hugely important to him. He was very proud of being British."\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid feels the same. "As soon as I was sent to school, all my experiences were the same as any other British child. The end result is that I feel as British as any man on the street."\par \par \uc2 Margaret Thatcher convinced his father, who had always voted Labour until 1979, that she was "a woman who would sort the country out". The family is now Tory and the culture secretary hangs a picture of Thatcher over his desk. Now, though, the Conservative party is struggling to attract ethnic-minority voters. "A lot of polling has suggested there's an issue," Mr Javid admits. "If I had to pick one thing that explains it, it would be the speech that was made the year before I was born by Enoch Powell. That is not the Tory party, it wasn't even the Tory party then."\par \par \uc2 He thinks "it takes time" to change perceptions. "Engagement [with ethnic-minority communities] is a big part of it, listening to concerns, turning up at events and talking to people. In the past the Conservatives haven't done as good a job at that as Labour. We can do more."\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  policy is not in his view the problem. "In fact concerns over excessive \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  in Britain are there equally among people from ethnic-minority backgrounds."\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  infuriated some this Easter when he suggested that Britain was a Christian country but Mr Javid, whose wife is a churchgoer, says: "I agree with the prime minister. Clearly our history and our culture are Christian. That's impacted everything from how we run our country to the festivals we have. I think it's something we should be proud of, and a lot of people of other faiths would respect that as well."\par \par \uc2 He is appalled by the idea that Islamic extremists may have infiltrated some schools in Birmingham, demanding that girls sit at the back in class. "It's totally unacceptable ... to have segregated classes. Michael Gove is right to take this really seriously, send in an inspector and get to the truth because if this kind of thing is really going on then we've got to deal with it now."\par \par \uc2 Despite the number of Old Etonians in the cabinet, this comprehensive schoolboy feels that Westminster is meritocratic. "I can't say I've felt any social or racial discrimination in politics," he says. So does he think that Britain could have a Muslim prime minister? "We had the first woman prime minister. In this country, anything is possible."

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The leading contender for the \uc2 European Union\uc2 's top job has pledged to work for a "fair deal for Britain" in a boost for \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's plan to negotiate looser membership terms.\par \par \uc2 Jean-Claude Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg, said that he would make keeping Britain in the 28-member club one of his top priorities if he became president of the European Commission. His promise will be regarded by Downing Street as a significant concession because Mr Juncker is regarded as an arch-federalist who has previously warned that Britain will not be allowed to rewrite EU rules.\par \par \uc2 "No reasonable politician can ignore the fact that, during the next five years, we will have to find solutions for the political concerns of the UK," Mr Juncker told a press conference in Brussels. "We have to do this to keep the UK in the EU. As commission president, I will work for a fair deal with Britain."\par \par \uc2 Mr Juncker, 59, is the leading candidate of Europe's centre-right parties for the top job when the successor to \uc2 Jos\u233\'00\'E9 Manuel Barroso\uc2  is selected in the autumn, but he has not been endorsed by the Conservative party in Britain. He was previously regarded as hostile to Mr Cameron, who pulled his MEPs out of the main European conservative group five years ago in protest at its commitment to building a federal Europe. Mr Juncker's change of tone towards Britain will be seen a sign of the success of Mr Cameron's policy of renegotiating a new deal on EU membership before holding a referendum on EU membership in 2017. The prime minister has said that his key demands include tighter \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rules, new powers for national parliaments to change EU law and abolishing the principle of "ever closer union".\par \par \uc2 "I will be ready to talk to him about these demands in a fair and reasonable manner," Mr Juncker said, in contrast to his earlier dismissal of fundamental changes. In return for "a deal that accepts the specificities of the UK", Britain will need to allow the 18 eurozone countries to integrate further. "The other EU countries will have to accept that the UK will never participate in the euro, even if we may regret this ... and it will stay outside new EU institutions, such as the European Public Prosecutor's Office," he said. "My red line in such talks would be the integrity of the single market and its four freedoms", including freedom of movement. Mr Juncker's mood of compromise reflected a more accommodating tone in leading EU capitals including Warsaw, where Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, told The Times: "We are perfectly willing to help you fix some of the problems of the EU."\par \par \uc2 Mr Juncker is campaigning across the EU during the European parliament election campaign but has not scheduled any meetings in Britain.\par \par \uc2 His case to become the next commission president will be strengthened if the centre-right parties win the most MEPs in the voting on May 22 and May 25.\par \par \uc2 Europe's centre-left parties have nominated Martin Schulz, the German president of the European parliament, as their top candidate.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage will not allow an independent auditor to examine how he uses \uc2 European Union\uc2  funds but admitted yesterday that he could not guarantee that every penny had been spent correctly.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage appeared to make the offer during a BBC radio interview last week after The Times revealed allegations that he had misused almost \u163\'00\'A360,000 in European parliamentary allowances meant to fund the upkeep of an office since mid-2009.\par \par \uc2 Asked if he would allow an independent accountant to examine his books, Mr Farage told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "If that would settle the argument of course I would."\par \par \uc2 However, in an interview with The Guardian yesterday he denied that he had ever accepted the suggestion.\par \par \uc2 "I said if every other British MEP wants to, then I would," he said. "I mean, I am not going to be one out of 73 that is held up as an example of all that is wrong with the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . I've been saying that myself for years, so this is absolutely ludicrous. If all 73 people want to go on to a new regime then of course I'll do it, but to be singled out in this way is frankly ridiculous."\par \par \uc2 His comments came as the party's European election campaign suffered a further setback when it emerged that a poster accusing EU workers of taking British jobs featured an Irish actor who had migrated to the UK.\par \par \uc2 The fresh embarrassment came hours after a star of the party's televised election broadcast was suspended for a series of "repellent" racist tweets.\par \par \uc2 Andre Lampitt, who will still appear on ballot papers next month as a Ukip local election candidate in Merton, south London, had described Muslims as animals and said that black Africans should be left to "kill themselves".\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage has told this newspaper that the "missing" funds, which he had claimed in an online transparency report had been spent on utilties, insurance and business rates for a small constituency office near Bognor Regis, had in fact been spent "campaigning against British membership of the EU".\par \par \uc2 This appears to be in breach of EU rules which prohibit using the money for party political purposes.\par \par \uc2 Asked by The Guardian whether he could guarantee that every penny had been spent correctly, Mr Farage replied: "I can guarantee one thing; that I haven't done it for personal gain. But how I've spent my time and money, and whether I've spent it because I'm an MEP, or because I'm Ukip, I would suggest to you is a very grey area."\par \par \uc2 He continued: "It's a difficult divide.\par \par \uc2 I've made no bones about it that I would use the wherewithal provided by the European parliament to go round Britain and campaign against Britain's membership of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . I think I'm just about within the rules. I think I've kept just the right side of the line, albeit pushing right up to it, sure."\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the party's \u163\'00\'A31.5 million nationwide poster campaign before the European election next month was ridiculed for using an Irish actor as the face of an anti-EU \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  campaign. In one, a builder in a highvisibility jacket and hard hat is shown begging. The poster has the slogan: "EU policy at work. British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour."\par \par \uc2 It emerged that the "builder" was Dave O'Rourke, an Irish actor who was born in Dublin and lives in Edinburgh.\par \par \uc2 The revelation was particularly embarrassing because Mr Farage had said that the party used genuine supporters rather than actors in campaign material. He made the comments on Wednesday after the party was criticised for presenting a Ukip staff member, Lizzy Vaid, as an ordinary voter from Devon in a campaign brochure.\par \par \uc2 Ukip decided to stand by David Challice, its communications manager and a council election candidate, yesterday after it was revealed that he had suggested that "cash-strapped Muslims" should get multiple wives as a "money spinner" so they can claim large benefit payments. Mr Challice, who made the suggestion in an advert he placed in his local newspaper in 2009, had made online postings last year in which he said that women shouldn't go to work.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman said that the comments were meant as a joke, and added: "Ukip is not a party that believes in public debate and conversation being stifled by an obsession with political correctness."\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140426ea4q000c7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 David Axelrod worked wonders for Obama \u8212\'20\'14 now he is over here and hoping to win again, reports David Taylor\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband's new American election guru will focus mercilessly on the Labour leader's weaknesses as one of his first acts as he tries to replicate the success of the Obama campaigns, according to US analysts.\par \par \uc2 David Axelrod, hired for his expertise in crafting a sharp message and developing an election strategy, will place Mr Miliband at the core of a compelling personal and political narrative.\par \par \uc2 First, however, he is likely to take a leaf out of the Obama campaign playbook and confront Mr Miliband's image problem: voter perception that the Labour leader is a "weird" north Londoner who stole the Labour leadership from his brother.\par \par \uc2 At the outset of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's first presidential run, Mr Axelrod created mock advertisements attacking his own candidate. He then played them to focus groups, using their reactions to ready his own response for the inevitable Republican attacks.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  should also prepare for an aggressive onslaught from a man who honed his skills on advertising campaigns in the tough world of Chicago politics and has admitted that he occasionally reaches for the "bloody dagger". The recruitment of Mr Axelrod and a team from his former Chicago firm AKPD means that for the first time each of the three main parties is going into next year's general election with a foreign strategic mastermind.\par \par \uc2 Ed Rollins, who was Ronald Reagan's campaign director in the 1984 presidential race, cites Mr Axelrod as a formidable opponent, once naming him in a list of "Guys I never want to see lobbing grenades against me again".\par \par \uc2 The pair clashed in congressional races in the 80s and Mr Rollins recognised him as "a superb messaging guy" with the ability to see the big picture.\par \par \uc2 He said that Tory opponents should look at the methodology of Mr Axelrod to see some of the strategies he was likely to stick to: his obsession with the power of narrative, turning the candidate's biography into a compelling story; and anticipating what is coming at his campaign and having a counter-plan ready.\par \par \uc2 "You figure out what the strengths are and you compensate for the weaknesses. The most important thing is don't delude yourself, don't think those things aren't going to be raised and raised effectively by the other side," Mr Rollins said.\par \par \uc2 Some who have worked closely with Mr Axelrod bill him as an idealist with a romantic view about the nobility of politics \u8212\'20\'14 his formative moment came as a five-year-old when he sat on a post box and saw JFK move a crowd in New York.\par \par \uc2 Joe McLean, a founding member of the Obama leadership team when he ran for the Senate, said: "He can be very tough in campaigns, but he's a real straight arrow."\par \par \uc2 According to a poll this month, 41 per cent think Ed Miliband is "weird" or "very weird", but Mr McLean said: "Every character trait that can be perceived as a negative also has a positive side \u8212\'20\'14 the fact that he is awkward looking can be turned into an everyman familiarity. Nobody is better than David in looking at the raw material and finding the right way to showcase the strengths of the individual and the rightness of the cause and the policy."\par \par \uc2 Mr Axelrod admits that he is not above contributing to what he calls the atmosphere of cynicism. "I try to fight that," he said in 2008. "I can't say I'm totally blameless.

For years, we have been happily sending out thousands of citizens to start a new life in Spain \u8211\'20\'13 about 760,000 sun-seekers have moved there since 1995. All of a sudden, though, the economic sun has gone behind the clouds and our bucket-and-spade brigades are withdrawing at an alarming rate. According to official figures, some\u160\'00\'A090,000 of us have forsaken the costas and returned to these shores.\par \par \uc2 The news has sent the nation rushing to our atlases to \uc2 seek\uc2  out new spots in which to settle. It\u8217\'20\'19s estimated that between 4.5 and 4.7\u160\'00\'A0million British citizens live abroad for at least part of the year.\par \par \uc2 Question is, when the world is your oyster, how do you find a place to live that is a genuine pearl?

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The three main parties have all hired foreign strategists to help to define their election campaigns. Not even the best can change political facts\par \par \uc2 One of the ironies of a general election campaign in which \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is bound to feature heavily is that the three main party strategists are all from overseas. Labour has just signed David Axelrod, the American political veteran who planned \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's successful bid for the White House. The Conservative campaign is being overseen by Lynton Crosby, the hard man of Australian politics who helped keep Boris Johnson in City Hall. The Liberal Democrats rely heavily for strategic advice on the polling wisdom of the South African Ryan Coetzee.\par \par \uc2 Although it is good to put a face to the campaigns of the main parties, it is important not to make a fetish of the ability of foreign recruits to change the weather. Some political facts are unavoidable and strategy is, as the Clinton aide James Carville memorably phrased it, no more than "putting lipstick on a pig".\par \par \uc2 No expensive foreign import into Conservative party central office can alter the fact that \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  struggles to make headway in the vital electoral plains of the north of England. The Tories still have a serious blue-collar problem that is also an urban problem. Mr Crosby has to devise a way to achieve the unprecedented feat of adding votes for a governing party that has been forced to cut public spending. Austerity has been necessary and successful but it is never popular. He will also have to solve the central strategic conundrum for Conservative electoral prospects, which is how to win back voters tempted by Ukip without alienating the floating centrist voters that the party also needs to command a clear win.\par \par \uc2 By the same token, Mr Axelrod is too wise and experienced to fool himself that he can wish away the poor ratings that the Labour leader Ed Miliband is enduring. He joins Labour just at the moment that the argument on which it has rested its claim to office \u8212\'20\'14 that Labour is the party to fix the cost of living crisis \u8212\'20\'14 is starting to run aground now that average wages are at last running higher than inflation. Mr Axelrod inherits the stubborn fact that Labour, rather than the Conservatives, still takes most of the blame for austerity for being in charge when the economy tanked.\par \par \uc2 The strategic position of the Liberal Democrat party is even more parlous. Having chosen to enter a coalition with the Conservatives, the Lib Dems can no longer claim to be either the party of protest or a party of the left. The choices that government imposes on a leader \u8212\'20\'14 such as abandoning a foolish promise to abolish tuition fees \u8212\'20\'14 have made a pariah of their leader, Nick Clegg. The party is languishing on a single-figure percentage of the vote with no obvious route to recovery.\par \par \uc2 The strategic dilemmas all point to the fact that in politics negative campaigning is easier than positive. A party may be divided about what it stands for but it will always be united about what it is against \u8212\'20\'14 it is against the other parties. Mr Axelrod has been hired for his ability to sharpen a message. Mr Crosby is no shrinking violet, either, as his brutal destruction of Ken Livingstone in the London mayoral contest showed. Although it might be an exaggeration to say that 2015 will be the most negative election campaign yet \u8212\'20\'14 the Tories in 2005 and Labour in 2010 both fought quite dirty \u8212\'20\'14 the electorate will have some vivid descriptions of the shortcomings of all parties to look forward to.\par \par \uc2 That said, voters are not stupid. All three of the political strategists are experienced enough to know that a message works only if it connects with a truth. Political strategists do not create the truth; they can only sharpen it. The central truth for 2015 will be whether the Conservatives can take enough of the credit for a recovering economy to ensure victory. Conversely, it will be whether the fear of Labour ruining that recovery is so strong that it ensures defeat.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140426ea4q0001h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NEWS\par \b \uc2 Nigel versus the North: a week on tour with Ukip\b0\par\par\uc2 By Michael Deacon Parliamentary Sketchwriter   \par \uc2 1,627 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 April 2014\par 08:00\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage hits the campaign trail to persuade the north of England that Ukip, not Labour, is the party of the working class \u8211\'20\'13 while protesters try to sabotage his tour\par \par \uc2 If I had to pick one moment that summed up Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s tour of northern England, it would be this. It was Wednesday night in Gateshead, and, sporting the leer of satisfaction that must haunt \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s dreams, Nigel Farage had just sauntered on stage at Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s largest ever public meeting, to the idolatrous acclaim of more than 1,000 supporters. Finally the applause died down. He opened his mouth to speak.\par \par \uc2 It was at this point that two young men in the audience stood up, and, to the tune of the Conga, began chanting, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152350694447528"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 “F--- off back to Toad Hall! F--- off back to Toad Hall! Na, na, na, na – hey! Na, na, na, na – hey! F--- off back to Toad Hall…”}}}\par \par \uc2 As politely as he could manage, Mr Farage declined their invitation, and the two men \u8211\'20\'13 still merrily chanting \u8211\'20\'13 were thrown out. Whereupon, presumably, they were congratulated by the 100-odd anti-Ukip protesters \u8211\'20\'13 or, to quote Mr Farage, \u8220\'20\'1Cherberts\u8221\'20\'1D \u8211\'20\'13 gathered outside the venue. (Banners: \u8220\'20\'1CMigrants Welcome, Bigots Aren\u8217\'20\'19t\u8221\'20\'1D; \u8220\'20\'1CU-Prick\u8221\'20\'1D; and a caricature of Mr Farage, accompanied by a speech bubble that read, \u8220\'20\'1CI represent the interests of the ruling class\u8221\'20\'1D.)\par \par \uc2 Well, it was never going to be easy. In an effort to dispel the impression that Ukip is merely a party of south-east England, supported by Tories who find the Tories insufficiently Tory, Mr Farage spent this week campaigning in the north. He walked the streets, made speeches, gave endless interviews. Labour, he kept declaring, had \u8220\'20\'1Cbetrayed\u8221\'20\'1D the northern working class \u8211\'20\'13 and, at the European elections next month, the northern working class could get its own back by voting Ukip. \u8220\'20\'1CThis Labour party, they have turned their backs on you,\u8221\'20\'1D he told Gateshead. \u8220\'20\'1CYou are no longer represented by them.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The question was: could Gateshead be represented by a Thatcherite public schoolboy from Kent?\par \par \uc2 The tour started on Tuesday in Sheffield, where Mr Farage unveiled {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10779971/Nigel-Farage-launches-Ukip-European-election-campaign-in-Sheffield.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Ukip’s strikingly blunt new billboards}}}\uc2  (\u8220\'20\'1C26 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?\u8221\'20\'1D). Then it was off to a hotel conference room for the first of the party\u8217\'20\'19s nightly public meetings. On the way in, attendees were invited to enter a prize draw. On offer: a holiday.\par \par \uc2 To Brussels.\par \par \uc2 The protesters outside (placards: \u8220\'20\'1CUkip Go Home\u8221\'20\'1D) were comfortably outnumbered by the 600 admirers in the audience. I glanced around the room. Roughly 50:50, men and women; mostly but certainly not all middle-aged and above. The only non-white face I spotted was on stage, and belonged to Amjad Bashir, Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s spokesman for small business. (The next day, on the campaign trail, a journalist asked Mr Farage whether Ukip was racist. Mr Farage chuckled tolerantly. \u8220\'20\'1CI mean, frankly,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, shaking his head, \u8220\'20\'1Cyou\u8217\'20\'19ve only got to look at\u8230\'20\'26 where\u8217\'20\'19s Amjad?\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Bashir was at that moment in the nearby florist\u8217\'20\'19s, dutifully paying for the six red roses Mr Farage had just bought to mark St George\u8217\'20\'19s Day.)\par \par \uc2 The Sheffield speech went down a storm. Even Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s most disgusted critic would have to concede that he\u8217\'20\'19s an exceptional performer on stage, embarrassingly superior to the leaders of the three main parties. So convincing an orator is he that people actually nod agreement when he rages against \u8220\'20\'1Cthe political class\u8221\'20\'1D for having \u8220\'20\'1Call gone to the same handful of schools\u8221\'20\'1D. No one so much as raises a hand to remind Mr Farage that he himself attended Dulwich College, a member of the elite \u8220\'20\'1CEton Group\u8221\'20\'1D of England\u8217\'20\'19s poshest independent schools, and that his fellow alumni include \uc2 Peter Lilley\uc2  (Con, Hitchin & Harpenden), Philip Hollobone (Con, Kettering), Chris Mole (Lab, Ipswich) and \uc2 John Spellar\uc2  (Lab, Warley).\par \par \uc2 Ukip rallies are always far livelier than those of other parties: they seethe with a kind of angry energy, a furious optimism. \u8220\'20\'1CI didn\u8217\'20\'19t know there were so many fruitcakes in Sheffield!\u8221\'20\'1D honked Mr Farage. The room guffawed. The night finished with a Q&A session. One man was thrown out, after refusing to stop shouting out hostile questions about the party\u8217\'20\'19s \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy.\par \par \uc2 The next day, Mr Farage was due to visit the town of Yarm, Stockton-on-Tees. Awaiting his arrival, I spent an entertaining 10 minutes outside the bank watching a local man subject three unhappy-looking Ukip officials to interrogations of near-Paxmanlike aggression. I wish I could convey in print his gasp of appalled glee when a Ukip candidate proved unable to tell him how many EU migrants work in Britain. \u8220\'20\'1CDay by day it goes up,\u8221\'20\'1D offered the Ukip candidate, falteringly. \u8220\'20\'1CYou can\u8217\'20\'19t say it goes up if you don\u8217\'20\'19t know the numbers!\u8221\'20\'1D hooted Paxman.\par \par \uc2 Sadly, Paxman had gone by the time Mr Farage pulled up in his battle bus (sign on window: \u8220\'20\'1CJoin the People\u8217\'20\'19s Army Tour\u8221\'20\'1D). The Ukip leader spent 40 minutes strolling round town amid a swarm of journalists. Perhaps the swarm put locals off; at any rate, in all that time I saw him speak to just two of them. One was a man in a vest with a shaven head and murky tattoos. \u8220\'20\'1CNever voted in me life before, but I\u8217\'20\'19m voting for you,\u8221\'20\'1D he informed Mr Farage. A beaming Mr Farage asked why. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is not our country no more,\u8221\'20\'1D replied the man, darkly.\par \par \uc2 I had slightly better luck than the Ukip leader, and spoke to another couple of supporters. \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t know anybody in Middlesbrough who\u8217\'20\'19s not going to vote for him,\u8221\'20\'1D declared one man stoutly. (On the other hand, a Newcastle-born taxi driver told me Ukip had no chance, because \u8220\'20\'1CLabour could start World War Three and everyone here would still vote for them\u8221\'20\'1D. Except, that is, for the taxi driver himself, who was a lifelong Tory. A Geordie Tory! This was not, he confided, a fact that he advertised willy-nilly.)\par \par \uc2 Next day\u8217\'20\'19s stop: Knutsford, a well-heeled Cheshire town best-known as the inspiration for Cranford. It didn\u8217\'20\'19t look as though it could be easily classified among the \u8220\'20\'1CLabour heartlands\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Farage had so noisily set his sights on. The local MP is one G Osborne. Still, explained the Ukip leader, it was important \u8220\'20\'1Cto remind ourselves that there are some Tories who are thinking about voting Ukip as well\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage alighted from his battle bus, stopped for a chat with a supporter out walking a spectacularly bouffanted poodle, then strode straight into the nearest pub.\par \par \uc2 When he finally emerged, one pint and a dozen interviews later, he found the people of Knutsford almost universally adoring. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re ardent supporters,\u8221\'20\'1D a middle-aged couple informed him sternly. After another half-hour of adulation and handshakes, he was chauffeured away. Mere minutes, coincidentally, before news broke that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10785963/Ukip-posterboy-suspended-after-claiming-Miliband-not-British.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Andre Lampitt, a Ukip candidate, had been suspended by the party for allegedly sending racist tweets}}}\uc2  . Earlier in the afternoon, I suddenly recalled, Mr Farage had told me that \u8220\'20\'1Crevolutionary socialists\u8221\'20\'1D were trying to \u8220\'20\'1Cwhip stories that we\u8217\'20\'19re somehow a racist party\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Goodness. These revolutionary socialists work quickly.\par \par \uc2 That night\u8217\'20\'19s Ukip rally was held in Manchester. Although Mr Lampitt\u8217\'20\'19s name was all over the news, it received no mention at the rally. Mr Farage did, though, announce that Ukip could be proud of having turned \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  into \u8220\'20\'1Ca mature and respectable debate\u8221\'20\'1D. I googled Mr Lampitt\u8217\'20\'19s tweets. \u8220\'20\'1CInner peace will come when Aids does what it should and reduce African density.\u8221\'20\'1D Well, I suppose that one was more about population growth than \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Louise Bours, a Ukip councillor, reassured the audience that \u8220\'20\'1Cthe only time that people call you racist is when they\u8217\'20\'19ve got nothing else to say. They\u8217\'20\'19ve lost the argument. They have to insult us. It\u8217\'20\'19s like playground bullying.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 I hope Mr Lampitt doesn\u8217\'20\'19t feel he\u8217\'20\'19s been bullied.\par \par \uc2 It had been a long week, for me as much as for Mr Farage. I\u8217\'20\'19d been trailing him all across the north for days, and I fear my constant presence may have grown rather wearing. On Thursday afternoon he slipped out of the back of a pub for a cigarette and what looked like a tense conversation with an assistant. \u8220\'20\'1CHe\u8217\'20\'19s waiting for something to happen,\u8221\'20\'1D I heard her mutter to him. I realised who they were talking about, just before they realised that the subject of their exchange was eavesdropping on it.\par \par \uc2 Instantly Mr Farage exploded into blokeish bonhomie. \u8220\'20\'1CYou\u8217\'20\'19re turning into a bloody stalker, ha ha!\u8221\'20\'1D he chortled, Farageishly.

From what I saw, they can certainly win plenty of votes there \u8211\'20\'13 from Labour, from the Tories, from people who\u8217\'20\'19ve never voted. On the other hand, the northerners who don\u8217\'20\'19t like them really don\u8217\'20\'19t like them; the anti-Ukip animus is felt more intensely the farther north you go. And there must be at least some of these haters who aren\u8217\'20\'19t revolutionary socialists.\par \par \uc2 In Gateshead, the \u8220\'20\'1CToad Hall\u8221\'20\'1D distraction behind him, Mr Farage told his audience that Ukip \u8220\'20\'1Cwill beat the Labour party in their heartlands\u8221\'20\'1D and that \u8220\'20\'1Cthe days of mockery of Ukip are over\u8221\'20\'1D. The first prediction may come true, in future years if not next month. The second may be optimistic.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140426ea4q000e5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 IT IS called Mount Pleasant estate - but the name could not be further from the reality of those who have to live here.\par \par \uc2 For this sprawling, dilapidated industrial park in a deprived corner of London was not built for human habitation.\par \par \uc2 But the rat-infested warren of crumbling Victorian buildings is home to desperate people living in makeshift lodgings more akin to a Third World slum.\par \par \uc2 It is part of a worrying new phenomenon in London and the Home Counties, whereby commercial buildings, such as warehouses, factories, offices and garages, are shoddily converted and rented out as residential lets.\par \par \uc2 These illegal 'hidden homes' are unfit for purpose, with whole families, mainly \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , cramped into tiny rooms without heating or proper sanitation.\par \par \uc2 They are unregulated, unsafe and, as a result of being poorly wired for electricity, have caused more than 30 fires in the past nine months, which claimed two lives.\par \par \uc2 London Fire Brigade has warned of the dangers while councils struggle to cope with their emergence.\par \par \uc2 The situation in Mount Pleasant, in the North-West London borough of Brent, only came to light when the emergency services responded to a small fire and found up to 100 people living in appalling conditions.\par \par \uc2 Most have now been evicted but around 30 - mostly \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from Eastern Europe or Asia - remain, with just one bathroom and mould-covered kitchen, between all of them.\par \par \uc2 One 28-year-old Indian man, who did not want to reveal his real name for fear of reprisals, has lived there for 18 months and pays \u163\'00\'A3600 a month in rent. His only heat is from a gas hob ring and light from a torch or candle. He said: 'It is like a ghetto.'\par \par \uc2 Unemployed Romanian handyman Peter and girlfriend Anya, both 25, share a tiny room for \u163\'00\'A3400 a month and also have no power or heating.\par \par \uc2 Samir Fertal, 38, who owns a garage on the estate, said he was fighting a constant battle against rats and rubbish.\par \par \uc2 Other authorities with the problem include Slough, in Berkshire, Newham in East London and Ealing in West London. Many of the buildings have been sub-let many times with rent being paid in cash, making it difficult to trace who is accountable.\par \par \uc2 Landlords who are found often exploit a loophole by claiming they are renting to relatives. Last month \uc2 Harrow Council\uc2 , in North-West London, chartered a plane with thermal imaging, uncovering four times more 'suspicious' outbuildings than expected.\par \par \uc2 Housing minister Kris Hopkins said \u163\'00\'A36million had been made available to local authorities to 'root out the cowboys' and 950 illegal and overcrowded commercial properties had been uncovered as a result.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140425ea4q00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 TUESDAY: Ukip launched its posters displaying a giant pointing finger with the slogan: '26 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?' Critics branded the poster racist and warned it was scaremongering about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 WEDNESDAY: Nigel Farage was left embarrassed after it emerged a woman portrayed as a Ukip voter in Devon was actually his assistant Lizzy Vaid. The leader was also left squirming after he was asked by the BBC whether his German wife, who works for him, had 'stolen' a British job.\par \par \uc2 THURSDAY: It emerges that council candidate Andre Lampitt, a builder who featured in a party election broadcast, had tweeted a string of controversial messages about Islam, slavery and Africa. He was suspended after declaring that Ed Miliband was 'not a real Brit' and suggesting people should 'get over' slavery.\par \par \uc2 FRIDAY: David Challice, a leading party activist in the South West, is exposed for posting sexist comments about working women and for placing an advertisement advising 'cash-strapped' Muslims of a 'potential moneyspinner' - to take multiple wives for benefits. It is also revealed that the hard-up 'British builder' who had complained of losing work to cheaper EU labour was actually Irish actor Dave O'Rourke.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140425ea4q0001c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 POLISH INVASION THAT'S SAVED MY HOME TOWN\b0\par\par\uc2 2,456 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 April 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 30\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 An influx of 25,000 Poles has left Southampton's schools full to bursting \u8212\'20\'14 with some locals feeling pushed out. But BARBARA DAVIES, who grew up there, found there's another side to the story\par \par \uc2 BY BARBARA DAVIES\par \par \uc2 SHELVES in the Malinka delicatessen groan beneath piles of pickled vegetables, fish, rye bread and canned meats. A mother with a baby in a pram jokes with the dark-haired shop assistant as she points towards the thin, rusty-coloured kabanos sausages in the chiller cabinet.\par \par \uc2 It is impossible to know exactly what she is ordering because the two women are speaking quickly, quietly \u8212\'20\'14 and in Polish. So are another shop assistant and the other customers, a young blond couple with a baby and an elderly woman with a headscarf, trailing a shopping trolley behind her.\par \par \uc2 Step outside the shop and there are two Polish hairdressers, one called Ana, the other Aga, a Polish newsagent, several Polish supermarkets, Polish off-licences, car mechanics and translation services.\par \par \uc2 Yet this isn't a boulevard in Krakow, but Southampton's Shirley Road.\par \par \uc2 Here, in the city of my birth, it occurs to me for a moment that I am now the stranger \u8212\'20\'14 excluded by language and culture. Certainly, the Southampton of my childhood has altered beyond recognition.\par \par \uc2 Nearly ten years have passed since Poland joined the EU in May 2004, allowing workers to migrate here in search of work. Southampton now has more Polish inhabitants than any other city outside London.\par \par \uc2 Most recent figures show that there are now 25,000 Poles living in the city. With a population of around 240,000, that means more than one in ten is Polish.\par \par \uc2 Polish roots in the city stretch back to the end of World War II when Polish servicemen settled here \u8212\'20\'14 fighter pilots who had fled their country after fighting the Luftwaffe having been among the bravest in the Battle of Britain. More recently, \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  were drawn here by South Coast fruit farms offering seasonal work. As friends and families followed in their footsteps, hard work and initiative brought growing prosperity.\par \par \uc2 In Shirley, one of Southampton's major residential suburbs, Polish can be heard everywhere. Shop windows are filled with advertisement cards in Polish, hand-written by those looking for work or seeking or offering accommodation.\par \par \uc2 It's the kind of scenario that has Ukip supporters jumping up and down with outrage about the cost to society of Britain's reckless \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policies. And there are those here who call the city 'Little Poland' and rail against the Polish influx \u8212\'20\'14 but a walk along the length of Shirley High Street suggests a rather more complex reality.\par \par \uc2 Halfway down the street, greengrocers Andy and Pam Phillips have been selling fruit and veg for nearly half a century. Even on a quiet Tuesday afternoon, when the aisles of the local \uc2 Tesco\uc2  are almost deserted, there are queues in front of the stall which the husband and wife, both 72, run from outside their shop, Affordable Fruits.\par \par \uc2 'If it wasn't for the Poles, I would have closed down years ago,' says Mr Phillips. 'They're much healthier than the Brits, more old-fashioned. They eat loads of fruit and veg, and they cook from scratch.\par \par \uc2 'While lots of Brits go to the supermarkets, the Polish and the Eastern Europeans shop with us. We're the closest thing they can find to what they left back at home.\par \par \uc2 'They've injected new life into the area at a time when lots of shops around here were closing down.'\par \par \uc2 The couple know many of their customers by name.\par \par \uc2 'We even speak a bit of Polish to them \u8212\'20\'14 Czes? for hi, and Dzieki for thanks,' says Pam. 'It's a multi-cultural city and we have customers from all over the world. We don't care what nationality they are. We don't have an axe to grind with anyone.'\par \par \uc2 Beavering away alongside the pair is a quiet and petite young blonde woman, their Polish assistant Tosaa Mucha. The 32-year-old came to the UK seven years ago from a village outside Krakow with her husband Mareusz, who works on a chicken farm. Tosaa's mother cares for their five-year-old son, Mateusz.\par \par \uc2 Many Poles who come to the UK are following friends and relatives. Tosaa says they were encouraged to come by her brother-in-law, who had already found work here.\par \par \uc2 'We went to a Polish job agency and they quickly found us work,' she says. 'We have a much better life here. We can earn more money and look after our son, and there are so many more opportunities for him. There is plenty of good work here.'\par \par \uc2 Indeed, meeting and speaking to the Poles who have settled here, what is striking is just how self-reliant and aspirational they are.\par \par \uc2 Conversely, the men I see propped up in the doorway of The Shirley Hotel Pub in the midday sun, with a pint in one hand and a cigarette in the other, are British, not Polish.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, the harassed mothers with toddlers and babies, manhandling their buggies through the doors of the local \uc2 McDonald's\uc2 , are screeching at their children in English, not Polish.\par \par \uc2 Among the Phillipses' Polish customers is 29-year-old Pawel Krasinski, the man they fondly refer to as 'Mr Juicy'. He is buying armfuls of carrots and celery for the cold-pressed fresh fruit and vegetable juice business he runs from his nearby home.\par \par \uc2 'I came from south-west Poland seven years ago,' he says. 'I worked as a nutritionist there, but over here I found work with a food manufacturer and learnt everything I needed to know to set up my own food business. I could never have done that in Poland. There are better opportunities here if you are prepared to work hard.'\par \par \uc2 Pawel, who produces 40 bottles of juice each day and delivers them to customers by car, is now saving up to buy a \u163\'00\'A315,000 industrial-sized cold-presser so that he can expand his business.\par \par \uc2 Further along the High Street, tongue-in-cheek posters advertise Polish 'Pole Dancing' fitness classes run by 32-year-old single mother Marzena Bobova, who set up her business, M&K Dance And Fitness, two years ago.\par \par \uc2 The daughter of a factory worker, she came to the UK from the city of Czechowice-Dziedzice in 2008, with her lorry driver husband and their daughter Kasia, who is now 11.\par \par \uc2 In Poland, she earned \u163\'00\'A3200 a month as a sales assistant in a lighting shop. After her divorce, she worked in a photographic shop while training to be a dance instructor at nearby Eastleigh College.\par \par \uc2 'I was lucky because I went in to print my CV and the owner saw it and offered me a job,' she says. 'But I always dreamed of having my own dance business.'\par \par \uc2 Last year's Young Entrepreneur of the Year at the South Coast Business Awards was won by another young Pole, 22-year-old Tomasz Dyl, who has been running his own marketing agency, GottaBe, since the age of 17 while studying at \uc2 Southampton Solent University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Entrepreneurial stories such as these cast doubt on the commonly spouted argument that Poles are taking jobs from British workers.\par \par \uc2 And yet it is not hard to find those who are disgruntled with the way that Southampton has changed in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Lacy Flahavan, a 23-year-old mother from Shirley, says she sometimes feel intimidated by the number of Polish mothers at her 18-month-old son's nursery.\par \par \uc2 'It's slowly starting to become a Polish town,' she says. 'The mothers all stick together, and all speak Polish. It's quite intimidating, to be honest. I feel like I can't talk to parents outside of the playgroup because they are quite daunting groups.\par \par \uc2 'I have friends who have struggled to find jobs and have found it really difficult competing with the amount of people in this area.'\par \par \uc2 Ruth Peters, 72, who used to own a cleaning company, puts it rather more bluntly: 'There isn't enough room for everybody who comes to the city. There's a shortage of housing, and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  does also have an impact on jobs.\par \par \uc2 'While I know a lot of good comes from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , with the young Polish people who have such a good work ethic, there just isn't the room for any more.'\par \par \uc2 Mick Hudson, 61, who owns an electrical company in Shirley, says: 'When you walk up and down the High Street, English is a minority language. \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is a hot topic here, and you can understand why.'\par \par \uc2 Not surprisingly, the issue is one which Ukip has enthusiastically embraced. The party's Southampton chairman is Jamaican-born Pearline Hingston, who came to the UK in the Sixties.\par \par \uc2 She says: 'I've got nothing against Polish people. \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  from Eastern Europe are not to blame for coming to the UK. It is our Government that is at fault.\par \par \uc2 'We are now full, and cannot cope with any more car washers and painters and decorators. Public services are buckling under the strain. There are stresses on the sewage and waste system, and the hospitals and schools, and we have a problem with multi-occupancy houses. People talk about the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 but people in Southampton will tell you that the negatives outweigh the positives.'\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2 , Poles are now the most common non-British group of nationals living in the UK. Current figures suggest there are 700,000 Polish-born nationals living here, though some estimates place this figure closer to a million.\par \par \uc2 In \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  hotspots such as Southampton, this has undoubtedly placed additional pressures on schools and other services.\par \par \uc2 Among statistics cited by Ukip supporters is that the last ten years has seen an extra 1,000 babies being born every year in the city.\par \par \uc2 At St Mark's Primary School in Shirley's Stafford Road, pupils speak a staggering 42 different languages between them. Nearly a third speak Polish as their first language, and only one in four children are white British. The school featured in a BBC TV documentary, The Truth About \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2 , earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Councillor Simon Letts, the Labour leader of \uc2 Southampton City Council\uc2 , says the influx of Poles has been a 'breath of fresh air' to the city.\par \par \uc2 'They are keen to participate, and they're really economically active. Southampton is used to waves of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . We are an international port city. We are used to absorbing people and building what they have to offer into the wider mix of the city.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Letts, who says his daughter attends a local school with several Polish friends, adds: 'Our school results were falling slightly, but they're now up to the national average. I think that is partly due to the ethos of hard work that's come with the new \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .'\par \par \uc2 But he admits that the Polish influx has placed strains on council resources.\par \par \uc2 'We have had to manage things like school places. Our school places are now full, and we have had to provide additional school places for four schools with government money; but three of those are not in areas with a high concentration of Poles.\par \par \uc2 'A lot of it is to do with the national increase in birth rate. It has been an issue for the council, but we've resolved it.'\par \par \uc2 He also dismisses the idea that the Polish community is putting extra stresses on local hospitals. 'They are a young population, so they have a relatively low impact on hospital services. The vast majority are under 40, and they're putting far more into the city economically than they are taking out in terms of health.\par \par \uc2 'There are some stresses and strains on the system, but there is also an upside in the number of new businesses being created that are paying business rates, and the contribution that people make to city life.'\par \par \uc2 His argument is backed up by 64-year-old Polish-born Barbara Storey, who came to the UK 20 years ago to marry her naval officer husband, Peter. She set up charity and business support group SOS Polonia ten years ago, offering advice to newcomers from Poland.\par \par \uc2 'People come because of aspiration or desperation,' she says. 'Either way, they want to work and find new opportunities. They don't come for benefits.\par \par \uc2 'The idea that they are taking jobs from local people is not true either. I had a big employer come to me in desperation because he needed 40 people for his work force and not one person had replied to his advert in the Job Centre.\par \par \uc2 'Within two days of alerting the local community, he had 80 applications from Polish workers. They don't undercut anyone else's wages and they are paying their taxes.\par \par \uc2 'When they first arrive, Polish people are prepared to take most jobs because they understand that they have to prove themselves.'\par \par \uc2 For those, like me, who remember Shirley as it was \u8212\'20\'14 with a High Street lined with shoe shops and old-fashioned ladies' corsetry shops, two fishmongers and a butcher \u8212\'20\'14 it is impossible not to feel nostalgic about the past.\par \par \uc2 But the decline of such shops, from the late Eighties onwards, came long before the arrival of the Poles. Aside from the Polish stores, what is striking about Shirley High Street is the vast number of charity shops. Sue Ryder is here, so is Oxfam and Cancer Research.\par \par \uc2 In between, you will find a pound store and a mobility scooter shop, as well as a couple of boarded-up pubs. The Polish economy is the only one that appears to be blossoming here.\par \par \uc2 It is the businesses that have embraced the changes brought by \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  that seem to be doing the best.\par \par \uc2 The oldest shop on the street is Plested Pies, which is something of a culinary institution in Southampton for those who can still remember when their pies could be bought for a shilling apiece. The company has had a shop here since 1933, and the queue of people waiting for a batch of freshly baked pies is a mixture of Brits and Poles, as well as other Eastern Europeans and Asians.\par \par \uc2 Owner Tony Anthony Jones says: 'The arrival of the Polish hasn't hurt my business at all. I've never had any problems. Everyone is welcome here.'\par \par \uc2 Shirley High Street, he admits, has changed beyond recognition in recent years. 'But that's the reality of life, isn't it?' he says. 'Times change, and you have to adapt or fall by the wayside.'\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140425ea4q0000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Fruitcakes, herberts and the Gateshead Conga: when Nigel took on the North\b0\par\par\uc2 Michael Deacon   \par \uc2 1,203 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 April 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph\par \uc2 DT\par \uc2 2; National\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Sketch\par \par \uc2 IF I had to pick one moment that summed up Ukip's tour of northern England, it would be this. It was Wednesday night in Gateshead, and, sporting the leer of satisfaction that must haunt David Cameron's dreams, Nigel Farage had just sauntered on stage at Ukip's largest public meeting yet, to the idolatrous acclaim of more than 1,000 supporters. Finally the applause died down. He opened his mouth to speak.\par \par \uc2 It was at this point that two young men in the audience stood up and, to the tune of the Conga, began chanting, "F\u8211\'20\'13\u8211\'20\'13\u8211\'20\'13off back to Toad Hall! F\u8211\'20\'13\u8211\'20\'13\u8211\'20\'13 off back to Toad Hall! Na, na, na, na \u8211\'20\'13 hey! Na, na, na, na \u8211\'20\'13 hey!" Mr Farage declined their invitation, and the two men \u8211\'20\'13 still merrily chanting \u8211\'20\'13 were thrown out.\par \par \uc2 Whereupon, presumably, they were congratulated by the 100\u8211\'20\'13odd protesters \u8211\'20\'13 or, to quote Mr Farage, "herberts" \u8211\'20\'13 gathered outside. (Banners: "Migrants Welcome, Bigots Aren't" and a caricature of Mr Farage, with a speech bubble that read, "I represent the interests of the ruling class".)\par \par \uc2 Well, it was never going to be easy. In an effort to dispel the impression that Ukip is merely a party of south\u8211\'20\'13east England, supported by Tories who find the Tories insufficiently Tory, Mr Farage spent this week campaigning in the North. Labour, he kept declaring, had "betrayed" the northern working class \u8211\'20\'13 and, at the European elections next month, the northern working class could get its own back by voting Ukip. "This Labour Party, they have turned their backs on you," he told Gateshead. "You are no longer represented by them."\par \par \uc2 The question was: could Gateshead be represented by a Thatcherite public schoolboy from Kent?\par \par \uc2 The tour started on Tuesday in Sheffield, where Mr Farage unveiled Ukip's blunt new billboards ("26 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?"). Then it was off to a hotel conference room for the first of his nightly public meetings.\par \par \uc2 The protesters outside were easily outnumbered by the 600 admirers in the audience. I glanced around the room. Roughly 50:50, men and women; many but not all middle\u8211\'20\'13aged and above. The only non\u8211\'20\'13white face I spotted was on stage, and belonged to Amjad Bashir, Ukip's spokesman for small business. (The next day, on the campaign trail, a journalist asked Mr Farage whether Ukip was racist. "I mean, frankly," he replied, shaking his head, "you've only got to look at\u8230\'20\'26 where's Amjad?" Mr Bashir was in a nearby florist's, paying for the six red roses Mr Farage had just picked up to mark St George's Day.)\par \par \uc2 The Sheffield speech went down a storm. Ukip rallies are far livelier than those of other parties: they seethe with a kind of angry energy, a furious optimism. "I didn't know there were so many fruitcakes in Sheffield!" honked Mr Farage. The room guffawed. The night finished with a Q&A session. One man was thrown out, after refusing to stop shouting out hostile questions about the party's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy.\par \par \uc2 The next day, Mr Farage was due to visit the town of Yarm, Stockton\u8211\'20\'13on\u8211\'20\'13Tees. Awaiting his arrival outside, I spent 10 entertaining minutes watching a local man subject three glum Ukip officials to interrogations of Paxmanlike aggression. I wish I could convey in print his gasp of appalled glee when a Ukip candidate proved unable to tell him how many EU migrants work in Britain.\par \par \uc2 Sadly, Paxman had gone by the time Mr Farage pulled up in his battle bus. The Ukip leader spent 40 minutes strolling round town amid a swarm of journalists. Perhaps the swarm put locals off \u8212\'20\'14 I saw him speak to just two of them. One was a man in a vest with a shaven head and murky tattoos. "Never voted in me life before, but I'm voting for you," he told Mr Farage. A beaming Mr Farage asked why. "This is not our country no more," replied the man, darkly.\par \par \uc2 Next day's stop: Knutsford, a wellheeled Cheshire town best\u8211\'20\'13known as the inspiration for Cranford. It didn't look as if it could be easily classified among the "Labour heartlands" Mr Farage had so noisily set his sights on. The local MP is one G Osborne. Still, explained the Ukip leader, it was important "to remind ourselves that there are some Tories who are thinking about voting Ukip as well". Evidently so. He found Knutsford almost universally adoring. After a good half\u8211\'20\'13hour of handshakes, he was chauffeured away. Mere minutes, coincidentally, before news broke that Andre Lampitt, a Ukip candidate, had been suspended by the party for sending racist tweets.\par \par \uc2 That night's rally was in Manchester. Although Mr Lampitt's name was all over the news, it received no mention at the rally. Mr Farage did, though, announce that Ukip could be proud of having turned \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  into "a mature and respectable debate". I googled Mr Lampitt's tweets. "Inner peace will come when Aids does what it should and reduce African density." Well, I suppose that one was more about population growth than \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Louise Bours, a Ukip councillor, told the audience that "the only time that people call you racist is when they've got nothing else to say. They've lost the argument. They have to insult us. It's like playground bullying". I hope Mr Lampitt doesn't feel he's been bullied.\par \par \uc2 So: Ukip in the North. From what I saw, it can win plenty of votes there. On the other hand, those who don't like it really don't like it. In Gateshead, Mr Farage told his audience that Ukip "will beat Labour in their heartlands" and that "the days of mockery of Ukip are over". The first prediction may come true; the second may be optimistic.\par \par \uc2 Ukip blunder Poster 'Briton' is Irish migrant\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage last night faced embarrassment over his plans to curb migration from Europe, after it emerged that an actor in a UK Independence Party billboard is an Irish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The "destitute builder" in Ukip's latest advertisement is believed to be a Dubliner, a party spokesman confirmed.\par \par \uc2 Dave O'Rourke is pictured sitting on a pavement with a beggar's cup, with a caption suggesting he is British.\par \par \uc2 The poster was unveiled by Mr Farage earlier this week, when he said he would like to see \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  cut to 30,000 to 50,000 people a year. Britain would no longer be subject to "open\u8211\'20\'13door" \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  but would install a restricted work permit scheme, he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr O'Rourke has lived in the UK for 10 years, according to an online profile. Under Ukip proposals, he would not be able to move to Britain unless he showed he was "highly skilled".\par \par \uc2 Patrick O'Flynn, Ukip's head of communications, said: "The vast majority of people used in political poster campaigns are actors. It is totally standard practice. It is nonsense for the Conservative Party to try to depict this as anything out of the ordinary."\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140426ea4q00071\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw142\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2130\pichgoal600

He walked, smiling, through the town market while clutching a brolly.\par \par \uc2 Pressing flesh and wooing voters, Mr Farage said: "The British Social Attitude Survey that was published a few weeks ago showed over 60 per cent of the ethnic communities in Britain - and that includes first generation migrants and people who've come in the last few years - agree Britain needs tougher border controls than it's currently got.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a race issue, it's actually an issue about jobs. It's an issue about community. It's an issue about public services.\par \par \uc2 "Don't forget, our population has increased by four million through \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  over the course of the last 15 years. We can't go on like this and this is something that crosses all religions and all backgrounds."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage added: "We have struggled in Birmingham for a long time to find the right (UKIP) people and today there are half a dozen people who are volunteers who are running the Central Birmingham branch.\par \par \uc2 "They are quite young, they are very enthusiastic and that's why the council candidates that we have got in Birmingham are the highest we have had here by a long way.\par \par \uc2 "Clearly here in Dudley, we are going to win seats because here's a wellestablished branch. In Birmingham, it's pot luck." At Dudley's Britannia pub, 18-year-old Brandon Smith and his grandfather David Smith, 65, posed for a selfie with Mr Farage.\par \par \uc2 Brandon, a groundworker, said: "I told him that I was a first time voter and he had some sense. He said 'well done.'" David added: "He's a popular bloke. He won't get in but he'll cause an earthquake."\par \par \uc2 Document EVEMAI0020140426ea4q0001l\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Now Ukip's second poster boy builder is revealed to be an IRISH actor as Farage battles to rescue his \u163\'00\'A31.5m ad campaign\b0\par\par\uc2 GERRI PEEV and MATT CHORLEY, MAILONLINE POLITICAL EDITOR   \par \uc2 1,158 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 April 2014\par 02:17\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

We have put in place a vetting procedure and something has gone wrong.'\par \par \uc2 'Voter' is Ukip events manager\par \par \uc2 Lizzy Vaid appears in a full-page photograph as a voter from Devon, but is actually Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s events manager and an assistant to the party leader.\par \par \uc2 UKIP RESPONSE: Nigel Farage: 'The fact that Lizzie Laid is half-Indian and works for us is as far as we are concerned a non-issue. Most parties use actors. We use Ukippers.'\par \par \uc2 'Jobless builder' is an Irish actor\par \par \uc2 Eye-catching poster shows a builder begging on the street with the message: 'EU policy at work. British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour.'\par \par \uc2 But he is Dave O'Rourke, an actor from Ireland who moved to Britain 10 years ago.\par \par \uc2 UKIP RESPONSE: Director of communications Patrick O'Flynn: 'The vast majority of people used in political poster campaigns are actors. It is totally standard practice.'\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19m originally from Dublin, Living in the UK 10 years.

We use Ukippers.'\par \par \uc2 It followed the revelation that 'Lizzy Vaid from Devon' who featured in the party's manifesto is actually Ukip's events manager based in London.\par \par \uc2 Another row blew up yesterday after David Challice, a leading party activist in the South West, placed an advert in his local newspaper for his discount store business which offered a \u8216\'20\'18money spinner\u8217\'20\'19 \u8216\'20\'18for \u8216\'20\'18any cash-strapped Moslem [sic] reading this\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 It went on to suggest that men could take a \u8216\'20\'18harem\u8217\'20\'19 of wives to get an extra \u163\'00\'A333.65 a week in\u160\'00\'A0 benefits from the Department for Work and Pensions for each of them.\par \par \uc2 He also made sexist comments suggesting women should not go out to work, that they were\u160\'00\'A0 natural home makers.\par \par \uc2 Mr Challice said he had discussed this issue with his wife Hilary and that \u8216\'20\'18since the snow came back all she\u8217\'20\'19s done is look through the window. If it gets any worse I\u8217\'20\'19ll have to let her back in again\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Ukip leader Nigel Farage yesterday admitted 'something went wrong' with the party's vetting system.\par \par \uc2 As Ukip struggled to get its election campaign back on track, Conservative MP Bob Neill said of the poster using an Irish actor to depict a British builder: \u8216\'20\'18Here is another example of Ukip being cynical and not being straight with the British voters.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Ukip director of communications Patrick O\u8217\'20\'19Flynn said: \u8216\'20\'18The vast majority of people used in political poster campaigns are actors. It is nonsense for the Conservative Party to try and depict this as anything out of the ordinary.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The party defended Mr Challice\u8217\'20\'19s comments in his advert, saying there were \u8216\'20\'18quite legitimate concerns about the interaction of the benefits system with men who have multiple wives\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman added: \u8216\'20\'18Mr Challice\u8217\'20\'19s remarks about women in the workplace and his wife were intended as a joke and indeed were understood as such. He does not seriously believe women should not work. Given that his wife works in the same office as he does, it would be curious if he did.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Mr Challice also made derogatory remarks about Greeks and Turks in a book he published.\par \par \uc2 On another front, Mr Farage last night faced accusations that he was changing his tune on having his expenses audited.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader had earlier suggested that he would be happy to have a probe into his allowances as an MEP.\par \par \uc2 But in an interview with the Guardian last night, he denied he had ever suggested it. \u8216\'20\'18I said if every other British MEP wants to, then I would. I am not going to be one out of 73 that is held up as an example of all that is wrong with the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140425ea4p004se\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Mother in fear of FGM for daughters could be detained\b0\par\par\uc2 By Sarah Morrison and Justin Cash   \par \uc2 207 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 April 2014\par \uc2 i\par \uc2 IIND\par \uc2 1ST\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd.

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News\par \par \uc2 An asylum-seeker who fears that her two young daughters will become victims of female genital mutilation (FGM) if they return to Nigeria could be detained in Britain, alongside her children, after refusing to board a flight home yesterday.\par \par \uc2 Afusat Saliu, 31, a victim of FGM, was reportedly too worried about her daughters Bassy, aged three, and Rashidat, one, to voluntarily return to Nigeria yesterday. She now may be forcibly removed.\par \par \uc2 Last night, Ms Saliu's MP, George Mudie, was in talks directly with the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister's office, asking for her case to be reconsidered. More than 100,000 people have signed a petition calling on the Home Office to review her claim. Yet a last-minute legal attempt to get her case reconsidered earlier this week failed.\par \par \uc2 "It's one thing taking the chance on sending an adult back," Mr Mudie told The Independent. "But these are two defenceless children. The minister has to assure me they've got good grounds for believing they will be safe\u8230\'20\'26 the consequences of getting it wrong are so grave."\par \par \uc2 Anj Handa, who is leading the campaign to prevent Ms Saliu's deportation, said that "many have questioned why, given our Government's stated strong line on eradicating FGM in the UK and abroad, that it is willing to send the girls to this likely fate." A leading barrister, Felicity Gerry, QC, who has provided support for Ms Saliu, said "the idea of a mother and children trying to argue their case from abroad and survive traditional cultural pressure\u8230\'20\'26 is beyond comprehension and hopefully someone in Government will look at the matter afresh."\par \par \uc2 Ms Saliu, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, said she fled Nigeria in 2011 after her stepmother wanted her eldest child to undergo FGM. She said she applied for asylum in 2012 but was refused. Subsequent appeals have been quashed.\par \par \uc2 She told The Independent earlier this week that she was fighting on behalf of her children. "It's so scary. I don't want them going through the same pain I went through," she said. According to the Home Office, families who remain in the country illegally could be sent to an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  removal centre suitable for children.\par \par \uc2 After controversy surrounding the detention of children, the Government set up Cedars in 2011, a secure facility which accommodates up to nine families in self-contained apartments. The "pre-departure accommodation" is run by several agencies, including G4S and the charity Barnardos.\par \par \uc2 A spokesperson for the Home Office said: "We believe that those who fail to establish a genuine fear of persecution should return home voluntarily. If they do not, we will enforce their removal."\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140426ea4q0006j\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15
