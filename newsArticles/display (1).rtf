\par\par \b \uc2 Nigel Farage lacks answers on Europe, says Rachida Dati\b0\par\par\uc2 By George Parker, Political Editor   \par \uc2 537 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par 15:47\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage is "intelligent and charismatic" and is not a racist, according to Rachida Dati, a European MP and former French justice minister who is campaigning for votes among London's French community.\par \par \uc2 But Ms Dati said Mr Farage and his UK Independence party had no solutions to the problems facing Europe, ahead of European elections that are expected to show a surge of support for populist parties.\par \par \uc2 The French MEP was speaking in London, where the capital's estimated 300,000 French residents - many of whom work in the City - are seen as a fruitful source of votes for Ms Dati's centre-right UMP party.\par \par \uc2 London's French voters can choose whether they wish to cast their votes for British candidates in the UK capital or for French candidates, including Ms Dati, in the Ile de France region around Paris.\par \par \uc2 "There is a caricature that [these voters] all left France for financial reasons," she said. "No. They might come here for work but also for many other things. I think one of the things that draws people here is that London is a very cosmopolitan city."\par \par \uc2 Ms Dati draws a distinction between the politics of Mr Farage and those of Marine Le Pen's National Front in France, whose rise is threatening an upset to the political establishment in Paris.\par \par \uc2 She said France would send out a depressing message to the world if "the country of light, the country of human rights" elected large numbers of MEPs to the European parliament from "the extreme right".\par \par \uc2 But she said Mr Farage was in a different category: "He's someone who poses important questions but doesn't have the solutions. His politics are all about charisma but his solutions are not in the interests of Britain or Europe.\par \par \uc2 "He is defending nationalistic populist interests and that is why he's high in the polls - that's why he's popular. But is he racist? No, I don't believe so."\par \par \uc2 Ms Dati said Europe needed to have a smaller voice in certain areas but be more active on big questions such as foreign policy. "Have you heard Europe's voice on Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, what's been happening in north Africa?" she asked. "No."\par \par \uc2 The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.\par \par \uc2 <>Ms Dati sprang to international fame as a glamorous young minister in \uc2 Nicolas Sarkozy\uc2 's government, the daughter of North African \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who rose from an impoverished background.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether she would support Mr Sarkozy in another run for the Elys\u233\'00\'E9e in 2017, she said: "He's my candidate. If he wins, it's my country that wins."\par \par \uc2 Would she like another ministerial job? "I'm not intoxicated by that sort of thing." She added: "With my life and my temperament, I could do lots of different things."\par \par \uc2 Ms Dati said France should try to help the "intelligent" David Cameron win his proposed in-out referendum in 2017. "It's the responsibility of Europe. I support the British and David Cameron. It's our responsibility and in our interest."\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140521ea5l0038q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Predictions of populist takeover in Europe are far fetched\b0\par\par\uc2 By Tony Barber in London   \par \uc2 746 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par 15:00\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Few politicians are less prone to alarmism than Herman Van Rompuy, the soft-spoken president of the European Council, which groups the EU's 28 national government leaders. Yet when the German newspaper \uc2 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\uc2  asked him, in an April 2010 interview, what were the biggest risks facing Europe, he replied: "The great danger is populism."\par \par \uc2 Four years later, on the eve of the May 22-25 elections to the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , it is tempting to see Mr Van Rompuy's warning as extraordinarily prophetic. From France and the UK to Greece, Hungary and the Netherlands, Europe's populist movements seem to be riding the crest of a wave whipped up by the post-2008 financial crisis, economic recession, large-scale \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and disgust with incompetence and corruption in national politics.\par \par \uc2 But apocalyptic forecasts of European democracy sinking under an unstoppable populist tide are far-fetched. Latest opinion polls suggest that Europe's three leading mainstream political groups - the centre-right European People's party, the centre-left Socialists and Democrats and the liberal ALDE movement - will win just under two-thirds of the total vote and pick up more than 480 of the assembly's 751 seats. The far right, far left and other anti-EU forces will have their work cut out to stop the parliament from functioning as usual.\par \par \uc2 What is more, a nation-by-nation look at the EU's electoral scene demonstrates that populism, at least of the far-right variety, is not on a roll everywhere. Most obviously, the far right is a speck on the landscape in countries such as Germany, the EU's most populous state, and Spain. True, Germany's eurosceptic Alternative f\u252\'00\'FCr Deutschland party may win up to six seats in the EU legislature, and even the authentically far-right National Democrats may win one, but overall the radical right is as irrelevant in Germany as neo-Francoism is in Spain.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, a minority of European voters casts ballots regularly for the radical right. According to a 2012 study by the London-based Counterpoint think-tank, these voters tend to be older, less educated and hostile to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Blue-collar workers are more likely to vote for such parties in Denmark, France, Norway and Sweden.\par \par \uc2 In France, women are more likely than men to support the radical right, the study found. In the Netherlands, a voter who favours the far-right, anti-Islamic Freedom Party of Geert Wilders is likely to oppose Muslim \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , distrust the Dutch political elite and feel nostalgic for the highly regulated, consensus-driven political order that characterised the nation for much of the 20th century.\par \par \uc2 The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.\par \par \uc2 <>According to Cas Mudde, a Dutch political scientist at the University of Georgia, the far right has made electoral advances in 10 of the EU's 28 countries since the onset of the financial crisis, registering its biggest successes - gains of more than 5 percentage points - in Austria, France, Hungary and Latvia. But in nine countries the far right has been on the back foot, suffering losses of more than 5 percentage points in Belgium, Italy and Slovakia.\par \par \uc2 Duncan McDonnell, an expert on political extremism at the \uc2 European University Institute\uc2  in Florence, says predictions that the far right will win up to a third of the EU assembly's seats are wide of the mark. He points out that it is important to distinguish between unashamedly far-right parties, such as Golden Dawn in Greece and Jobbik in Hungary, and unconventional, anti-establishment movements that do not belong to that end of the political spectrum, such as Italy's Five-Star Movement or AfD in Germany.\par \par \uc2 According to a poll published on May 7 by VoteWatch Europe, a research group, the next legislature will probably contain three political groups to the right of the EPP, with approximately 40 seats each. That amounts to less than 16 per cent of all seats. However, some parties expected to enter these cross-national groups, such as the British Conservatives, are not far-right at all.\par \par \uc2 Arguably, the real question is therefore not whether the far right will ever have a sniff of power. It is the extent to which mainstream parties incorporate the far right's views on Europe and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  into their own policies.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140521ea5l002xl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Editorial; Opinion Columns\par \b \uc2 We must expose Ukip as the racist party it really is\b0\par\par\uc2 Matthew d'Ancona   \par \uc2 1,099 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par \uc2 London Evening Standard\par \uc2 NS\par \uc2 1; National\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited   \par \par \uc2 Senior politicians have fought shy of challenging Nigel Farage. But the capital's voters can tell him where to go\par \par \uc2 ON THE eve of Ukip's potential triumph in the European elections, it is remarkable to recall just how humble its origins truly were. The Anti-Federalist League was founded in 1991 by the historian Alan Sked to mobilise opposition to the Maastricht Treaty. The group was almost cheerfully marginal, a singleissue anti-EU campaign which occasionally dipped its toe in electoral waters. In 1993, the league became the UK Independence Party \u8212\'20\'14 a fractious movement which, in the years that followed, flirted with extinction on several occasions. Remember Robert Kilroy-Silk breaking away to found his own party, "Veritas"? (Whatever happened to Veritas?) In any case, against the odds, Ukip survived under Nigel Farage's leadership, prospered, and now, 23 years after Professor Sked founded his little league, the monster it spawned stands on the brink of an extraordinary electoral breakthrough.\par \par \uc2 The last lap of these elections \u8212\'20\'14 to the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , in 161 English councils, and 11 new local authorities in Northern Ireland \u8212\'20\'14 has been strained and stained by the question of Ukip's alleged racism. I say "alleged" because the party is so comically insistent that it has not a racist bone in its collective body. But let us be candid. If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, the fact that it denies vociferously being tasty if served with orange sauce does not settle the matter.\par \par \uc2 On Monday's Newsnight, Farage declared himself "hurt" by the accusation. But \u8212\'20\'14 whatever the state of his delicate emotions \u8212\'20\'14 is he really surprised? It was he who started the ball rolling at Ukip's spring conference in February, when he insisted that parts of Britain were becoming "unrecognisable" thanks to mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  ("This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren.") Last week, in an astonishing LBC interview, he went even further: "I was asked if a group of Romanian men moved in next door, would you be concerned? And if you lived in London, I think you would be."\par \par \uc2 If this is not racist, then nothing is racist. In his fascinating book, Racism Without Racists, American sociologist Edouardo Bonilla-Silva shows that the decline of overt claims about supposed genetic difference between the races has been replaced by a more subtle prejudices about culture, behaviour, and propensity to crime: what has become known as "symbolic racism".\par \par \uc2 Ukip exemplifies this modern phenomenon. It claims in its branding that it is a "non-racist" party, just as every institution or employer in the land makes a similar assertion in paragraph one of its mission statement. But Farage's recent remarks have illustrated the agile capacity of bigotry to adapt, camouflage itself and survive.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader himself realised that he had gone too far with his remarks about putative Romanian neighbours and published a full-page advert in the Daily Telegraph, clarifying his position though not resiling from it. He also claimed to have been "tired" \u8212\'20\'14 not a reassuring excuse from a leader who surely sees himself in the long, sleepless watches of the night as a future Deputy Prime Minister in a Conservative-Ukip coalition.\par \par \uc2 A truly desperate bid by his party to prove its multi-ethnic credentials with a carnival in Croydon yesterday ended in farce, as the steel band refused to play, Farage failed to turn up, and the party's organisers declared Croydon a "dump".\par \par \uc2 Extraordinary, then, to behold the response of senior politicians from the main parties to Ukip's predicament. It has become orthodox \u8212\'20\'14 pathetically so \u8212\'20\'14 that Farage's party must not be declared racist or accused of stirring up ethnic division, on the grounds that this would implicitly label Ukip's supporters as bigots and dissuade them from returning to the Tory or Labour fold.\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband, deploying all the sophistry that his self-proclaimed "intellectual self-confidence" could muster, told Sky that Farage's remarks were indeed "a racial slur" but that the Ukip leader was not a racist. \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , meanwhile, declared to the Daily Mail that Farage's remark about Romanian neighbours "was an appalling thing to say. They [Ukip] are being found out."\par \par \uc2 But "found out" as what, exactly? The Prime Minister leaves that to our imagination. The polls suggest \u8212\'20\'14 or so our senior politicians believe \u8212\'20\'14 that "calling Ukip names" is backfiring. So they stop short of speaking the truth.\par \par \uc2 This is feeble. Identifying and challenging racism is not "name-calling" or playground politics: it is essential to social cohesion. Leadership has nothing to do with timorously refusing to upset the voters. Often, it involves precisely that: confronting the public with the unwelcome truth about the populists stirring up their anxieties and fears. Caveat elector.\par \par \uc2 Much credit is due to those few who have refused to settle for the generally pusillanimous response to Farage (Labour's David Lammy, Yvette Cooper, and Barbara Roche, for instance). Where have the Conservative modernisers been in all this? It is good that \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  is today highlighting the threat Ukip represents to Britain's economic place in the world. "Political parties on the Left and the populist Right have this in common," is the Chancellor's message. "They want to pull up the drawbridge and shut Britain off from the world." But the Tory modernising movement had its roots in an embrace of the world as it is, in all its social complexity and its fizzing diversity. The comparative reticence of the Conservative mods in the face of Ukip's appalling rhetoric has been almost as depressing as the rhetoric itself.\par \par \uc2 So \u8212\'20\'14 as so often in history \u8212\'20\'14 it is left to Londoners to speak for the nation. Tomorrow, they will vote for representatives in 32 boroughs, choose four borough mayors, and select eight MEPs to go to Strasbourg. Ukip has a single elected borough councilor, in Havering, although the party claims that 19 further individuals have defected to its banner. One of our eight MEPs is Ukip's Gerald Batten. Two years ago, in an unforgettable Olympic summer, the voters of London reminded the world that this is the truly global city. Tomorrow, they should speak out again.\par \par \uc2 Matthew d'Ancona is speaking about his book on the Coalition at the Hay Festival this Saturday at 1pm hayfestival.org\par \par \uc2 As so often in history it is left to Londoners to speak for the nation\par \par \uc2 Document NS00000020140521ea5l0008v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

The annexation was a first by a major power in Europe since 1945.\par \par \uc2 Commentators have likened Russia's handing of the Ukraine crisis to Hitler\u8217\'20\'19s takeovers of Poland and Czechoslovakia and have criticised Mr Putin's use of special forces in disguise to stir up tension in disputed areas.\par \par \uc2 The Prince of Wales, who is due to meet Mr Putin at the D-Day commemorations in France on June 6, made his well-intentioned but unguarded comment during a visit to the Canadian Museum of \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the Mail said.\par \par \uc2 The prince is on a tour of Canada with the Duchess of Cornwall \u8211\'20\'13 they have 41 engagements in just three and a half days.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday night Clarence House sources said the Prince of Wales had a private conversation with a woman who had lost relatives in the Holocaust.\par \par \uc2 "It was a private, empathetic, conversation with a lady who had lost family members in the Holocaust," the source said.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the pair paid tribute to Second World War veterans and their families at the museum in Halifax\u8217\'20\'19s docks.\par \par \uc2 Prince Charles was introduced to Marienne Ferguson, a museum volunteer who fled to Canada with her Jewish family when she was just 13.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Ferguson, 78, was born in what is now the Polish city of Gdansk. A free city under the terms of the Versailles Treaty after the end of the Great War, it was seized by the Nazis on the first day of fighting in 1939.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Ferguson and her parents, two sisters and grandmother had managed to obtain permits to sail to Canada.

Mother-of-three Mrs Ferguson said: "I had finished showing him the exhibit and talked with him about my own family background and how I came to Canada.\par \par \uc2 "The prince then said 'And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler'.\par \par \uc2 "I must say that I agree with him and am sure a lot of people do. I was very surprised that he made the comment as I know they [members of the Royal Family] aren\u8217\'20\'19t meant to say these things but it was very heartfelt and honest.\par \par \uc2 "I told the prince that while my family and I were lucky to get a permit to travel, many of my other relatives had permits but were unable to get out before war broke out on September 1. They were sent to the concentration camps and died."\par \par \uc2 It is unusual for a senior royal to express an opinion on sensitive political issues as they are supposed to remain politically neutral.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Clarence House said last night they would not comment on a private conversation.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140520ea5k0076d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

In an interview with the Standard, he said the notorious adverts \u8212\'20\'14 branded racially insensitive \u8212\'20\'14 had been "absolutely nothing to do with the Conservative Party".\par \par \uc2 When asked if a Tory minister at the Home Office had commissioned them, the party's campaign chief responded: "I don't know. Was it a Liberal? A Conservative? It possibly wasn't commissioned by a minister at all.\par \par \uc2 "It doesn't seem right to me to say something done by the Government is done by a political party. There's no chance of us ever commissioning something like that as a party, ever."\par \par \uc2 But Lib-Dem ex-Home Office minister Jeremy Browne accused Mr Shapps of an "outrageous attempt to rewrite history". He said: "What Grant Shapps is saying now is a complete misrepresentation of what happened." Mr Shapps spoke in Harrow where he toured the first Hindu infants school in Britain, at a site local Tories want for the first Hindu secondary using the Government's free schools programme. Harrow, where six in 10 voters are from minority communities, is a key Tory target in tomorrow's local elections.\par \par \uc2 "If the Conservatives win in Harrow it will be with more people from minorities than not," said Mr Shapps. The Tory chairman said he was proud his party had made strides in recruiting ethnic minority members but conceded some branches had not been welcoming enough. "I don't think it's job done," he added.\par \par \uc2 The "go home" ads were launched in London last year and featured posters, on two vans, showing a picture of handcuffs and the slogan: "In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest." Asked if the ads had been launched to counter the Ukip threat, Mr Shapps said: "Hold on there, this was not a Conservative ad van, this was something probably approved by some bureaucrats in Whitehall that I have never met. This is absolutely nothing to do with the Conservative Party."\par \par \uc2 But Lib-Dem president Tim Farron stormed: "This is a bit rich. The vans were a Conservative idea and were promoted publicly by Conservative ministers. They're not on the streets now because Lib-Dems stopped them."\par \par \uc2 Mr Browne said he was kept in the dark about the "Go home" campaign, adding: "It was part of a programme of initiatives that were each approved and defended by Mark Harper, then the Conservative \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister.\par \par \uc2 "Grant Shapps is giving different messages to different audiences. He is trying to reassure voters minded to defect to Ukip, while trying to appeal to other voters of a more liberal disposition."\par \par \uc2 Editorial Comment Page 14 Matthew d'Ancona Page 14\par \par \uc2 'This was not a Conservative ad van.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg defended the prince over the comment, which could hit already tense Anglo-Russian relations.\par \par \uc2 The heir to the throne is said to have likened the Russian president to the Nazi leader in a private conversation during a visit to Canada. Condemning Russia's actions over Ukraine, 'Royals don't have to take vow of silence' Charles is reported as telling a Jewish woman who lost relatives in the Nazi Holocaust: "And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg declined to comment on the specific allegation but supported the Prince of Wales giving his views on British and global controversies.\par \par \uc2 "I certainly support his right to speak freely, particularly in conversations he thinks are private," he told the BBC.\par \par \uc2 "I have never been of this view that if you are a member of the Royal Family somehow you have to enter into some Trappist vow of silence."\par \par \uc2 Asked if he agreed there were parallels to be drawn between Nazi Germany and Russia's annexation of Crimea plus intervention in eastern Ukraine, the Liberal Democrat leader said: "I'm not going to start comparing one period of European history to another.\par \par \uc2 "All I'd say is that right now I think the behaviour of Putin is not only menacing to Ukraine but it is very destabilising for Europe more generally." Downing Street and the Foreign Office declined to comment, although No 10 highlighted that the Prince's conversation had been private. A Clarence House spokesman said: "We would like to stress the Prince of Wales would not seek to make a public political statement during a private conversation." Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who said previously he admired Mr Putin for his handling of the Syrian crisis, disagreed with the prince's reported comment.\par \par \uc2 He added: "The difference is that right from the very start Hitler was expansionist and we haven't seen much evidence of that until now from Putin. Arguably what has happened in the Ukraine is because he has been poked with a stick by the rest of the world."\par \par \uc2 The Labour Party's deputy leader \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2  declined to voice backing for the Prince, saying: "It was an official visit, was it not? I think I'm just going to refer you to the Palace."\par \par \uc2 Labour MP Mike Gapes, ex-chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, tweeted: "If Charles wants to make controversial statements on national or international issues he should abdicate and stand for election. In constitutional monarchy, policy and diplomacy should be conducted by Parliament and Government. Monarchy should be seen and not heard." The Kremlin remained silent on the row today, as did most of the Russian media. However, the website of major popular newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, seen as pro-Kremlin, warned that Charles "risks triggering an international scandal and complicating the already far from cloudless relations between Great Britain and Russia".\par \par \uc2 Charles's remark came on a tour of the Museum of \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  in Halifax, Nova Scotia, as he and the Duchess of Cornwall paid tribute to Second World War veterans and their families.\par \par \uc2 Jewish museum volunteer Marienne Ferguson, 78, told the Prince she fled to Canada with her family shortly before the Nazis annexed the Baltic coastal Free City of Gdansk in 1939.\par \par \uc2 After meeting Charles, Mrs Ferguson said: "He told me, 'And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler'.\par \par \uc2 "I must say I agree with him and am sure a lot of people do. But I was very surprised he made the comment as I know Royal Family members are not meant to say these things." Charles is due to meet Mr Putin in a few weeks at the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy on June 6. The Standard understands that he is refusing to cooperate with a "master plan" over transition of the reign.\par \par \uc2 He fears, we have been told, that if he adopts the Palace plan to make him a "shadow King" it will limit his right to speak out, to which he is not prepared to sign up.\par \par \uc2 Document NS00000020140521ea5l0005p\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Prince Charles 'compares Vladimir Putin with Adolf Hitler'\b0\par\par\uc2 By Benjamin Russell   \par \uc2 929 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par 12:53\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 THE Prince of Wales has sparked a row after he allegedly compared the actions of Russian leader Vladimir Putin to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.\par \par \uc2 Prince Charles allegedly compared Putin to Hitler [AP/PA]\par \par \uc2 Charles appeared to back growing international anger from the West at Russia's actions in Ukraine during his tour of Canada when he spoke to a woman who fled the Nazis and lost family members during the Holocaust.\par \par \uc2 His remark came during a tour of the Museum of \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  in Halifax, Nova Scotia, when the Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall paid tribute to Second World War veterans and their families.\par \par \uc2 Jewish museum volunteer Marienne Ferguson told the Prince that she fled to Canada with her family shortly before the Nazis annexed the Baltic coastal Free City of Gdansk in 1939.\par \par \uc2 After meeting Charles, Mrs Ferguson, 78, said: "The Prince said, 'And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler'.\par \par \uc2 "I must say that I agree with him and am sure a lot of people do.\par \par \uc2 "But I was very surprised that he made the comment as I know they aren't meant to say these things.\par \par \uc2 "I told the Prince that while my family and I were lucky to get a permit to travel, many members of my relatives had permits but were unable to get out before the war broke out on September 1.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Clarence House said: "We do not comment on private conversations.

All I would say is that right now I think the behaviour of Putin is not only menacing to Ukraine but it is very destabilising for Europe more generally.\par \par \uc2 "That is why we continue to say to the Russians, continue to say to Vladimir Putin: step back, de-escalate. It's not in Russia's interests, let alone anybody else's, to continue ratcheting up this tension.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Prince is not the first to compare Putin to the Nazi dictator.\par \par \uc2 Several high-profile figures have made a link between Russian moves against Ukraine, including annexation of Crimea, and German aggression leading to World War Two.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 In March, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had to clarify remarks suggesting Putin's justification for his incursion into Crimea to protect ethnic Russians was reminiscent of claims made by Hitler over foreign territories.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "Now if this sounds familiar, it's what Hitler did back in the '30s," she said, later explaining she had not meant to make a comparison but said lessons could be learned from history.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Germany's conservative finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble also denied making similar remarks a few weeks later.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Russia dismisses such comparisons and says Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine are under threat from a Kiev government in the sway of militant Ukrainian nationalists.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Tension has been mounting in the Ukraine since a revolution in the country ousted President Viktor Yanukovych in February.\par \par \uc2 An interim President, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, was appointed and a new an interim government was formed.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Despite the government being recognised by the United States and \uc2 European Union\uc2 , Russia along with some other countries condemned it as illegitimate.\par \par \uc2 Pro-Russian forces started to appear in Crimea and a referendum was held on whether the country should become part of Russia.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The vote came back as 96 per cent in favour and the peninsular was annexed, but many cast doubts over the ballot's its legitimacy.\par \par \uc2 Russian forces took over military bases and police stations as Crimea was put under Putin's control.\par \par \uc2 Since then pro-Russian separatists have continued occupy government buildings in the south and east of the Ukraine, and have pushed for that too to be swallowed up by its neighbour.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Charles has often courted controversy by voicing strong views on the environment, architecture and social affairs. Last year it was revealed he had held 36 meetings with government ministers since Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative-led coalition took power in 2010.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140521ea5l000gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

"What is racism?" he asked.\par \par \uc2 "Is race about colour? Is race about race or is it about nationality? I made a comment there that wasn't intended to say any more than that I felt uncomfortable about the rate and pace of change.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 O'Brien cut in: "You felt uncomfortable about people speaking foreign languages, despite the fact that presumably your own wife does when she phones home to Germany."\par \par \uc2 "I don't suppose she speaks it on the train," an exasperated Farage responded.\par \par \uc2 April 2014: A month of Ukip gaffes and controversies\par \par \uc2 O'Brien then questioned Farage on his claim that he would feel uncomfortable if a group of Romanian men moved in next door, pressing him to say whether he "would feel the same about a group of German children", asking "what's the difference?"\par \par \uc2 Farge somewhat ambiguously replied: "I think you know the difference. We want an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy that is not just based on controlling not just quantity but quality".\par \par \uc2 He was also confronted over controversial comments made by his party candidates. "All anyone wants to talk about is the idiots in Ukip," Farage said. "Wherever we have found people who have had extreme, racist, unpleasant views we have unceremoniously got rid of them.\par \par \uc2 "To hold out the views of handful of people as being representative of Ukip frankly is not the truth."\par \par \uc2 Yet O\u8217\'20\'19Brien read out a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post from a Ukip candidate suggesting that "poofters" might reconsider their sexual orientation if one was made an example of and shot, which had been posted three months before.\u160\'00\'A0 In an awkward exchange, Farage was forced to admit he knew nothing about the tweet or the individual who tweeted it.\par \par \uc2 The interview was brought to a close 22 minutes in by Patrick O'Flynn, the party\u8217\'20\'19s head of communications, after Farage was accused by O'Brien of "reverse-ferretting" over a promise to have his EU expenses and allowances audited, before enquiring if Farage would be willing to sign up to a transparency arrangement used by Labour MEPS, which he had to hand in the studio.\par \par \uc2 When O\u8217\'20\'19Flynn burst into the studio and interrupted, O\u8217\'20\'19Brien explained: \u8220\'20\'1CThis is Patrick O\u8217\'20\'19Flynn, Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s Director of Communications and former political commentator on the Daily Express. Is this a friend in the media, or a member of the political class?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This came after Farage had been challenged earlier in the interview over a phrase where he discussed \u8220\'20\'1Cmembers of the political class and their friends in the media\u8221\'20\'1D. O\u8217\'20\'19Brien pointed out Farage writes columns for both The Independent and The Express, and regularly appears on Question Time.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140516ea5g002s1\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 Cameron: I totally get why people vote Ukip\b0\par\par\uc2 By TOM NEWTON DUNN, Political Editor   \par \uc2 1,119 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par 10:21\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd.

Labour and the Liberals think there is nothing wrong with Europe. Ukip thinks there is nothing right with Europe. Where most British people are is we should get in there, get a better deal for Britain and then give the British people the decision in a referendum.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: So do you think Ukip is just a protest vote?\par \par \uc2 DAVID: It is a mixture of things. It has been a tough few years in Britain with the recession. People are frustrated. I totally understand people's frustration, of course they want things to move farther and faster. What I am offering is answers, not just anger and rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: If Ukip do well they are going to be more vocal, They will be in everyone's face. How are you going to combat that Dave?\par \par \uc2 DAVID: I think by saying to people...\par \par \uc2 GRANT: Sorry, I meant Prime Minister.\par \par \uc2 DAVID: Dave is fine, Dave is fine. Look, I recognise it is tough to convince people about the significance of these elections. But when it comes to the General Election, are we going to stick to our economic plan or are we going to risk it all?\par \par \uc2 GRANT: How many EU \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  is enough? 150,000, half a million, a million?\par \par \uc2 DAVID: Of course say you are right that there is the freedom to move and work in Europe. That is true.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: ...which we can't stop. We can't. What I am saying to you David is next year we could have half a million migrants come over to work in here legally. Not on benefit but working...\par \par \uc2 DAVID: That is what Farage said.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: No but you can't though David.\par \par \uc2 DAVID: Hang on a second, he said that the entire population of Romania would come and work in Britain. Right? And he got the population wrong. He said 29 million.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: He said they could, he is right. They could.\par \par \uc2 DAVID: If you actually have sensible controls on benefit tourism, if you have an education policy and a welfare policy that works, that will help you to get net migration to this country down.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: It is going to be close next year. The last election, Labour was a complete disaster - but you still only managed to get in with a coalition. Next year it is going to be even harder.\par \par \uc2 DAVID: Yes it will be tough but it is not impossible. It is going to be a tough election, you are right, it is going to be very tough. I totally accept that. My argument is that it is doable.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: You said in the past that Ukip are all fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists. Do you think you was right in the first place?\par \par \uc2 DAVID: I don't want to go over that ground. I said that in 2006. What I am very clear about is there are a lots of decent hard working people who do not have a racist bone in their body who are thinking of voting Ukip because they are frustrated by Europe. They want to see action on welfare. They want us to sort out \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . I totally understand that. I am trying to communicate in this campaign I am on your side and I can deliver those things for you.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: Why haven't you brought in exit checks yet? You've been here four years.\par \par \uc2 DAVID: They are coming in in April next year. If the argument at the next election is you have not finished the job, I agree. We need more time to finish the job but we are making good progress. \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2 , all these things are part of my plan. That will be our pitch at the next election. We are on the right track, don't turn back.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/5635770/Lib-Dem-leader-Nick-Clegg-quizzed-by-The-Suns-cabbie.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 I spoke to Nick Clegg about your negotiations with the EU}}}\uc2  and he said to me, 'they are so small fry even I would vote them'.\par \par \uc2 DAVID: A year ago he said it is impossible and it would be the end of the world. Now he says it is easy. Clegg can't have it both ways, he can't say it is simple and it is impossible. I'm going to get another treaty.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: Not by the next parliament.\par \par \uc2 DAVID: They need the treaty change. The Germans and others need a banking union and a fiscal union, so just as they need some changes I am perfectly at liberty to say, 'All right guys, you can have some changes.' But I need some changes too.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: Michael Fallon said that if you don't get the answers you are looking for you will advocate a no vote. Is that right?\par \par \uc2 DAVID: I am an optimist. I think I will get this.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: Is he speaking for the Conservative party?\par \par \uc2 DAVID: I am speaking for the Conservative party and my view is very clearly I will achieve what I want to achieve.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: How much in Euros would a glass of your favourite red wine be in Brussels?\par \par \uc2 DAVID: That is not what I do in Brussels. Sometimes I don't even go out of the room for a pee because you are worried the rebate will have gone by the time you get back.\par \par \uc2 GRANT: How much would you pay for a pint of milk in Brussels if you were making a cup of tea for the fellas?\par \par \uc2 DAVID: I would reckon you would pay about 49 pence in Britain so if you do that in Euros I think you are probably looking at about 75 cents.\par \par \uc2 I expected more from \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 . It felt like spin, spin and more spin. Are the negotiations he's looking for going to make any difference? I don't think so.\par \par \uc2 None of the leaders have jumped off the page at me to be honest. Even now I don't know who I'm going to vote for, but I'm veering towards Ukip as a protest.\par \par \uc2 Join the debate on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  @ #SunCab {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK

scoured almost 3,000 square miles since resuming their search.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 US Coast Guard\uc2  initially called off its search for the missing men on Sunday after spending two days hunting for the capsized vessel, the 40ft Cheeki Rafiki.\par \par \uc2 But it decided to resume its efforts after pressure from the \uc2 UK Government\uc2 , the families of the crew, figures from across the

launch a stinging attack on Labour and Ukip, warning they are threatening the political consensus in place since Thatcherism that Britain should be an open market economy.\par \par \uc2 The Chancellor will say that since the fall of the Berlin Wall, governments have championed free trade and welcomed foreign investment, a situation now threatened by \u8220\'20\'1Cparties on the left and populist right\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 In a speech to the CBI, Mr Osborne will apparently take aim at Opposition policies such as an energy price freeze and indexing the minimum wage to average earnings,

periods in its history.\par \par \uc2 Steve Williams, who will step down after the conference, will address the Federation\u8217\'20\'19s annual conference in Bournemouth after a year in which the staff association has suffered huge damage to its reputation.\par \par \uc2 The behaviour of Federation representatives in the wake of the so-called Plebgate row involving former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell led to severe criticism of the organisation\u8217\'20\'19s agenda.\par \par \uc2 CONCERNS OVER ONLINE EXTREMISM\par \par \uc2 Fears have been raised about online extremism a year after the death of soldier Lee Rigby, as jihadist material remains widely available online.\par \par \uc2 The young soldier was mown down in a car and hacked to death on May 22 last year by Muslim fanatics Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, prompting a Government taskforce to propose greater powers to block access to extremist websites.\par \par \uc2 Material from US-born radical Anwar al-Awlaki was seized from both men\u8217\'20\'19s houses, and is available on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , something highlighted by MP Keith Vaz last year.\par \par \uc2 FRAUD TRIAL CHALLENGE RULING DUE\par \par \uc2 Leading judges give their ruling today on a challenge against a decision to throw out a multimillion-pound fraud trial after defendants said they could not get representation because of cuts to legal aid.\par \par \uc2 They have been urged to overturn a judge\u8217\'20\'19s ruling made at London\u8217\'20\'19s Southwark Crown Court after the Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s brother, Alexander Cameron QC, successfully argued that the case should be halted because controversial Ministry of Justice reforms meant the five defendants could not find barristers of \u8220\'20\'1Csufficient competence\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Judge Anthony Leonard stayed the proceedings on May 1, but City watchdog the \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  (FCA) recently challenged his decision at the Court of Appeal.\par \par \uc2 COURT TO RULE OVER SEAGULL CULLING\par \par \uc2 The High Court is ruling on a legal challenge over Government backing for the culling of thousands of seagulls.\par \par

for legal reasons, faces a single count of child neglect in connection with the discovery of the infant, named Baby Jade by hospital staff.\par \par \uc2 It is alleged that the baby was abandoned \u8220\'20\'1Cin a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health\u8221\'20\'1D in the Stechford area of Birmingham in October last year.\par \par \uc2 INQUEST INTO

\par\par \b \uc2 Ukip and SNP share a common goal as they vie for seat\b0\par\par\uc2 Allan Massie   \par \uc2 1,085 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par \uc2 The Scotsman\par \uc2 SC\par \uc2 1\par 26\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014   \par \par \uc2 If THE polls are right, the Liberal Democrats will lose their Scottish seat in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 . This would be a pity, first because the Lib Dems are resolutely good Europeans - a thought that may persuade some Scots who also approve of the EU to switch their vote to them at the last moment; second because, as Willis Pickard, a former features editor of The Scotsman, pointed out in a letter yesterday, George Lyon has been an effective MEP. But there it is. Everyone knows that politics is a rough old game. The Lib Dems' decision to enter into a coalition with the Conservatives to give us five years of stable government at a critical time has evidently cooked their goose in Scotland.\par \par \uc2 So we are left with the SNP claiming it is between them and Ukip for this last Scottish seat, which may or may not be true but is an interesting prospect. The two parties have much in common, even though for many the SNP presents the acceptable face of nationalism, Ukip the unacceptable one. The SNP is pro-European and asserts that an independent Scotland would be admitted as a member state of the EU with no difficulty, even continuing to benefit from the opt-outs from European law negotiated by British Conservative and Labour governments. Ukip, on the other hand, calls for Britain to leave the EU.\par \par \uc2 The SNP parades its inclusive credentials - nobody is barred from membership on account of ethnicity or religion, and \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  recently visited a mosque in support of the SNP candidate, Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh. Ukip in contrast is discriminatingly xenophobic, if not racist - and, bizarrely, the Ukip candidate here, David Coburn, condemned Mr Salmond's visit to the mosque as "sectarian", thus giving, in the eyes of some of us, further substance to David Cameron's view that Ukip is full of "fruitcakes".\par \par \uc2 Moreover, while \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  is the best-known and arguably most popular politician in Scotland, respected even by many who will vote No on 18 September, the Ukip leader Nigel Farage is met with angry protest whenever he crosses the old Anglo-Scottish Border, though in parts of England he is hugely admired.\par \par \uc2 The SNP is a coherent, disciplined and well-established party with a long history behind it. The wild men were eliminated or sidelined a long time ago, even if some of the intemperate and nasty internet posts by the so-called cybernats might seem to suggest otherwise. Ukip has nothing like the SNP's history, and is scarcely an organised party at all. Its policies are utterly incoherent and it appears to have very little control over its candidates and councillors, who frequently express views that may embarrass even the embarrassing Mr Farage. It is a sort of ragbag party which attracts all sorts of resentful people who profess to love Britain but often evidently hate the country it is now.\par \par \uc2 Yet, simply because both are nationalist parties, they have essential things in common. Even a civic and respectable nationalism like the SNP's must identify and oppose the Other who is in some way oppressing or holding back the nation. Mr Salmond has sensibly and sincerely steered his party away from anglophobia, from identifying the English as the enemy. Indeed he proclaims himself, again sincerely, to be an Anglophile and insists that if we vote for independence the "social union" between Scotland and England will survive and we will be good neighbours to each other. He might be right in the long run, though in the short term it's quite likely that there would be tears, tantrums and a great deal of bitterness. Divorces are rarely wholly amicable.\par \par \uc2 But if the SNP is not anti-English (though some who vote for it may be that), it nevertheless had to identify the Other - the oppressor and focus of discontent. It found it in Westminster, in the UK political system and the British political parties, all of which, even their Scottish wings, stood in the way of Scotland's aspirations. Westminster was broken or - the fashionable word - dysfunctional. Westminster politicians, both Conservative and Labour, had post-imperial ambitions which Scotland had discarded. Westminster was corrupt. The contrast was made between Westminster vice and Holyrood virtue. Only by freeing ourselves from the post-imperial delusion that the UK was still a great power with a role to play in world affairs could Scotland fulfil its potential. Moreover, there was often a Tory government in Westminster, and this was clearly a bad thing.\par \par \uc2 It is in its hostility to Westminster and the political class there that Ukip is at one with the SNP. Ukip's founding purpose was to get the UK out of the EU - though, amusingly, it is only the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , elected by the un-British system of proportional representation from a party list, that has given Ukip an opportunity and a degree of credibility. Nigel Farage has a certain standing because he is a member of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 . Nevertheless, though Ukip is hoovering up an anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  vote, it is evident that many who will vote for the party on Thursday are animated by their loathing of the political class, of what they call the ConLibLab consensus, which has treacherously taken their country away from them.\par \par \uc2 If Ukip stresses its British identity and the SNP would like to dispense with that, both parties are fuelled by the same sort of discontent with things as they are. Ukip would put the "Great" back into Britain, while the SNP would remove it, but both parties share the belief that the UK state in its present form is profoundly unsatisfactory, unresponsive to their legitimate interests. Of course they are not the same: the SNP's goal is credible and capable of being achieved; Ukip's wish to turn the clock back and restore the Britain of a generation or two ago is an exercise in fantasy. Ukip's frame of mind is therefore in the exact sense of the word hopeless, while the SNP will insist that it offers hope of a better future.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless the two parties have one other thing in common: a lack of confidence in the people they claim to represent. Ukip believes the UK cannot flourish in the EU; the SNP that Scotland cannot flourish in the UK. They are both, as it happens, wrong - the evidence is against them.\par \par \uc2 Document SC00000020140521ea5l00019\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw157\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2355\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Voting SNP keeps Ukip out of Scotland, urges Ewing\b0\par\par\uc2 Tom Peterkin   \par \uc2 889 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par \uc2 The Scotsman\par \uc2 SC\par \uc2 1\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014   \par \par \uc2 The veteran Nationalist Winnie Ewing yesterday joined the SNP's drive to keep Scotland a Ukip-free zone.\par \par \uc2 The matriarch of the SNP's best-known dynasty made her first intervention in the European parliamentary election campaign when she urged voters to vote SNP to keep out the anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  party.\par \par \uc2 Opinion polls have suggested Ukip's chances of winning a Scottish seat might depend on whether the SNP manages to increase its European representation from two seats to three. On that basis, \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2 's party has argued that the electorate faces a straight choice between the SNP and Nigel Farage's party.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Ewing, 84, the heroine of the 1967 by-election who was known as Madame Ecosse when she sat in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , lent her support to Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, the candidate hoping to join the SNP's Ian Hudghton, 62, an MEP since 1998, and Alyn Smith, 40, an MEP since 2004.\par \par \uc2 "As the SNP's first woman parliamentarian - and the party's first ever Euro-MP - I fervently hope that Tasmina will become our newest in Thursday's election," Mrs Ewing said.\par \par \uc2 "It is very clear that the choice is between Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh and Nigel Farage's Ukip for Scotland's sixth seat, and I am in no doubt that the vast majority of people in Scotland - regardless of how they might vote in other elections - would prefer the progressive politics and forward-looking vision of Tasmina.\par \par \uc2 "If elected, Tasmina will be a strong voice for Scotland and the many diverse communities which make up our modern nation. I urge people to vote for her on Thursday."\par \par \uc2 Ms Ahmed-Sheikh said: "If I am elected on Thursday I am determined to follow in Winnie Ewing's footsteps by being a strong voice for Scotland in Europe and standing up for the needs and priorities of people in Scotland at every turn."\par \par \uc2 Six seats in Scotland are up for grabs.\par \par \uc2 The SNP is expected to emerge as the largest party, with Mr Hudghton and Mr Smith being returned to the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Labour's sitting MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler are also expected to be elected.\par \par \uc2 George Lyon, of the Lib Dems, faces a struggle to be returned to the European parliament.\par \par \uc2 And Ukip could eat into Conservative support for Dr Ian Duncan, who is hoping to replace Struan Stevenson as the party's European representative.\par \par \uc2 A rise in Ukip support could also thwart the SNP's ambitions to win a third seat for Ms Ahmed-Sheikh, a mother of four who is a past winner of Scotland's Asian businesswoman of the year award.\par \par \uc2 The polls would suggest Ukip faces an uphill battle to secure that 12 per cent of the vote that would put it within sight of Strasbourg.\par \par \uc2 But the SNP is taking no chances, launching a series of attacks on Mr Farage's party.\par \par \uc2 Should Ukip upset the odds and return David Coburn, the candidate at the top of its list in Scotland, it would be a blow to the SNP's narrative that Scotland and England are travelling down diverging political paths.\par \par \uc2 Opinion polls suggested Ukip is in line to be the largest party south of the Border, beating Labour and the Conservatives into second and third place respectively.\par \par \uc2 A series of gaffes have marred Mr Farage's campaign, including a radio interview in which he struggled to explain why he felt "uncomfortable" hearing foreign languages on trains.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, the last TNS poll before the European elections showed that Ukip is leading Labour by three points UK-wide ahead of tomorrow's vote.\par \par \uc2 According to TNS, the recent negative coverage of Ukip and Nigel Farage seems to have had an impact and the projected vote share for Ukip has fallen by five points from 36 per cent to 31 per cent since 30 April. Labour is second on 28 per cent, with the Tories in third place with 21 per cent - up three points since April.\par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrats are a distant fourth, with 7 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, Mr Salmond stepped up his attacks on Ukip when he responded to a claim by Mr Coburn that the First Minister had been using "sectarian" campaign tactics.\par \par \uc2 Mr Coburn's comment was made after Mr Salmond visited a mosque on the election trail last week. Mr Coburn claimed that if he had made a similar visit to a venue such as a Roman Catholic cathedral, he would have faced the same accusation.\par \par \uc2 Mr Salmond said: "Attacking a visit to a mosque illustrates perfectly why it is so important that we stop Ukip in their tracks - and we have that opportunity in Scotland on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "The diversity of modern Scotland is a strength and a source of enrichment to our whole society. It is something to be celebrated - as we do across the political spectrum in Scotland - and is the antithesis of the backward-looking, insular and intolerant politics of Ukip."\par \par \uc2 Last night, Mr Coburn said: "Scotland has been plagued with sectarianism as we all know and we have done our best to avoid any of that nonsense, and we have steered clear of any houses of religion. Quite frankly, it is not an appropriate place to be recruiting."\par \par \uc2 Document SC00000020140521ea5l0000r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw59\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal885\pichgoal600

But something has changed. The polling over the last week shows that of those who intend to vote for us tomorrow, 60 per cent of those intend to vote for us at the general election too."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage insisted his campaign, which descended into farce on Tuesday as a carnival-themed rally in Croydon, south London fell apart amid protests against the party's stance on race and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , had not been badly organised. "We were the only party that had actually reached the voters before the postal votes arrived," he said.\par \par \uc2 The "carnival rally" added to a difficult final week of campaigning for the party leader, who apologised earlier in the week after an awkward interview on LBC radio in which he was accused of being racist towards Romanian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ukip's aggressive stance on race and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has won the party new supporters, however, including from those on the left and people who have not voted for years. Mr Farage told the BBC: "The majority of our voters are not Conservative voters. We are picking up big lumps of Labour support. Turnouts tomorrow will be the highest we've ever seen for a European election."\par \par \uc2 The final European opinion polls by TNS, Opinium and Survation all show Ukip ahead of Labour by between 2 and 5 percentage points. Meanwhile, the Guardian reported on Wednesday that internal polling by Labour and the Conservatives show attacks on Mr Farage for being racist have only helped cement his reputation among voters as the anti-establishment candidate.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage will continue to target disaffected Labour voters over the next year, and he told the BBC that his main priority is to force Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, to change his party's opposition to holding a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.\par \par \uc2 If that happens, the Ukip leader said, he would be willing to sign a parliamentary pact with Labour following next year's election. "I would do a deal post the next election with anyone," he said. "I would do a deal with the devil if it got us a referendum."\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140521ea5l0018h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Survey results come as Osborne says 'pessimistic' Labour and Ukip 'want to pull up the drawbridge and shut Britain off from the world'\par \par \uc2 A surge in support for Ukip, fuelled by anger over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  levels, has hit Tory and Labour efforts to win over the crucial voters who will decide next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election result, according to a survey.\par \par \uc2 The ComRes poll, which underlines Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s destabilising impact on Westminster\u8217\'20\'19s established parties, comes as political leaders began a final round of campaigning ahead of Thursday's European and local elections.\par \par \uc2 Ukip has set itself the target of winning the most votes in the Euro elections, while Labour will be hoping to pick up hundreds of council seats across England.\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are both braced for losses in what threatens to be a gloomy set of contests for the Coalition partners. The Cabinet yesterday agreed the final details of a Queen\u8217\'20\'19s Speech programme to be set out on 4 June in an effort to demonstrate the Coalition has not run out of steam.\par \par \uc2 The ComRes survey, in the 40 most marginal Labour-Tory constituencies in Britain, found a small swing to Labour in the seats likely to define the general election\u8217\'20\'19s outcome.\par \par \uc2 It put Labour on 35 per cent (down two points since the last election), two ahead of the Conservatives on 33 per cent (down four).\par \par \uc2 Ukip is riding high on 17 per cent, more than four times its election performance of just three per cent in those constituencies.\par \par \uc2 The poll found that 44 per cent of voters named controlling \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as among their top priorities \u8211\'20\'13 and that Ukip was judged the party most trusted on the issue.\par \par \uc2 The current strong showing for Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party suggests there is still everything to play for in the most marginal seats.\par \par \uc2 Both Labour and the Tories are pouring vast resources into the constituencies on the grounds that shifting affiliations among a few thousand voters could make all the difference in a close-fought election. The success of attempts to woo back Ukip-leaning voters over the next year could be crucial to success or failure.\par \par \uc2 The findings reinforce suggestions that the local elections are among the most unpredictable in recent political history.\par \par \uc2 Labour will be looking to make steady gains in London and metropolitan boroughs, and to show it can reach out to voters in Southern councils such as Crawley and Swindon.\par \par \uc2 It needs to perform strongly as the last time the councils were contested was at the nadir of the party\u8217\'20\'19s unpopularity under Gordon Brown.\par \par \uc2 The Tories, who have the most councillors in Britain, will be attempting to fend off Labour advances in Northern and Midlands town halls including Trafford and Amber Valley. They are also aiming to capture Kingston-upon-Thames in South-West London from the Liberal Democrats.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems are engaged in damage limitation, hoping to keep net losses relatively small and to show they can hang on in councils where they are established.\par \par \uc2 Ukip, meanwhile, are expected to make around 100 gains, although the party will be keeping the champagne on ice for the European election results, which will be declared on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to the CBI tomorrow, the Chancellor George Osborne will accuse Labour and Ukip of having a \u8220\'20\'1Cdeeply pessimistic anti-business agenda\u8221\'20\'1D. He will say: \u8220\'20\'1CPolitical parties on the left and the populist right have this in common: they want to pull up the drawbridge and shut Britain off from the world.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 ComRes interviewed a representative sample of 1,030 adults living in the 40 most marginal constituencies where the Conservatives and Labour shared first and second place the last election. Data were also weighted by past vote recall.\par \par \uc2 Good night/bad night: What do the parties want to achieve?\par \par \uc2 Labour\par \par \uc2 Good night: Winning the most votes and gaining more than 300 seats. Signs of progress in parts of the country \u8211\'20\'13 such as the south-east \u8211\'20\'13 currently immune to the party\u8217\'20\'19s charms.\par \par \uc2 Bad night: Fewer than 200 gains would suggest Labour is failing to achieve the traction it needs to propel Ed Miliband into Downing Street next May.\par \par \uc2 Tories\par \par \uc2 Good night: Maintaining their losses below 200 seats would be welcome news, suggesting Ukip is having less impact than the party feared. Winning Kingston-upon-Thames.\par \par \uc2 Bad night: Losing more than 300 of the 1,600 seats they are defending would show their support remains anaemic. The loss of Trafford would leave them without any Northern metropolitan authority.\par \par \uc2 Ukip\par \par \uc2 Good night: Making around 100 gains would show they are reaching into urban areas not noted for Ukip sympathies. Gaining a foothold on London authorities\par \par \uc2 Bad night: Precious few gains would underline accusations that the party\u8217\'20\'19s appeal is patchy and largely limited to the shires and suburbs.\par \par \uc2 Lberal Democrats\par \par \uc2 Good night: 200 losses would come as a relief given the party\u8217\'20\'19s parlous standing in the polls. Defending seats in areas such as Kingston, Sutton and Westmoreland where they are dug in.\par \par \uc2 Bad night: The loss of another 400 seats would be a fresh bodyblow to morale, especially if they are ousted from power in Kingston.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140520ea5l005em\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 British politics in centre of gravity says Farage\b0\par\par\uc2 MACER HALL   \par \uc2 1,286 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Express\par \uc2 THEEXP\par \uc2 1; National\par 4,5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Express Newspapers   \par \par \uc2 INTERVIEW\par \par \uc2 NIGEL Farage predicted last night that his UK Independence Party is heading for a spectacular victory in tomorrow's European elections \u8211\'20\'13 and warned it will "shift the centre of gravity" in British politics.\par \par \uc2 Millions of voters will back the anti\u8211\'20\'13Brussels party, not to protest but because "that is the feeling in their hearts," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader has vowed his "people's army" will defy a series of attacks and slurs to top the poll.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said: "I think we are going to win. And I think the implications for the other three party leaders are pretty major.\par \par \uc2 "I seriously think it could lead to the demise of Nick Clegg."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage brushed aside recent polls suggesting support for his party has been slipping over the last weeks of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 He said: "I said three years ago we would win these elections, to much ridicule. I set the bar high. Was it a gamble? Yes. But you know what? We only live once."\par \par \uc2 He admitted the recent flurry of accusations that he and his party are racist had been "very hurtful".\par \par \uc2 "The establishment have clubbed together, they are terrified of us," he said. "We are absolutely not a racist party in any way at all; never have been and never will be.\par \par \uc2 "I think, ironically, it has made those who support us even more likely to stick with us in subsequent elections."\par \par \uc2 COST OF LIVING\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said that Labour leader Ed Miliband had correctly identified the crippling rise in the cost of living as the key issue for millions of families.\par \par \uc2 But he had come up with the wrong solution to the problem.\par \par \uc2 He added: "The normal aspirations that families have are disappearing. I mean the prospect of buying houses, even the option of getting social housing.\par \par \uc2 "The prospects of many youngsters to actually find work at all.\par \par \uc2 "For those in work, it's a matter of declining income against rising energy prices and everything else.\par \par \uc2 "Labour are right to have identi\u8211\'20\'13fied the problem. But they have no solutions to offer whatsoever. And the EU thing fits into all this.\par \par \uc2 "These Brussels energy commitments mean the average consumer's bill by 2020 will have a 20 per cent surcharge on it. We want to bring down energy prices, we want to bring down food prices.\par \par \uc2 "And we want to find a way in which our 4.8 million men and women who run small businesses as sole traders can be given the incentive to take more people off the unemployment register and put them into work."\par \par \uc2 HEALTH\par \par \uc2 Successful business leaders need to be recruited to run the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and root out billions of pounds of wasteful spending, Mr Farage said.\par \par \uc2 He explained: "We seem to base our debate on the \uc2 NHS\uc2 , through the Labour years and the Cameron years, on how much we spend, not what value for money we're getting. So we will make in our manifesto an absolute commitment to healthcare, free at the point of access. But we will equally say we are not getting value for money. It is astonishing how much money is wasted on bureaucracy and failed IT systems.\par \par \uc2 "We would advocate a much more business\u8211\'20\'13like approach: put somebody in charge from a big commercial organisation."\par \par \uc2 SCHOOLS\par \par \uc2 Public funds should be used to send bright youngsters from less well\u8211\'20\'13off backgrounds to the top private schools, the Ukip leader said.\par \par \uc2 "We want a radical change in our education system," he insisted.\par \par \uc2 "There is an absolute refusal from our public\u8211\'20\'13school educated middle class to allow that same opportunity to the kids of average voters. We haven't written the manifesto, but you will see a commitment to selective education.\par \par \uc2 "You will see a commitment to grammar schools and to the return of the assisted places scheme.\par \par \uc2 "I was at a private school with lots of kids whose places were paid through local authorities.\par \par \uc2 "It gave them amazing opportunities in life. It was a great scheme. "Eddie George went to my school, his dad was a postman \u8211\'20\'13 and he went on to become governor of the Bank of England."\par \par \b \uc2 IMMIGRATION\b0 \par \par \uc2 Mr Farage was unapologetic for raising concerns about migrants from Romania.\par \par \uc2 He has been criticised for saying people have "concerns" about the idea of living next door to "a group of Romanian men."\par \par \uc2 But yesterday he insisted: "I in no way want to give the impression that it would be right or moral to discriminate against Romanians. I do not.\par \par \uc2 "But I have a huge problem with Romania.\par \par \uc2 "It's a post\u8211\'20\'13communist country that has not made the full transition to a Western democracy.\par \par \uc2 "The country is in the grip of organised crime and I don't want that crime on the streets of London or anyone else in the UK.\par \par \uc2 "I've spoken to the boys at Dover \u8211\'20\'13 the police, the Border Agency \u8211\'20\'13 and they are tearing their hair out because they don't have the ability to do anything about it."\par \par \uc2 Referring to the strong Ukip performance he expects in tomorrow's European election vote, he added: "I think it will mark the shifting of the centre of gravity in our politics.\par \par \uc2 "It won't be good enough anymore for Labour and the Tories to say we must have controlled migration when it is perfectly obvious that we don't."\par \par \uc2 PROTEST VOTE\par \par \uc2 Millions of people planning to vote Ukip on Thursday will not simply be registering a protest vote \u8211\'20\'13 but will be acting out of belief that the party is "on their side", Mr Farage said.\par \par \uc2 He insisted: "We are attracting a very large number of people who would not have voted in these European elections. The standard protest in a European election used to be to stay at home.\par \par \uc2 "We have got people out there who have never voted in their lives going out to vote Ukip on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "The use of the word protest is a self\u8211\'20\'13defence mechanism for the political class. They did it after Eastleigh.\par \par \uc2 "Yes, there will many voters who vote Ukip because it is a European election.\par \par \uc2 "But there will be many more who vote Ukip because that is the feeling in their heart.\par \par \uc2 "They believe in us because we're on their side."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage also revealed that he will take more of backseat role after the euro elections and focus on his job as an MEP.\par \par \uc2 And he promised that work will soon begin on a new Ukip election manifesto that will widen the party's appeal.\par \par \uc2 He plans to appoint a string of senior spokesmen and women who will become the new faces of Ukip in the months ahead \u8211\'20\'13 tasked with demolishing accusations that the party is a one\u8211\'20\'13man band.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader also insisted that he personally was coping with the intense pressure of round\u8211\'20\'13the\u8211\'20\'13clock campaigning.\par \par \uc2 He said: "I am doing remarkably well, considering. I'm pretty tough.\par \par \uc2 "That's not to say there haven't been reflective moments when I haven't considered my position.\par \par \uc2 "But they have never lasted long because I absolutely believe in what I am doing."\par \par \uc2 OPINION: PAGE 12\par \par \uc2 'People believe in their hearts that Ukip is on their side'\par \par \uc2 QDo you think it is important for Britain to quit the EU?

We now have to tell people in foreign languages what the law is.\par \par \uc2 "Dealing with foreign enclaves puts a strain on services. Creating special signs for the Polish community will cost the police money they can ill afford."\par \par \uc2 West Mercia Police say the signs are part of Operation Spartacus which has slashed alcohol-related antisocial behaviour since it was launched last October.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman said: "If we can educate people rather than reprimand them, then that is something we would rather do." ? A city suburb swamped by Roma \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  exploded in violence after a mass brawl broke out following months of simmering tension between ethnic groups.\par \par \uc2 At least one youth was taken to hospital when rival gangs clashed in Sheffield on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140521ea5l0004v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

He said: "Inevitably in a set of elections people want to send some messages to the Government about issues they are frustrated about.\par \par \uc2 "I don't only share those frustrations, I'm acting on them. We are the only party that has a clear plan for dealing with \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , reforming our relationship with Europe, keeping our economy on track."\par \par \uc2 But he conceded: "I think in many ways the referendum pledge will have its greatest relevance at the time of the next election when people will be choosing, do you want to have the Conservatives, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , continuing with a longterm economic plan that's turning the country around and an in-out referendum? "Or do you want Labour - that will tax, spend and borrow - or do you want another party that could risk not having a long-term economic plan and referendum?" He rejected Deputy PM Nick Clegg's claim that it was unpatriotic to want to leave the EU because it would damage the economy. Mr Cameron said it was possible either to want to stay in or leave the EU and be patriotic.\par \par \uc2 He said: "Your patriotism isn't defined by your position on this question. Your patriotism is defined by your love of your country, its institutions, its history, what it can do in the world."\par \par \uc2 He believed Britain would maximise its influence if it achieved reform which recognised its wish for a relationship based on trade and cooperation - and other EU leaders were starting to echo his points.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140521ea5l0004t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 CHARLES AZNAVOUR Happy 90th to the Gallic golden oldie\b0\par\par\uc2 Neil Clark   \par \uc2 1,174 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Express\par \uc2 THEEXP\par \uc2 1; National\par 33\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Express Newspapers   \par \par \uc2 Since his career began in 1933 the singer has sold over 100 million records but shows no signs of slowing down as he celebrates his landmark birthday\par \par \uc2 WHEN Charles Aznavour first appeared on stage in a play at the age of nine Adolf Hitler had just become chancellor of Germany, Ramsay MacDonald was the British prime minister and the average wage in the UK was \u163\'00\'A33.60 a week.\par \par \uc2 The legendary singer who is 90 tomorrow has been wooing audiences for an incredible 81 years in a career stretching back to 1933.\par \par \uc2 Moreover the man who has been labelled the Frank Sinatra of France and who makes our very own Sir Bruce Forsyth look like a spring chicken, shows no signs of slowing down. Only last October he sang at London's Royal Albert Hall and his performance earned outstanding reviews.\par \par \uc2 Aznavour is the man of 1,000 songs. He wrote his first in 1941 when the Nazis were occupying Paris. But for British music lovers he is probably most associated with two tracks from the mid\u8211\'20\'131970s, The Old Fashioned Way and the beautiful ballad She that topped the charts for four weeks in the summer of 1974 and which has been covered by many others.\par \par \uc2 Aznavour has enjoyed a glittering career but had to overcome disadvantages. Born Shahnour Aznavurjan in Paris on May 22, 1924, his parents were \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who had escaped the Armenian genocide carried out by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 in which more than one million people died.\par \par \uc2 His family was poor and young Charles with his parents, sister and grandmother lived in a one\u8211\'20\'13room flat in Paris's Latin quarter. Aznavour, who said he was brought up in an atmosphere of "love, music and poverty", attended his first stage audition at nine and landed a part in Emil And The Detectives. At 10 he was singing in nightclubs.\par \par \uc2 But in 1940 his father's Armenian restaurant closed following the German occupation of Paris and Aznavour took to selling newspapers in the street. "I became the best newspaper caller on the boulevards," he recalled. Aznavour's height \u8211\'20\'13 he was only 5ft 3in \u8211\'20\'13 and his \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  background were also disadvantages for a career as a chansonnier but his wonderful voice could not be silenced.\par \par \uc2 His big break came in the postwar years when he met the great French singer Edith Piaf. The woman known as The Little Sparrow took Aznavour under her wing, gave him advice and helped to push along his career. "I learned from her all you have to know in our profession," he admitted.\par \par \uc2 THE pair lived together for a while in the 1950s but although Aznavour described their relationship as "amorous" he always denied it was sexual. He may not have slept with Piaf but Aznavour's reputation as a ladies' man grew and he earned himself the nickname of Love Pixie, a reference to his romantic nature and his diminutive stature.\par \par \uc2 One of his most famous lovers was a young Liza Minnelli, whom he met in New York and who followed him on a tour of Canada. "The first time I saw him perform I don't remember breathing for two hours," Minnelli said. But while Aznavour said of Minnelli, "She had the ability to love fantastically," he has never been keen to reveal too much about his relationships with other women.\par \par \uc2 "Of course I had some love affairs\u8230\'20\'26 But I will never talk about that. I am a very discreet man," he told an interviewer on his 80th birthday. He has been married three times and fathered six children. "The first, I was too young, the second, I was too stupid," he declared.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with the Daily Express in 2005 he described his second wife Evelyn, whom he married in 1956, as "flashy". He also showed he was wary of women sleeping with him because of his name. "I don't like a woman who thinks she can be a star just because she has slept in my bed. I always dropped them. "\par \par \uc2 By the mid 1950s, encouraged by Piaf to interpret his own love songs, Aznavour became established as a leading French solo performer. He worked hard, sometimes performing three shows a day but he played hard too. "I've been a good drinker," " he said many years later. "I used to go out every night and I smoked four packets of cigarettes a day."\par \par \uc2 His song La Mamma topped the French charts for 12 weeks in 1963 but it was a bittersweet year for him as in October Edith Piaf died of liver cancer at the early age of 47.\par \par \uc2 In the 1960s and 1970s leading French singers enjoyed international appeal. Aznavour's compatriot Sacha Distel was a regular on British television and had a hit with Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head. Gilbert Becaud, nicknamed Monsieur 100,000 Volts, made the Top 10 in 1975 with A Little Love And Understanding. Aznavour performed in Britain for the first time at the Royal Albert Hall in 1967 and seven years later enjoyed his biggest hit She, which was written for the television series Seven Faces Of Woman. She was not a hit in France but it helped make him a household name in Britain. It also led to him being the butt of jokes from comedy troupe The Goodies who dubbed him Charles Aznovoice.\par \par \uc2 Aznavour not only wrote and performed his own songs but also acted in more than 60 films. This was despite him once bemoaning that he was "too small, too ugly" to make it in movies. In 1998 CNN and readers of Time magazine chose Aznavour as the entertainer of the century, ahead of Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. A whole new generation was introduced to She when it was used as the theme song for 1999 film Notting Hill and sung by Elvis Costello.\par \par \uc2 AZNAVOUR is as busy as ever in the 21st century. Though he sowed his wild oats when younger he has admitted mellowing since marrying third wife, Swedish\u8211\'20\'13born Ulla in 1968. "I don't have mistresses. My kids don't take drugs. I don't gamble," he told an interviewer in 2000.\par \par \uc2 As he celebrates his 90th birthday with a concert in Berlin it's worth reflecting that Aznavour provides us with one of the last links with pre\u8211\'20\'13Second World War entertainment. The good news is there's no sign of the Gallic golden oldie retiring just yet. He told a German newspaper this week, "Being on stage gives you wings" and put down the secret of his youth to having plenty for lunch but eating only a light evening meal.\par \par \uc2 He has also said that his ambition is to live until he is 120.\par \par \uc2 Fingers crossed then that Charles Aznavour \u8211\'20\'13 the last surviving great 20th\u8211\'20\'13century French chansonnier \u8211\'20\'13 will be singing in the old\u8211\'20\'13fashioned way and delighting his millions of fans for many years to come.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140521ea5l00027\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

Across the country polling stations are open from 7am to 10pm for selecting the 73 politicians the UK will send to the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , the only directly\u8211\'20\'13elected body in the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Crosses marked in pencil on ballot papers here make up just a small part of a vast political process throughout this week in which up to 400 million citizens in 28 countries are eligible to vote.\par \par \uc2 In terms of sheer scale this is a breathtaking enterprise. Yet for all that the result will be a 751\u8211\'20\'13strong assembly that is seen as utterly detached from the lives of citizens in Britain and across the continent.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  is a preposterous institution. Its ludicrous existence is neatly summed up by the farce of its monthly flit between Brussels and Strasbourg at an annual cost of more than \u163\'00\'A3130million.\par \par \uc2 For all the trappings of accountability the assembly is just one part of a bloated and out\u8211\'20\'13of\u8211\'20\'13touch bureaucracy that has been eating away at our national sovereignty and burdening our businesses with regulations and red tape for decades.\par \par \uc2 In the five years since the last EU elections Members of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  [MEPs] have postured and gorged on the gravy train while the eurozone economic crisis has condemned millions of citizens to unemployment.\par \par \uc2 The Daily Express has always been a champion of democratic institutions and representative government. It is for that very reason that this newspaper wishes tomorrow's election was not happening at all, at least as far as this country is concerned.\par \par \uc2 The EU is an outdated customs union that Britain should not belong to. Today's poll is being held to elect politicians who should have no right to meddle in the affairs of a free and independent nation state.\par \par \uc2 Each MEP elected this week will cost British taxpayers \u163\'00\'A31.79million a year, three times the cost of a Westminster MP.\par \par \uc2 Our loyal army of readers has supported the Daily Express's crusade for Britain to quit the EU for many years. As far as Brussels is concerned the vote that really counts will come when the people of this country finally win the in\u8211\'20\'13or\u8211\'20\'13out referendum on the UK's EU membership that they have so long demanded.\par \par \uc2 Yet for the desire to leave this failing European bloc your vote tomorrow can still make a difference to this country's future.\par \par \uc2 Although it is not a sovereign body the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  is growing in power and is expected to expand its reach over the next five years as European leaders press ahead with closer monetary union and economic cooperation within the eurozone.\par \par \uc2 SINCE 2009 the assembly has passed 871 legislative acts and voted 23,551 times on 19,213 amendments to 2,790 legal texts. The language may be arcane but many of those decisions will lead to regulations that affect the daily lives of millions of Britons.\par \par \uc2 Only once every five years do the citizens of this country get the chance to send a direct message to the EU's ruling elite. Millions are yearning to vent their frustration with Brussels as well as making a protest against the political establishment at Westminster.\par \par \uc2 And across Europe up to a third of votes being cast this week are expected to go to parties hostile to the EU.\par \par \uc2 It is vital that voters who want to preserve what independence Britain still retains elect MEPs who will stand up for the idea of the nation state against the trans\u8211\'20\'13national behemoth of Brussels.\par \par \uc2 The question of which party Eurosceptic voters should back tomorrow is a tough call although it is clear whom they should rule out.\par \par \uc2 Labour and the Lib Dems are fully committed to the European federalist dream of "ever\u8211\'20\'13closer union". Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg appears to be on course for a deserved electoral hiding after declaring the Lib Dems "the party of in" when it comes to the EU.\par \par \uc2 And like him Labour leader Ed Miliband has repeatedly twisted and turned over the issue of giving British voters an in\u8211\'20\'13or\u8211\'20\'13out EU referendum. Neither party can be trusted to stand up for Britain in the EU. But many voters who ultimately want a referendum as a stage towards a British exit from the EU will be divided over whether to back the Tories or the UK Independence Party tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 Under the irrepressible Nigel Farage the clamorous Ukip insurgency has electrified the election campaign and frightened the complacent Westminster establishment. The Ukip leader has been an articulate voice for Britain's withdrawal from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and has quite rightly put the issue of unrestricted \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from other EU countries on the political agenda.\par \par \uc2 And yet the campaign has also exposed some of the anti\u8211\'20\'13Brussels party's deficiencies. Ukip still has some way to go to become a mature political party rather than a ramshackle protest movement.\par \par \uc2 It needs to go further in rooting out unsavoury elements within its ranks and proving it is more than a one\u8211\'20\'13man band, albeit an entertaining one with some popular tunes.\par \par \uc2 IN CONTRAST the Tories under \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  cannot boast the same Eurosceptic pedigree as Ukip. The Prime Minister is still hampered by his failed attempt to stop his party "banging on about Europe" and his failure to deliver a referendum on the EU Lisbon Treaty that was shamefully signed by \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But Mr Cameron does deserve credit for responding in the right way to the anti\u8211\'20\'13EU pressure brought by Ukip, many of his own backbenchers and the Daily Express's crusade for a British exit.\par \par \uc2 He has made strenuous efforts to protect Britain's welfare system from exploitation from benefit\u8211\'20\'13seeking migrants from other EU countries.\par \par \uc2 And he has come up with constructive proposals for shielding Britain from "ever\u8211\'20\'13closer union" with the rest of the EU and in the long term for curbing the freedom\u8211\'20\'13ofmovement rules that have bred unrestricted \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Most important of all Mr Cameron has given his word that he will not return to Downing Street after the next general election without a guarantee of an in\u8211\'20\'13or\u8211\'20\'13out referendum. As things stand the Tories will have a strong case that only they can deliver an EU referendum in government.\par \par \uc2 But the country has not reached that election yet. Rather, tomorrow's poll is a moment when voters can make their voice heard in the EU.\par \par \uc2 A vote for either Ukip or the Tories will be a clear statement that Britain will no longer put up with the miserable status quo in Brussels and the drift towards a European super\u8211\'20\'13state.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately it is up to each Eurosceptic voter to make up their mind which party most suits their tastes and expresses their viewpoint.\par \par \uc2 For the Daily Express the most important thing is to make sure the voices of the millions who want to throw off the domination of Brussels are heard tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 When the polls open at 7am do not forget that you have a vote \u8211\'20\'13 and make sure it counts.\par \par \uc2 'Millions want to throw off the domination of Brussels'\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140521ea5l0001k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

The PM claimed he "understands" why so many people will vote Ukip tomorrow \u8212\'20\'14 and issued his biggest plea yet to defecting Tories to return to the fold.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron said: "There are a lot of decent people who do not have a racist bone in their body who are thinking of voting Ukip.\par \par \uc2 "They are frustrated by Europe. They want to see action on welfare.\par \par \uc2 I understand that. I am on your side and I can deliver those things."\par \par \uc2 And on the 2015 election, he added: "It is going to be very tough. My argument is that it's doable."\par \par \uc2 He admitted that he will not have "finished the job" on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  by then, but insisted he will succeed in his EU renegotiation because he will "get another treaty".\par \par \uc2 Our poll on how people will vote tomorrow shows Labour and Ukip tied on 27 per cent, with the Tories on 23 per cent. In a survey of those certain to vote, Nigel Farage's party leads by five points.\par \par \uc2 George Osborne will today blast Ukip and Labour as "forces of pessimism". tom.newton dunn@the-sun.co.uk CABBIE MEETS CAMMIE SEE PAGE 15\par \par \uc2 Lib Dem Other 6 Green 7% UKIP 30% LAB 25% CON 21% 11% Those certain to vote\par \par \uc2 UKIP 27% LAB 27% CON 23% Green Other Lib Dem 10% 8% 5 Euro elections poll Source: YouGov\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140521ea5l000c5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

Analysts at Exane \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2  bank say Scotland will not be able to pay for its pensions because of its ageing population. It recommends: "Encouraging inward \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  would be essential."\par \par \uc2 The Scottish National Party insists border checks will not be needed if Scots vote for independence in September's referendum, with First Minister Alex Salmond saying the "common travel area" would continue.\par \par \uc2 But MPs with constituencies near the border yesterday told The Sun that controls would be unavoidable if thousands of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  move to Scotland.\par \par \uc2 Former Scottish Secretary Michael Moore, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: "You either have similar \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policies, or you have border controls."\par \par \uc2 Berwick MP Sir Alan Beith said: "If the \uc2 UK government\uc2  believed Scotland was letting in people who could pose a danger, it might be necessary to exercise some controls. That would mean passport checks."\par \par \uc2 Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael meanwhile promised to give Scotland more powers if it votes to stay in the UK. kevin.\par \par \uc2 schofield@the-sun.co.uk\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140521ea5l00089\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

In the Heights won the Tony award for best musical when it appeared on Broadway in 2008. Now making its British debut, this Latin American remix of West Side Story and Rent boasts enough energy and verve to make you surrender gladly to an undeniably sappy story. This is a show with heart and hips alike.\par \par \uc2 We are in the north Manhattan neighbourhood of Washington Heights, among a largely Dominican \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  community struggling to get by as rents rise and gentrification looms. Quiara Alegr\u237\'00\'EDa Hudes's book gives us tentative romance, a forbidden romance, a lottery windfall, a yearning for home and a close sense of community. Nothing, in theory, we haven't seen before.\par \par \uc2 Yet Lin-Manuel Miranda's 20-odd witty, impassioned songs keep this narrative vivid and lively. And Luke Sheppard's energised production delivers the true ensemble feel that this tale demands. David Bedella brings gravitas as a proud, old-school, cab firm owner, Victoria Hamilton Barritt is delectably catty as the hairdresser, Daniela; Sam Mackay delivers slick raps and endearing self-doubt as the corner-store owner, Usnavi, but then pretty much everyone impresses in this mostly young and sinewy cast of 17.\par \par \uc2 Most of all, what a joy to sit so close to such slinky, joyous choreography by Drew McOnie. Yes, here and there it's constrained by the space \u8212\'20\'14 sometimes the sound mix is muddy too \u8212\'20\'14 but more often it is simply ravishing. Takis's set, with its graffiti and its scaffolded upstage area, where the seven-piece band play, evokes inner-city heat and confinement.\par \par \uc2 And after a busy but slightly overlong first half, the more reflective second half ends as a touching affirmation that home is where the heart is. To judge by the scale of this polished, propulsive production, In the Heights has an eye on life beyond the fringe. To judge by the spell it casts, it deserves one.\par \par \uc2 Box office: 020 7407 0234, to June 7\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140521ea5l000cy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Police have been told to gather intelligence on areas where \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  communities gather amid warnings of violence and hooliganism during the World Cup.\par \par \uc2 Forces across the country have been told for the first time to draw up contingency plans to deal with violence from foreign fans with a "similar drinking culture" to England supporters.\par \par \uc2 Officers have been told to identify pubs and clubs where foreign supporters congregate and ensure that they have sufficient officers on duty to respond to outbreaks of violence during or at the end of matches.\par \par \uc2 Fans travelling to Brazil this summer were also told to watch out for attacks by Argentina fans "given our shared history".\par \par \uc2 The warning from the \uc2 Association of Chief Police Officers\uc2  (Acpo) comes after violence from foreign fans, including Poland supporters in Lincolnshire, during the Euro 2012 championship. No England fans were arrested in Ukraine but hundreds of football supporters, including foreign fans, were arrested at home.\par \par \uc2 Deputy Chief Constable Andy Holt, Acpo's lead officer on football policing, said: "We have written to all forces saying be aware of communities in your area that are playing in the World Cup because they need policing. It is not just England fans; it is all the countries that have people based in the UK." Mr Holt identified London as "a real melting pot" and said there were other areas with large populations from countries involved in the World Cup.\par \par \uc2 The contingency plans are likely to include matches involving Russia, which could lead to clashes with supporters of eastern European teams, such as Poland and Ukraine, not involved in the competition. Other matches likely to be considered a possible risk involve Croatia, Bosnia, Spain, Portugal, Brazil and Argentina.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron overruled Home Office objections and allowed pubs to stay open late during England matches starting after 8pm. Senior police officers recommended that pubs should be required to get special licences.\par \par \uc2 The Brazilian authorities have also warned British police about the risk to England fans from hooligans from neighbouring Argentina. Warnings about the presence of violent Argentina fans will be sent to England supporters by text messages and over \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr Holt said he did not believe the Brazilian authorities knew how many Argentina fans would be arriving for the World Cup.\par \par \uc2 Supporters will also be advised about large-scale political demonstrations involving up to 200,000 protesters, which are considered the main risk to the estimated 5,000 to 10,000 England fans travelling to Brazil.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140521ea5l000ax\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 If politicians ignore the causes of the housing crisis, they will be punished\par \par \uc2 "One may as well begin with the housing market. Sick though you may well be of reading about property, there's a good bet that it will dominate the debate in the run-up to next year's election.\par \par \uc2 '' And rightly so. For in housing we have an issue that, one way or another, affects us all. It is one that successive governments of both stripes have repeatedly and consistently botched.\par \par \uc2 Little wonder that Mark Carney, the country's new economic surveyor, has concluded that Britain's property market has "deep, deep structural problems".\par \par \uc2 Those structural problems are hardly new. To understand how they came about one needs to look back a hundred years or so, to the beginning of Britain's love affair with housing.\par \par \uc2 Until the Edwardian era, the majority of middle-class Britons were quite content to rent rather than own, but then something changed. EM Forster depicted the moment in Howards End on the face of it, a novel about spiritual connection but, in reality, "primarily a hunt for a home", the author admitted.\par \par \uc2 The Schlegel sisters, leaseholders in London, fell in love with the idea of owning Howards End, a home on the edge of suburbia. Prices in the capital were rising fast as the city grew, but the absence of planning restrictions meant that smaller houses, including the Schlegels' home on Wickham Place, were being torn down and replaced with mansion blocks. London was stretching its tendrils into the countryside. Though Forster never specified where the house that gave the book its name was located, it's a good bet that within a few years of publication it would have become engulfed in the suburbs \u8212\'20\'14 a bit like Croydon.\par \par \uc2 As the 20th century wore on, government after government encouraged voters to buy their own homes. A promise to open up home ownership to all became a permanent feature of Conservative and Labour manifestos alike. Over time, they introduced policies to make it cheaper to buy: tax was waived on mortgage interest, capital gains tax was exempted from families' first properties, incentives were introduced to encourage council tenants to purchase their homes with Right to Buy. The proportion of households owning their property rose from 23 per cent in 1918 to 71 per cent by the turn of the millennium.\par \par \uc2 This rising tide of home ownership obscured policy mistakes beneath the surface. While plenty was done to increase demand for homes, government policy gradually served to reduce the supply. Draconian restrictions such as those brought in with the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 resulted in the erection of green belts around big towns. The preposterous upshot is that there is now considerably more land lying undeveloped throughout England, protected by the green belt 13 per cent than is built upon less than 9 per cent.\par \par \uc2 This policy blunder would have been unforgiveable enough were it not accompanied by many other discrete policies that have ratcheted up demand yet further: a rental regime that protects tenants less than in almost any other country; a permissive \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy; evercheaper mortgage finance thanks both to financial innovation and successively looser monetary policy. Help to Buy's mortgage guarantee scheme is only the latest in a long line of wheezes to stoke our appetite for property.\par \par \uc2 It doesn't take a genius to work out what happens when one cumulatively puffs up demand while limiting supply. Prices rise, pushing property out of reach for first-time buyers. Existing owners who benefit from those price rises buy second homes, with the result that Britain has one of the highest shares of multiple homeowners in the world.\par \par \uc2 Most dangerously, the financial system becomes ever more dependent on mortgage business. As it becomes more difficult to work out what property is really worth, recurrent bubbles become inevitable. All three of the big banking crises faced by this country over the past century were, in large part, due to problems in the mortgage industry.\par \par \uc2 To top it all off, the very apparatus of homebuying is deeply archaic. Astonishingly, given that buying a home is the most significant financial decision in anyone's life, estate agents remain unregulated. The process of bidding and agreeing a property purchase is capricious and unpredictable gazumping and gazundering are commonplace, particularly during periods of big price changes. Stamp duty is a perversely structured, medieval tax. Those opportunities there have been to modernise this system have been wasted (home information packs, anyone?).\par \par \uc2 One probably shouldn't be surprised. Homeowners rather like the notion that merely by occupying their property they are making money (\u163\'00\'A310,000 a month, according to the most recent Hometrack calculation).\par \par \uc2 Little matter that short of downsizing or moving abroad, there is no way of crystallising this gain or, more significantly, that it simply represents an economic transfer to homeowners from those off the ladder (often their children). Homeowners are significantly more likely to vote than their renting counterparts.\par \par \uc2 Or so went the narrative of the past hundred years. Then, a decade ago, something changed: home ownership levels quietly peaked, and then fell. They are now down to 65 per cent and, for the first time in a century, those in their 30s and younger are less likely than their parents to get on the housing ladder.\par \par \uc2 This was hardly sinking in at the 2010 election, when each political party's manifesto pledged to safeguard the green belt. However, those who are trapped off the housing ladder are getting older, and are more likely to vote. The longer politicians ignore the root causes of the housing crisis, the more likely they are to be punished."\par \par \uc2 Ed Conway is economics editor of Sky News.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Labour and Ukip are forging a new anti-business consensus that makes Britain less welcoming for global investors, \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  will say today. Both parties want to tell voters that Britain can "stop the world and get off", suggesting it is possible to recreate the Britain that existed before the rampant globalisation of the past 30 years.\par \par \uc2 The chancellor will be speaking at the CBI dinner where Sir Mike Rake, the president, will say that Britain is becoming a more risky place to do business because of the actions of all the political parties.\par \par \uc2 Mr Osborne will try to steer the criticism onto Ukip and Labour, casting both in the same, inward-facing, protectionist mould in a pre-election battle cry.\par \par \uc2 In the same speech he will also say "Our task to secure our country's economic future is not even half done", amid signs that the scale of cuts in the next parliament may be bigger than those in this one.\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives are increasingly keen to use Labour's opposition to the \uc2 Pfizer\uc2  takeover of \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2  as further proof they are anti-business, while they are linking this with business's dislike of Ukip's opposition to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr Osborne will say: "Political parties on the left and the populist right have this in common: they want to pull up the drawbridge and shut Britain off from the world. They want to constrain foreign investment in our economy, and deprive us of the British jobs that it has created in industries from car manufacturing to energy.\par \par \uc2 "They want to set prices, regulate incomes, impose rent controls, wage war on big business, demonise wealth creation, renationalise industries, and pretend that they can re-establish control overall aspects of the economy. "Whether from the left or the populist right, we now see a deeply pessimistic, depressing, anti-business agenda."\par \par \uc2 Their joint endeavor would harm the economy, he will say. "It takes advantage of the understandable anxieties of a population unsettled by the pace of globalisation, and peddles a myth that Britain can stop the world and get off.\par \par \uc2 "It portrays the changes to the international economy that have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, and opened vast new markets for Britain, as nothing more than a race to the bottom.\par \par \uc2 "But price and incomes controls, renationalisations, and erecting the government as the enemy of business and wealth creation will lead Britain down a path of relative economic decline."\par \par \uc2 The CBI president will echo the call for Britain to remain open for international business. Sir Mike will say: "Business is in no doubt that the UK must retain and secure its global future, trading and investing. Open markets are an essential part of our open economy.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot be our best when in isolation, we have to face outwards: keep connected to the world and embrace the opportunities afforded to us by being based in the EU.\par \par \uc2 "It's a fact that economies and businesses are globally interconnected: by goods, services, finance and people. And the growth and jobs we need depend on that connectedness, it makes us more resilient, more dynamic."\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140521ea5l0008f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw119\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1785\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 4million people in Scotland are entitled to vote It's up to you to keep this man out..\b0\par\par\uc2 3,009 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par \uc2 Scottish Daily Record\par \uc2 DRECRD\par \uc2 1; National\par 1,2,3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Scottish Daily Record & Sunday Mail Ltd   \par \par \uc2 The threat from Farage and UKIP is real.. let's show them we reject politics of fear\par \par \uc2 THE PARTIES HEADING IN A tale of tw N HERE wo nationalisms\par \par \uc2 RECORD VIEW LET'S face facts. The election Scotland really cares about this year happens in September, not tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 But if you're one of the many who think the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  vote doesn't matter - that it has nothing to do with you or your life - take a look at the man on the left, and then think again.\par \par \uc2 If, after the results are all in, you want to listen to Nigel Farage crowing about UKIP gaining their first ever foothold in Scottish politics, just stay at home like you were planning to.\par \par \uc2 If you share the Daily Record's belief that his fearmongering, Thatcherite, anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  politics have no place in an inclusive, tolerant country like Scotland, get out and vote and help to stop him.\par \par \uc2 Most Scots see UKIP as an irrelevance, a ragtag, chaotic bunch of eccentric Little Englanders obsessed with the old prejudices of their angry brigade of voters down south.\par \par \uc2 Their policies - like a flat rate of income tax to help the rich and imposing more privatisation on the \uc2 NHS\uc2  - are alien to the vast majority of Scots. Their obsession, withdrawal from the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , fails to resonate here like it does with some in England.\par \par \uc2 And when Farage claimed at the weekend that many Britons wouldn't want to live next door to Romanians, many Scots detected an ugly whiff of racism.\par \par \uc2 UKIP have never won a single seat in any election north of the border.\par \par \uc2 But make no mistake: this time, the threat is real. And as a result, it's easy to argue that no European election has TURN TO PAGE TWO FROM PAGE ONE ever been as impor tant for Scotland.\par \par \uc2 Four million of us can vote tomorrow. At the last European elections in 2009, the turnout was a paltry 28.6 per cent.\par \par \uc2 We need to do better. The more of us who vote, the less likely it is that UKIP will win a seat.\par \par \uc2 Scotland is one constituency in tomorrow's vote, but it returns six MEPs. And Farage's party have a chance of grabbing one of those seats because of the complex system of proportional representation used to send MEPs to the parliament in Strasbourg.\par \par \uc2 Last time, the SNP were the largest party and got two MEPs. Labour also got two and the Tories and Lib Dems one each.\par \par \uc2 But a Record poll this week suggested the Lib Dem vote has collapsed - down from 11.5 per cent in the 2009 Euro poll to six per cent - as voters punish them for imposing a Tory-led Westminster Government on Scotland. And that could leave the door r UKIP and Farage. Their ate, David Coburn, is g he will cause a "political uake" in Scotland. poll showed UKIP had ent support here - a small y, but a significant one. Tories' 13 per cent vote n our poll is likely to be to keep their one MEP, e SNP and Labour holding heir two each.\par \par \uc2 open for candida claiming earthqu Our p 10 per ce minority The T share in enough with the on to th And if support couple o f Farage can increase his t in Scotland by another of points, that could give UKIP the sixth Scottish seat.\par \par \uc2 Pundits see the battle for the seat as a tale of two nationalisms - a straight fight between UKIP and the SNP.\par \par \uc2 And with Farage riding high in the polls in England and getting blanket media coverage, UKIP's profile has never been higher.\par \par \uc2 The SNP are determined to keep Farage out - and not just so they can increase their own tally of MEPs. \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2 , as always, has his eye on September 18.\par \par \uc2 If UKIP win overall in England but achieve nothing in Scotland, the SNP will seize on the result as proof of the two countries' wildly different political views.\par \par \uc2 And there's some evidence Scots are ready to listen. One recent poll said almost a fifth of people in Scotland would be more likely to vote Yes if UKIP topped the European poll.\par \par \uc2 So a UKIP defeat in Scotland would suit the SNP, but we would argue that unionist voters have just as strong an interest in keeping Farage out. We believe UKIP's siren call to disaffected voters - that all our problems have their roots in \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - is a dangerous falsehood.\par \par \uc2 UKIP claim migrants take jobs from Britons. Studies have repeatedly shown no link between EU migration and unemployment.\par \par \uc2 UKIP claim migrants jump housing queues. In reality, very few get council homes, and a lack of affordable housing is the real problem.\par \par \uc2 UKIP claim migrants undercut Britons' wages, but official statistics show migration has no impact on wage levels. Public sector pay freezes and zero hours contracts are the real drivers of poverty among workers.\par \par \uc2 UKIP claim "health tourists" and \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  put strain on the \uc2 NHS\uc2  - a line the Tories repeat.\par \par \uc2 But in reality, up to 20,000 people come to Britain to use the \uc2 NHS\uc2  while 63,000 Britons travel abroad for treatment. And overseas staff play a huge part in keeping the \uc2 NHS\uc2  going.\par \par \uc2 Let's also remember that Scotland has a low birth rate and an ageing population. Many, including the \uc2 Scottish Government\uc2 , believe we need more \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , not less.\par \par \uc2 Nick Lowles of pressure group Hope Not Hate, said: "We solve nothing by whipping up fears about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "This only creates fear and division and the real issues get ignored.\par \par \uc2 "UKIP are a distraction from the real issues we face. Please reject the politics of fear."\par \par \uc2 SUPPORT? YOUR AFTER WHO'S SCOTLAND has six MEPs and six major parties are standing for election. We can expect to see the SNP top the ballot again but with Labour next, reviving compared with 2009 and likely to win two seats.\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives can expect to retain their one MEP, despite their low support, but there will be a real fight for the sixth seat.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems are facing meltdown and the Greens, at about six per cent, do not appear to have enough support either.\par \par \uc2 That means UKIP could come close to winning the sixth seat. It looks like a straight fight between them and the SNP.\par \par \uc2 Scottish Conservatives Topping the Tories' list of candidates in the proportional representation poll is Dr Ian Duncan, who aims to replace the Tories' outgoing MEP Struan Stephenson.\par \par \uc2 Duncan is a former chief executive of the \uc2 Scottish Fishermen's Federation\uc2 . He has also been head of the Scottish Parliament's office in Brussels and a clerk to the Parliament's European committee.\par \par \uc2 Stephenson's former assistant, Belinda Don, is second on the Tories' list but has little chance of being elected.\par \par \uc2 Scottish Green The Greens' number one candidate is Maggie Chapman, a university lecturer in geography and an Edinburgh city councillor. She is also co-convener of the Scottish Greens.\par \par \uc2 Scottish Labour Labour's top candidate for Scotland is David Martin, who has been an MEP since 1984.\par \par \uc2 He was formerly Labour's leader in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , and served as a vice-president of the parliament between 1984 and 2009.\par \par \uc2 Catherine Stihler MEP is second on Labour's Scotland list. She has been an MEP since 1999 and was previously president of the National Union of Students. She is currently Labour's European spokeswoman on consumer rights and serves on the economic and monetary affairs committee.\par \par \uc2 In third place for Labour is Derek Munn, a one-time adviser to former first minister Jack McConnell.\par \par \uc2 Scottish Liberal Democrats Top candidate is MEP George Lyon, who won his seat in 2009. He was previously a member of the Scottish Parliament, rising to be deputy finance minister and chief whip before losing his seat to the SNP in 2007.\par \par \uc2 Lyon has been a vice-chairman of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 's budget committee, but the Lib Dems are in freefall in the polls and his seat is in jeopardy again.\par \par \uc2 Scottish National Party Veteran MEP Ian Hudghton, first elected at a by-election in 2004, heads the SNP list of candidates. Three of them have a realistic chance of making it to Strasbourg.\par \par \uc2 Hudghton is vice-president of the European Free Alliance, a group of smaller pro-independence parties from different parts of Europe who band together in the parliament and are allies of the Greens.\par \par \uc2 Second place on the SNP list goes to Alyn Smith, also an MEP since 2004. He is a member of the agriculture and rural development committee.\par \par \uc2 The third placed candidate is Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, a lawyer who has received an OBE for services to business. She was previously a member of both the Tory and Labour parties.\par \par \uc2 United Kingdom Independence Party UKIP's top candidate is David Coburn, the London regional chairman of the party and a former Territorial Army soldier. He is a newcomer to Scottish politics and Scotland has never been good ground for UKIP, but his party's rising profile and the Lib Dems' collapse combine to give him a real chance.\par \par \uc2 Scots ready to play part WE found a fair amount of voter apathy when we took to the streets to ask Scots about their plans for tomorrow's poll.\par \par \uc2 But those who couldn't see the point of casting their votes were balanced out by men and women from all walks of life who always make a point of taking part in our democratic process. Let's hope there are plenty more like them.\par \par \uc2 Philip Simon TRAINEE solicitor Philip says he has been following the coverage leading up to the European elections.\par \par \uc2 And the 26-year-old, from Clydebank, near Glasgow, believes it's important to get out and vote.\par \par \uc2 Philip said: "I think I will probably vote Labour, although I'm not enthusiastic about it.\par \par \uc2 "I think I also voted in the last ones but I can't remember when they were.\par \par \uc2 "I do think it's important to have a say and to vote in the European elections.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of decisions are made by politicians in Europe and they affect a lot of people's lives in Scotland."\par \par \uc2 Kerry Magil ll s she didn't pay much attention verage until her voting card t. al from Springburn ll be at her local polling station KERRY, 24, admits to the election cov arrived in the post But the paraleg in Glasgow will stil tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 ill vote because so many ns are being made at Kerry said: "I wi important decisio European level.\par \par \uc2 say they won't vote, but then the round and complain about things happening.\par \par \uc2 "Some people s same people turn that are or will be "You have the r chance to try and right to vote so you can take the change things."\par \par \uc2 Gordon Don \uc2 GLASGOW council\uc2  worker Gordon says he had enough years ago of the "broken promises" of politicians - and didn't even know there was an election this week.\par \par \uc2 The 40-year-old said: "I gave up on politics a long time ago.\par \par \uc2 "You hear all these different sides talking about how they are going to do this or going to do that.\par \par \uc2 "But as soon as they get in, they do the exact opposite. It doesn't matter how we vote.\par \par \uc2 "I hear bits and bobs about what goes on in Europe and about how some laws affect us, such as taking things higher up to the European courts. But you can't really get the full picture.\par \par \uc2 "I will not be voting. Thursday will be my day off. I'll be enjoying myself instead. That's it."\par \par \uc2 Douglas Ewing DAD-OF-ONE Douglas, a motorcycle salesman, believes the results of the European elections could end up being meaningless if Scotland votes for independence in September.\par \par \uc2 The 35-year-old, from Howwood, Renfrewshire, still intends to use his vote tomorrow. But he said: "It makes no difference what happens when we have the referendum on the horizon.\par \par \uc2 "We have bigger fish to fry. "It all could mean nothing later in the year if there's a Yes vote and a veto from the EU on our membership."\par \par \uc2 Douglas added: "There have been a lot of negatives to come out of Europe, such as the Common Fisheries Policy.\par \par \uc2 "Scotland used to have the largest white fish fleet in Europe. But it has all been reduced in order to help landlocked countries."\par \par \uc2 Peter M McIntyre ws many Scots will ignore s vote - because of what's on n in September.\par \par \uc2 year-old outdoor activities said: "To be honest, I don't think o many people with the m coming up.\par \par \uc2 PETER kno tomorrow's the horizon The 35-y instructor s it matters t referendum "It will be But Pete in the Europ some last-m He said: "more focus September.\par \par \uc2 e overlooked by the majority." r, of Bathgate, will cast his vote pean elections - after doing minute research.\par \par \uc2 I know all about it but I'm a lot ed on what's going to happen in .fully researched the European o I'm not sure how I will vote. ably have a last-minute squint net and ask a few of my more developed friends."\par \par \uc2 "I've not elections so "I'll proba at the inter politically d Mary McTegue CASHIER Mary, 54, from Craigend in Glasgow, always votes in every election.\par \par \uc2 She said: "I am politically aware. "People died to get us the right to vote and I believe you either use it or lose it.\par \par \uc2 "But I do think there isn't a lot of information for people about what happens at the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , so a lot of people can't be bothered.\par \par \uc2 "I haven't decided who I'm going to vote for yet. I'm more of a floating voter.\par \par \uc2 "I used to be a staunch Labour supporter. Now I lean towards the SNP."\par \par \uc2 Michelle McFarlane THE 31-year-old fraud investigator said she definitely intends to use her vote on Thursday morning.\par \par \uc2 Michelle, of Glasgow's Auchinairn area, said: "I do believe in having a say in how things are run.\par \par \uc2 "I just believe that I should vote. We are all a part of Europe, aren't we?

A lot of people went through a lot of stuff to get us the vote."\par \par \uc2 But he added: "There is a disconnect between people and the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  - mainly because of the press, who give it a bad run.\par \par \uc2 "People in Austria also have a problem with the EU. Britain thinks it is the odd one out, but that's not the case.\par \par \uc2 "Personally, I waver on the issue but I'm more for it than against it."\par \par \uc2 Jack Miller GREAT-GRANDAD Jack, 80, is a staunch SNP supporter and votes in every general election and Holyrood poll.\par \par \uc2 But the retired gravedigger from Glasgow's Gorbals says he is not interested in what happens tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 used He joked: "I think that's the day I get paid."\par \par \uc2 Jack added: "I know the election is on but I'm not caring at all.\par \par \uc2 at "What is it anyway?

It is mostly portrayed as a failure that produced a currency system which wreaked havoc across the continent when it fell apart.\par \par \uc2 It is an unaccountable, faceless bureaucracy that imposes needless rules and opened the door to migrants from the poorest parts of the east to compete for jobs in the wealthier west.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Union\uc2  is guilty, in part, of many of these things. It needs reform, but not destruction, because overall it has been a force for good in our lives, too.\par \par \uc2 The working hours directive that stops companies exploiting workers comes from EU regulation. Stopping roaming charges for mobile phones and long overdue reforms to fishing and agricultural policy help to show the EU is inching towards relevance.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Union\uc2  and MEPs influence and affect much of our lives. The choice we make tomorrow is not a futile one. It sets the political weather in Scotland now but sets the direction of Europe for the next five years.\par \par \uc2 Across Europe there is a hostile, right-wing coalition intent on destroying the EU. In Britain that is headed by the xenophobic UKIP who use anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  rhetoric as barely disguised racism.\par \par \uc2 The EU was founded as an economic body to make sure the carnage of war would never again tear apart the continent.\par \par \uc2 Right now, on the edge of Europe, the fabric of democracy is being dismantled by an expansionist, nationalistic Russia.\par \par \uc2 We need a stable EU, defending workers' rights, ensuring trade and commerce prosper across open borders to counter the forces that would tear the continent apart again.\par \par \uc2 Scotland needs political representatives who reflect its outward looking traditions.\par \par \uc2 To ensure that we must go out and vote - but not for a party who have extremist views, who would rather turn their back on the world and on Europe and would set us against our neighbours.\par \par \uc2 Do not be tempted by the siren call of Nigel Farage or UKIP. A vote for them is a vote for intolerance and we do not see Scotland as that kind of country.\par \par \uc2 Document DRECRD0020140521ea5l0000p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 A big anti-EU vote could make things worse for Britain\b0\par\par\uc2 By Mats Persson   \par \uc2 928 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par 07:30\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The centre-Right and socialist MEPs may gang up to freeze out those they see as extreme to vote for 'even more Europe\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Ahead of tomorrow\u8217\'20\'19s European elections, all eyes are on Ukip. But David Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s biggest EU challenge begins when voting ends. Politics in Europe have rarely looked messier. The think tank {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.openeurope.org.uk/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  Open Europe}}}\uc2 , of which I am director, has estimated that anti-establishment or anti-EU parties could get 31 per cent of the seats in the next \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  (EP) \u8211\'20\'13 a substantial increase. Across Europe, parties with policies ranging from anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to downright bizarre will breathe down the necks of mainstream politicians.\par \par \uc2 In Greece, SYRIZA (anti-austerity politics on steroids) is likely to win. The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, which has advocated planting mines on Greece\u8217\'20\'19s border to keep \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  out, could get 8 to 10 per cent of the votes. In France, Denmark and Netherlands, anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  parties could also win. Even Germany could see a fascist MEP elected.\par \par \uc2 These groups cannot be explained by reference to a conventional political spectrum \u8211\'20\'13 many are actually socialists in nationalist clothing \u8211\'20\'13 and their rise also depends on factors beyond \u8220\'20\'1CEurope\u8221\'20\'1D. Still, added to the fact that many people won\u8217\'20\'19t bother to vote, these elections are likely to be another damning indictment of the EU status quo.\par \par \uc2 Paradoxically, the net effect might be to make the next EP even more integrationist. First, the anti-establishment parties will by no means form a cohesive bloc. Second, with a larger anti-EU contingent, the two major groups \u8211\'20\'13 the socialists and the centre-Right European People\u8217\'20\'19s Party (EPP) \u8211\'20\'13 will have a strong incentive to gang up to freeze out those they see as extreme.\par \par \uc2 Strangely, these two groups already vote the same way two thirds of the time in the EP, with a heavy bias towards \u8220\'20\'1Cmore Europe\u8221\'20\'1D. The great risk is that a motley crew of anti-EU nationalists and trigger-happy federalists crowd out the reformers in the middle \u8211\'20\'13 including free traders \u8211\'20\'13 offering voters an artificially polarised choice between \u8220\'20\'1Cmore Europe\u8221\'20\'1D or \u8220\'20\'1Cno Europe\u8221\'20\'1D. This would be a sad irony, as polls show that voters across Europe prefer sweeping reform when it is on offer.\par \par \uc2 Why should British people care? Because the EP, for better or worse, is now a powerful institution: it regulates how many hours you work, your online activities, who the UK trades with and how the EU spends your money. Under \u8220\'20\'1Cco-decision\u8221\'20\'1D, MEPs could (if they wanted to) veto roughly half the reforms Cameron wants to achieve before that 2017 in/out referendum. This includes tightening benefit rules for EU migrants, making it easier for UK businesses to access the EU market and signing trade deals with the US and emerging markets. In fact, an anti-reform EP could surpass Paris as Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s biggest obstacle to successful renegotiation.\par \par \uc2 There is a massive second challenge for No 10: the next president of the executive arm, the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 , who will be selected shortly after the elections. In the EU sausage machine, the commission is largely in charge of what goes in. Bizarrely, because of the Lisbon Treaty, no\u160\'00\'A0one knows who ultimately decides who\u160\'00\'A0becomes the president, although the\u160\'00\'A0EP claims that it, somehow, has the\u160\'00\'A0democratic right to determine the\u160\'00\'A0appointment.\par \par \uc2 The three main candidates the EP has proposed make \uc2 Jos\u233\'00\'E9 Manuel Barroso\uc2 , the current president, look like a raving Eurosceptic: for the socialists, Martin Schulz, who thinks it\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cpossible and necessary\u8221\'20\'1D to have a United States of Europe; the liberals\u8217\'20\'19 Guy Verhofstadt, who has likened Cameron to a \u8220\'20\'1Cmad man threatening to blow himself up\u8221\'20\'1D; and, for the EPP, the uninspiring Jean-Claude Juncker, for 18 years the prime minister of Luxembourg, infamous for saying important EU decisions should be taken \u8220\'20\'1Cin dark secret rooms\u8221\'20\'1D. \u8220\'20\'1CWhen it becomes serious, you have to lie,\u8221\'20\'1D as he put it.\par \par \uc2 So the fresh faces of European democracy are all 55-plus men owing their careers to the dated notion of \u8220\'20\'1Cever closer union\u8221\'20\'1D that led to the big gap between voters and Brussels in the first place. Even in Germany, only 17 per cent of voters can identify their compatriot Martin Schulz as a lead candidate, according to a recent poll. In the UK, none of the parties, save the Greens, back any of the candidates, with Labour stopping just short of declaring Schulz a persona non grata in the UK. If one of these men bagged the job, it would massively complicate the EU reform agenda and serve as a running recruitment campaign for Ukip. Many will wonder whether the UK can be part of a club that puts someone like that in charge.\par \par \uc2 So what should Britain\u8217\'20\'19s Government do? Well, it can\u8217\'20\'19t veto the presidential appointment so should dig in to get enough allies on board to vote for a more sensible candidate. There\u8217\'20\'19s a chance Angela Merkel (her socialist coalition partners notwithstanding) may parachute in a compromise candidate at the last minute.\par \par \uc2 Crucially, Britain must not give up on the EP \u8211\'20\'13 there are still many hard-working MEPs and the election results will force many to pause to think. The key is to redouble efforts to get national capitals to sign up to sweeping reforms, including strengthening the link between EU decisions and national parliaments.\par \par \uc2 More of the EP\u8217\'20\'19s top-down brand of trans-national democracy would be a gift to anti-EU parties across the continent.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140521ea5l000jh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s own cost-of-living crisis\b0\par\par\uc2 By Telegraph View   \par \uc2 493 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par 07:20\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage may not be able to organise a carnival but he does connect with working-class voters in a way that other politicians like the Labour leader do not\par \par \uc2 David Cameron must have been beside himself with glee. On the penultimate day of campaigning for the local and European elections, his two main rivals \u8211\'20\'13 Nigel Farage and Ed Miliband \u8211\'20\'13 bounced from blunder to blunder. Mr Miliband kicked things off by estimating the price of his weekly shop at something like \u163\'00\'A370 or \u163\'00\'A380, roughly \u163\'00\'A330 below the UK average.\par \par \uc2 Later, in an interview with Radio Wiltshire, he insisted that Jim Grant was doing an excellent job as leader of \uc2 Swindon council\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 despite obviously knowing neither Mr Grant\u8217\'20\'19s name, nor that it was the Tories who actually controlled the council.\par \par \uc2 As for Mr Farage, a street carnival intended to demonstrate Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s embrace of minorities descended into farce after the steel band pulled out and the event was picketed by those upset about his attitude to Romanians. The Ukip leader himself was a no-show: his local organiser helpfully explained that he could not be expected to appear at a venue \u8211\'20\'13 Croydon high street \u8211\'20\'13 that was \u8220\'20\'1Cunsafe\u8221\'20\'1D and a \u8220\'20\'1Cdump\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Beyond adding to the gaiety of the nation, does any of this actually matter? Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s recent surge will not be undone by one shambolic event; otherwise, the rolling fiasco that was Godfrey Bloom\u8217\'20\'19s performance at its party conference would have torpedoed it months ago. And while Mr Miliband may have put a few noses out of joint in Swindon, his was the sort of lapse that the campaign treadmill is almost designed to provoke.\par \par \uc2 Yet such vignettes do have an impact when they confirm a preconception. When Margaret Thatcher showed off her skills as a housewife, it helped to foster the idea that she would apply the same scrimp-and-save approach to the public purse. And when Mr Miliband reveals his ignorance of such matters, it suggests that a man who has made the \u8220\'20\'1Ccost of living crisis\u8221\'20\'1D his mantra has no actual experience of those costs. This helps to explain his stubborn failure to connect with voters: neither his personality, nor his brand of \u8220\'20\'1Clofty seminar-room socialism\u8221\'20\'1D (to quote the New Statesman), resonates with the man on the Croydon omnibus.\par \par \uc2 Under such circumstances, yesterday\u8217\'20\'19s warning from Mr Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s occasional guru, Lord Glasman, feels especially pertinent. Mr Farage may not be able to organise a carnival, or to win over disgruntled \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . But he does connect with working-class voters in a way that other politicians do not. Lord Glasman describes this as \u8220\'20\'1Ca huge problem for Labour\u8221\'20\'1D, with Mr Farage appealing to a \u8220\'20\'1Csense of dispossession\u8221\'20\'1D in its heartlands. Whatever the outcome of tomorrow\u8217\'20\'19s elections, the disillusionment that Ukip feeds on will endure \u8211\'20\'13 as will the challenge it poses to the political establishment.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140521ea5l000gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage is not racist and it is wrong to 'abuse' him for reflecting 'generalised disquiet' about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , Ed Miliband ally says\par \par \uc2 Labour has a "huge problem" with Ukip and should recognise Nigel Farage is raising "widespread concerns" instead of calling him a racist, one of Ed Miliband's most senior allies has said.\par \par \uc2 Lord Glasman, a policy guy who was ennobled by Mr Miliband, said that Mr Farage was not racist when he suggested that he would feel "uncomfortable" if Romanians moved in next door.\par \par \uc2 He said that it is wrong to "abuse" Mr Farage for "saying what he thinks", adding that people are "genuinely entitled to feel concerned about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ".\par \par \uc2 He told The Telegraph that Ukip appeals to a "sense of dispossession" in the Labour heartlands and urged Mr Miliband to select more candidates from working-class backgrounds who haven't been to university.\par \par \uc2 He also said that that Labour leader comes across as too "ideological" and "seminary" when he appears on television and needs to learn to speak in a more "straightforward" and direct manner.\par \par \uc2 His intervention comes after Mr Farage was widely criticised for saying he would be "uncomfortable" if Romanians moved in next door.\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, accused him of making a "racial slur" while Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the comments were racist.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  has said that Mr Farage's comments were "pretty unpleasant" but added that it is for voters to decide whether the UK Independence Party is racist.\par \par \uc2 Lord Glasman, however, said that Mr Farage was reflecting a "generalised disquiet" about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . He said: "I think people are very anxious about the scale of change. It doesn't do anybody any favours to stigmatise expressions of anxiety.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think he has said anything wrong, and I don't think the first response in political conversation [should be] to abuse people for saying what they think.\par \par \uc2 "People genuinely are entitled to feel concerned about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and we shouldn't begin the conversation by calling people names."\par \par \uc2 He said that Ukip is benefiting from the "steady erosion of the working class vote" over the last decade. A YouGov poll published last weekend found that 14 per cent of Labour voters will vote for Ukip at the European elections on Thursday\par \par \uc2 Lord Glasman said: "Ukip is a huge problem for Labour. They are talking to a sense of dispossession in our heartlands, appealing to working class voters who are historically very committed to Labour. It's a strange coalition between the disaffected Tory right and the northern disaffected working class left.\par \par \uc2 "We should be developing more working class leaders from the constituencies we represent, so they can be part of the communities they represent. It shouldn't just be university educated people."\par \par \uc2 He said that Mr Miliband has "real quality" and "cares about people, but needs to work more on his approach to television broadcasts.\par \par \uc2 He said: "He should talk completely straightforwardly on the television, just as he does when he's off it. Don't get too ideological, get straight to the point. You've got someone who could be really taken to [by the public] and suddenly when he goes on television he goes quite seminary.\par \par \uc2 "He needs to speak more from his own experience, his own life, his own family and the hopes he has for Britain."\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140521ea5l000e1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 LABOUR has a "huge problem" with the UK Independence Party and should recognise that Nigel Farage is raising "widespread concerns" instead of calling him a racist, one of Ed Miliband's most senior allies has said.\par \par \uc2 Lord Glasman, the Labour "guru" who was rewarded with a peerage by Mr Miliband, said Mr Farage was not racist in suggesting that he would feel "uncomfortable" if Romanians moved in next door. He added that it was wrong to "abuse" Mr Farage for "saying what he thinks", and that people are "genuinely entitled to feel concerned about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ".\par \par \uc2 Lord Glasman told The Daily Telegraph that Ukip appeals to a "sense of dispossession" in the Labour heartlands. He urged Mr Miliband, the Labour leader, to select more candidates from working\u8211\'20\'13class backgrounds who haven't been to university. He also said that Mr Miliband comes across as too "ideological" and "seminary" when he appears on television and suggested that he should learn to speak in a more "straightforward" manner.\par \par \uc2 Lord Glasman's intervention came after Mr Farage was widely criticised for saying he would be "uncomfortable" if Romanians moved in next door. Mr Miliband described this as a "racial slur". \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , the Prime Minister, said Mr Farage's comments were "pretty unpleasant" but it was for voters to decide whether Ukip is a racist party.\par \par \uc2 Lord Glasman, however, said that Mr Farage was reflecting a "generalised disquiet" about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He added: "I think people are very anxious about the scale of change. It doesn't do anybody any favours to stigmatise expressions of anxiety. I don't think he has said anything wrong."\par \par \uc2 Editorial Comment: Page 25\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140521ea5l000co\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 MASS \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has brought little or no overall financial benefit to Britain and other countries, a study of the world's leading economies has concluded.\par \par \uc2 Data from around the world over the past 50 years has shown that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are not a "panacea" to economic growth, but nor are they a "major burden" on the taxpayer, the analysis by the Organisation for Economic Co\u8211\'20\'13operation and Development (\uc2 OECD\uc2 ) found.\par \par \uc2 Overall, the fiscal impact of migration in \uc2 OECD\uc2  countries has been "broadly neutral", with taxes paid by new arrivals usually matching what they receive in benefits. Although in some countries the amount that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  contribute to the public purse exceeds what they receive, new arrivals contribute less overall than the existing population, because many are less well paid.\par \par \uc2 The study is likely to be used by both sides in the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate.\par \par \uc2 Sir Andrew Green\uc2 , chairman of the campaign group \uc2 MigrationWatch UK\uc2 , said: "Gradually the claims for the benefits from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  have been fading and this is another nail in the coffin."\par \par \uc2 A report by \uc2 University College London\uc2  last year concluded that European migrants contributed \u163\'00\'A38.8 billion more to the British taxpayer than they received over a 16\u8211\'20\'13year period.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 OECD\uc2  study said that whatever state benefits migrants had received was largely covered by the taxes they had paid. "But while the impact of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  on the public purse is, broadly speaking, neutral, it is less favourable than that of native\u8211\'20\'13born people. In short, migrants are not a major burden on state spending, but nor are they a panacea for improving public finances."\par \par \uc2 International migrants account for around 12 per cent of the UK population, or 7.8 million people, the \uc2 OECD\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140521ea5l0008e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw160\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2400\pichgoal600

But it happened last night on BBC''s compelling Spotlight debate which pitted the six leading European candidates against one another.\par \par \uc2 Diane Dodds of the DUP and Jim Allister of the TUV, both Free Presbyterians as it happens, rallied around a statement by Bishop Noel Treanor of Down and Connor.\par \par \uc2 In it, he reiterated his church''s opposition to abortion and gay marriage and urged Catholics to do their homework to determine the attitudes of candidates on these divisive issues 1 JIM NICHOLSON: ULSTER UNIONISTS Jim Nicholson's one mistake was reading his opening and closing speeches.\par \par \uc2 He sounded like an exasperated Liberal, saying that "too many men give their view on abortion".\par \par \uc2 The long-serving Ulster Unionist \u8212\'20\'14 a quarter century under his belt in Brussels \u8212\'20\'14 also hit a homely note when he said the thing he missed most in Europe was "a good bowl of Irish stew".\par \par \uc2 VERDICT: A far more polished contribution than on UTV before deciding who to vote for.\par \par \uc2 The DUP and TUV are both more in line with Catholic teaching on this issue than the SDLP or Sinn Fein, and they see it as one of the issues on which they can start getting Catholic votes.\par \par \uc2 So Ms Dodds and Mr Allister were all for the Bishop's right to intervene \u8212\'20\'14 which Martina Anderson of Sinn Fein and the SDLP''s Alex Attwood, both of whom back gay marriage, were sniffy about at best.\par \par \uc2 Anna Lo of Alliance, a Taoist, was the only one to take on the 2 MARTINA ANDERSON: SINN FEIN This was a big improvement for Martina Anderson after Monday night's UTV debate.\par \par \uc2 The Sinn Fein candidate was fluent and gave the impression of speaking on her feet rather than doggedly reciting the party line.\par \par \uc2 She also struck a human note, speaking of missing her mother \u8212\'20\'14 who suffers from Alzheimer''s \u8212\'20\'14 when she representing her constituents in Europe.\par \par \uc2 VERDICT: Her best showing so far \u8212\'20\'14 she stood out Bishop in a full frontal attack, calling his words "church dictation".\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the highlight of the discussion came when Mr Allister turned on Ms Anderson to tell her "you are the only convicted bomber around this table" and she took it on the chin, refusing to rise to the bait.\par \par \uc2 The TUV leader showed ingenuity in inserting her past into the discussion at all. The question the six main Euro candidates were dealing with was whether the free movement of people in Europe was a good thing.\par \par \uc2 3 ALEX ATTWOOD: SDLP Alex Attwood can be dry on occasion \u8212\'20\'14 but he struck an inspirational tone on Europe and on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  when he said: "When we deny the \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  and the stranger, we deny ourselves".\par \par \uc2 Stormont's former environment minister nicely sidestepped Bishop Treanor''s advice on abortion and samesex marriage by saying both he and Richard Haass admired Pope Francis.\par \par \uc2 VERDICT: Effective rather than brilliant in discussion Mr Allister pointed out that Ms Anderson had once jumped bail and gone on the run to Glasgow where she was arrested with a bomb team.\par \par \uc2 She let him make his point and move on. Other candidates from the UUP, Alliance and the SDLP didn''t join it.\par \par \uc2 In the past, such an exchange might have descended into outrage and 'whataboutery', sparking a slanging match that would have taken up the whole broadcast.\par \par \uc2 Mr Allister and Ms Anderson were possibly the dominant voices in a debate where all 4 JIM ALLISTER: TUV Jim Allister didn''t confine himself to Europe \u8212\'20\'14 that was just for starters.\par \par \uc2 The Traditional Unionist Voice leader happily lambasted Stormont, power-sharing, the Maze, Brussels and samesex marriage.\par \par \uc2 At times the former DUP MEP \u8212\'20\'14 a party he now opposes \u8212\'20\'14 sailed a little close to the wind on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , sounding alarmist and attracting jeers from the audience. VERDICT: He has found a contrarian niche and is a star performer candidates performed well and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was one of the crunch subjects.\par \par \uc2 He presented himself as the protest vote. A vote for him was a vote against Brussels and against "floodgate \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ".\par \par \uc2 He sounded like someone on the further fringes of Ukip and didn''t seem to play well with either the other candidates or the audience.\par \par \uc2 One woman said that, after listening to his presentation, "maybe I should vote for you because I would really like to see you shipped off to Europe."\par \par \uc2 5 DIANE DODDS: DUP Diane Dodds was very much in command of her brief and spoke with authority, to the point of appearing quite severe.\par \par \uc2 The DUP candidate reached out to a more liberal constituency with her strong condemnations of racism.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Dodds, the most active of Northern Ireland's three MEPs, also stressed her work in helping community groups to get funding.\par \par \uc2 VERDICT: She has done the work and will keep the seat This time it was the unionist hardliner who shrugged it off and even joined in the laughter at his own expense.\par \par \uc2 Anna Lo of Alliance pointed out that there is, in fact, very little \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  here.\par \par \uc2 Roughly as many people come as leave and two-thirds of the 60,000 Poles who came here during the construction boom left again when it ended.\par \par \uc2 Diane Dodds warned against the dangers of racism, saying that her party had translated its election literature into seven languages.\par \par \uc2 It was a night of surprises.\par \par \uc2 6 ANNA LO: ALLIANCE PARTY Anna Lo stumbled occasionally, for instance on human trafficking, but found her pace later on.\par \par \uc2 The South Belfast MLA \u8212\'20\'14 the UK's first Chinese parliamentarian \u8212\'20\'14 spoke powerfully on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and had some soundbites which got applause, for example calling on Assembly members to "leave the Bible at the door" when they entered Stormont.\par \par \uc2 VERDICT: An uneven performance, good in parts\par \par \uc2 How they performed: our rating of the six candidates in debate\par \par \uc2 Document WBEL000020140521ea5l0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 @ i Your View\b0\par\par\uc2 1,021 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par \uc2 i\par \uc2 IIND\par \uc2 1ST\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd.

And here is why: Nick Clegg is the only party leader to have publicly and openly grasped the Ukip nettle.\par \par \uc2 Voters often ask why politicians never apologise when they have done or said something that turns out to be wrong. Nick Clegg has apologised. A brave thing to do.\par \par \uc2 The Liberals have taken the edge off Tory policies and helped turn around our economy.\par \par \uc2 Best of all, Nick Clegg has publicly stated that he wants church and state separated. Again, a brave thing to say and one which I support wholeheartedly. PAUL WHITE LISKEARD, CORNWALL\par \par \uc2 Farage, creature of the media\par \par \uc2 Farage mania has been created by the media. On television and in newspapers he has had more publicity than any other person. If someone is presented often enough, people remember.\par \par \uc2 As to him being in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , this is nothing but fraud when he does not believe in it. Please give more attention to the real political parties, not this upstart.\par \par \uc2 MARGARET SCOTT SCARBOROUGH\par \par \uc2 Frank Lane says that the UK housing shortage is caused by too many people (letter, 20 May). This may well be so and this problem is increased by the further admission of some 200,000 \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ukip is not about racism; it is about UK limited housing space etc. As for the EU, it is far too expensive.\par \par \uc2 JACK DUCKWORTH HARROGATE\par \par \uc2 I have always thought it would be interesting to learn Romanian. Now I am actually doing it. Thank you, Ukip!\par \par \uc2 P J STEWART BOARS HILL, OXFORD\par \par \uc2 Could I advertise for a non-Ukip voting neighbour?\par \par \uc2 MIKE BOR LONDON W2\par \par \uc2 Deflate that housing bubble\par \par \uc2 Oliver Duff is right to say that the Government needs to take action to stop the latest undesirable rise in house prices (Letter from the Editor, 20 May). However, rather than doing so by making it harder for first-time buyers to obtain a mortgage, the Government should instead restrict the buy-to-let sector.\par \par \uc2 UK investors and foreign wealth funds are outbidding potential first-time buyers and forcing up prices. Those who are priced out may then end up as reluctant tenants of the very people who outbid them.\par \par \uc2 We need to stop non-UK residents (or at least non-EU residents) from buying UK property, and make buy-to-let less attractive by no longer allowing landlords to count mortgage interest as an expense to reduce the tax due on their rental income.\par \par \uc2 RICHARD MOUNTFORD HILDENBOROUGH, KENT\par \par \uc2 Oliver Duff asks "Honestly, which of us wants a new housing development nearby?" One way of overcoming this nimbyism could be to get assurances that the quality of housing to be developed was good. I have an area of green in front of my house on which a new street could be fitted. Should the housing be of character and promote community participation, I'd welcome new building.\par \par \uc2 However, getting those assurances and making sure that developers deliver is the difficulty.\par \par \uc2 S TAYLOR LANCASHIRE Oliver Duff refers to the effect rising interest rates will have on the housing market and homeowners' ability to pay off their mortgages. I suggest the answer lies in taking on board Thomas Piketty's thesis that where the growth of capital outstrips economic growth, the gap between the haves and have-nots grows wider and wider.\par \par \uc2 The effect is that people who have capital can buy second and third homes and get a nice income from renting them out. Landlords are proliferating whilst at the other end of the ladder more people are struggling to get decent housing JULIA WINTER LETCHWORTH GARDEN CITY, HERTFORDSHIRE\par \par \uc2 The Attlee policy\par \par \uc2 After the Second World War, did the people of Britain worry about Clement Attlee's lack of charisma, or did they simply want a fairer society, better homes, improved educational opportunities for their children, and a free health service for all? The political system has not changed, yet now, it appears, the leader's personality is as important as his policies and for some, more so. The news that Ed Miliband "makes four out of ten people less likely to vote Labour" is disappointing.\par \par \uc2 Voters now seem to care more about politicians' geekiness than their proposals, more about their hairstyles than their principles. Is it any wonder we end up with a government which passes legislation to benefit the rich and to curtail social mobility, and privatises institutions owned by the people at the drop of a hat?\par \par \uc2 BERNIE EVANS LIVERPOOL\par \par \uc2 Nurses on the move If there is a nursing exodus to the US - which I doubt - this would be calamitous for health care in sub-Saharan Africa, the Philippines and Eastern Europe. The \uc2 NHS\uc2  usually poaches nurses from these countries, when there is a perceived shortage.\par \par \uc2 FRANK WILLIAMS POWYS\par \par \uc2 The average nurse would love to earn over \u163\'00\'A330,000, as Charlie Cooper reports (20 May). I'm not quite sure to what average he is referring, but the majority of staff nurses are on a Band 5 pay scale and earn between \u163\'00\'A321,478 and \u163\'00\'A327,901.\par \par \uc2 I am a senior staff nurse (Band 6) and despite 26 years experience, have not yet reached the heady heights of \u163\'00\'A330,000.\par \par \uc2 SARAH HUGHES CHICHESTER, WEST SUSSEX\par \par \uc2 Uncomfortable position\par \par \uc2 It seems to be a trend for women to be snapped with legs crossed, looking as though they are busting to go to the loo (Laverne Cox on Monday, Gemma Arterton on Tuesday). Are the photographers keeping them hanging about too long?\par \par \uc2 MARY FLEET LEEDS\par \par \uc2 Make an early start Memphis Barker (20 May) is correct in saying Thomas Jefferson initiated the Lewis-Clark expedition but not in 1781. There was no president until 1789, and Jefferson wasn't president until 1801.

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Comment\par \par \uc2 In a joint Radio Times interview with Marion Bartoli - whose Wimbledon victory last year he sourced, at the time, to the work ethic she derived from not being a long-legged "looker" in the Maria Sharapova mould - John Inverdale reveals what caused him to make the comment: pollen.\par \par \uc2 "I was feeling so ill that day," Inverdale ventures. "I had terrible hayfever, and all I could think of was that I wanted to go home to bed." This will be a relief to anyone misled into imagining that the remark was somehow related to his status as a laureate of rugger-bugger sexism.\par \par \uc2 If Ms Bartoli has forgiven him, so must we all. What cannot be excused is the stab at heroic victimhood. As a top-ranked hypochondriac with a sideline in malingering, I loathe a trouper. If you feel lousy (or exhausted, as Nigel Farage alleges he was when drawing his elegant distinction between Romanian and German \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 ), go to bed and trust the world to muck along without you.\par \par \uc2 While accepting Inverdale's indispensability to those who like their Wimbledon coverage drenched in smugness, sprinkled with narcissism and garnished with clich\u233\'00\'E9, other BBC presenters could have stepped in at short notice. Some might even have had access to antihistamines, and a better than 50-50 chance of marking the hugely intelligent, enchanting and, for what it's worth, beautiful Bartoli's triumph without Clarksonian reference to her appearance.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140521ea5l0001z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News | Elections 2014 Nearly 400 million people will have the right to vote in the EU polls - but many will see it as an opportunity for elite bashing, says JOHN LICHFIELD\par \par \uc2 Roll up, roll up for the most bizarre election on the planet.\par \par \uc2 More than 380,000,000 people have the right to vote in the next few days in what is, theoretically, an important milestone on the road to a Europe-wide democracy. Less than half of them, however, will bother to do so.\par \par \uc2 All the same - barring India - this will be the most gargantuan exercise in democracy ever attempted. Voting for 751 Euro MPs will take place in 28 countries over four days. And yet, it is those Europeans who detest the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , who appear most to cherish their right to vote this week.\par \par \uc2 Forget, for a moment, the predicted high Ukip vote in Britain. Eurosceptic, hard-nationalist parties are also threatening to top the poll, thanks to low turnouts, in at least two EU founding member states: France and the Netherlands. There will also be historically high Eurosceptic votes in Germany, Spain and Italy. One vote in three seems likely to go to parties of the hard right or the hard left, that loathe the EU in its present form - or in any form.\par \par \uc2 And yet, we are told, this is the first European election that will directly influence the high politics of Brussels. The outcome will, in theory, decide who replaces \uc2 Jose Manuel Barroso\uc2  as President of the European Commission at the end of this year.\par \par \uc2 After all the talk of a "democratic deficit" in Europe, of Brussels being "remote" and "faceless", Europe's voters have a chance to choose the personalities and policies that will shape the EU over the next five years. The great majority of them are scarcely aware that they have such a choice.\par \par \uc2 Martin Schulz or Jean-Claude Juncker? Guy Verhofstadt, Ska Keller or Alexis Tsipras? More than two-thirds of Europeans, according to one poll, do not know who these people are.\par \par \uc2 This will, in truth, be not one election but 29 - an election to the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  that grips few voters; and 28 national, mid-term opinion polls, whose results will be skewed by the low turnout. National issues, in almost every case, will shape the outcome as much, or more than, European issues.\par \par \uc2 The European elections, precisely because they are non-national elections, are a wonderful, double opportunity for elite-bashing. They offer a chance to boot mainstream parties, without risking putting the populists in power. They offer a chance to boot the EU for its own sake.\par \par \uc2 There is a jumble of voting days and polling methods, Britain, the Netherlands and Croatia will vote tomorrow. Malta, Ireland and the Czech Republic on Friday and Saturday; Cyprus, Latvia and Slovakia on Friday; Italy on Saturday; and the rest on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 There are four different kinds of proportional representation, according to national taste. There are immense multi-seat regional constituencies in Britain, Poland, France, Italy and Belgium. In the other countries there is a nationwide poll with party lists of candidates.\par \par \uc2 When all the results are known on Sunday night, there will be no coherent EU-wide pattern. There will be a strong anti-European vote in countries that are doing well economically, such as Britain, Austria and Finland. There will be an overwhelming vote for pro-European parties in some of the countries that have suffered most in the Euro crisis (Ireland and Portugal) but a strong anti-Brussels backlash in others (Greece, Italy and Spain).\par \par \uc2 In some countries (Britain, Germany, Finland, Denmark), the EU will be attacked as a bureaucratic intrusion into free enterprise and global trade. In others (France and Italy), it will be lampooned, by both hard right and hard left, as a conspiracy by ultra-liberal, Anglo-Saxon, market fundamentalists to enslave the ordinary people and destroy national identity. Only one anti-EU theme is constant from Britain to Hungary, Germany to Greece - that Brussels is responsible for unwelcome levels of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , both within the EU and from the outside.\par \par \uc2 The elections will not paint a flattering picture of the EU. Sixty six years after the creation of the Common Market, 100 years after the start of a Great European Civil War, it will emerge as, at worst, detested and, at best, misunderstood and unloved.\par \par \uc2 Many will interpret the results as proof that the Union is doomed. They could just as easily be offered as proof that the EU is indispensable (but needs radical overhaul). Consider what might happen to the European free market alone if there was no EU treaties to restrain all those jarring national differences.\par \par \uc2 In France, Marine Le Pen's anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , anti-market, anti-American party, Front National (FN), hopes to emerge this weekend as the leader of Anti-Europe. The FN may win as many as 20 of the 74 French seats - even though it only has two seats in the French national parliament.\par \par \uc2 Ms Le Pen is in a partnership, called "the European Alliance for Freedom" (EAF), with the Geert Wilders' anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  party, the PVV, in the Netherlands; with the "True Finns"; and with the hard right Austrian freedom party, the FPO. With other odds and ends, she should comfortably win the 25 seats from seven countries that she needs to form a parliamentary group in Strasbourg.\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage and Ukip have refused to throw in their lot with Ms Le Pen. To her fury, he insists that the French FN remains racist and anti-semitic in its "DNA". Ms Le Pen retorts that he is jealous of her attempts to create a hard European right under her leadership. All the same, Ukip should be able to greatly expand its existing "Europe of Freedom and Democracy" group, mostly with right-wing nationalist, eastern European parties. Some of the wilder, neo-Nazi fringes of the European hard right - Jobbik from Hungary and Golden Dawn in Greece - will win a clutch of seats but will be excluded from both these groups. The British Conservatives, with a ragbag of allies, will probably hold on to their separate mildly anti-European group, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR).\par \par \uc2 If you add a steep increase in hard left seats, more than one in three members of the new \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  will fervently wish that the institution did not exist. That is bizarre. But what will it mean?\par \par \uc2 Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the parliament is far more than a talking shop. It has done much to clean up its act. It has power to propose and amend European legislation.\par \par \uc2 It remains an odd beast - impressive as the only supranational, democratic institution in the world; ignored because it lacks the aura and legitimacy of popular understanding or interest.\par \par \uc2 Ms Le Pen says that she hopes to have a "blocking minority" to prevent any further legislation which dilutes national sovereignty. In practise, no such blocking minority exists in the parliament's rules. The anti-Europeans will be heavily outnumbered by the "pro-Europeans" of the centre-right (European People's Party), Socialists, Liberals and Greens.\par \par \uc2 The disparate "antis", from the neo-Nazis to the Tories, will still find many opportunities for sabotage. Whether they will be able to work together to exploit those opportunities is open to question. One area in which they could be influential - and might paradoxically please many of the member states - is in the choice of the next President of the European Commission.\par \par \uc2 The rules are ambiguous. Member states select the candidate but that the parliament endorses or reject the governments' nominee. According to the Treaty of Lisbon, the results of this week's elections must be "taken into account".\par \par \uc2 The parliament's leaders insist that this means that each political group has the right to present a candidate for Commission president in this week's election. The champion of the group which wins the most seats should, they say, be endorsed by the member states as the next head of the Brussels executive.\par \par \uc2 This implies a straight fight between the centre-right candidate, Jean-Claude Juncker (former Prime Minister of Luxembourg) and the Socialist candidate, and Parliament president, Martin Schulz, from Germany.\par \par \uc2 The other candidates mentioned earlier, represent the Liberals, Greens and hard left. These groups have no realistic chance of coming first this weekend. Polls suggest that Mr Juncker's EPP should narrowly pip the Socialists with just over 200 seats each.\par \par \uc2 Most of the big member states reject this interpretation of the treaty. They insist that they are free to cast their net more widely. The parliament threatens to reject any nominee who did not run in the European elections.\par \par \uc2 The scene is set for a stonking Euro-row, in which the anti-European third of the new assembly could easily play a significant and mischievous role, delaying a decision indefinitely.\par \par \uc2 This may seem a sterile debate but it goes to the heart of one of the great conundrums in European politics. There can be no real, direct democracy in Europe until European citzens think in European terms. Voters will not think in European terms until there is Europe-wide democracy. This weeks' election was supposed to start, timidly, to resolve that conundrum. It is likely to leave it as impenetrable as ever.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140521ea5l00014\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News | Sketch\par \par \uc2 It remains to be seen whether Winston McKenzie's description of Croydon - "unsafe" and "a dump" were only part of it - will win him votes as a Ukip candidate in the council elections. In Croydon. But no doubt he needed such terms to explain the unscheduled non-appearance of Nigel Farage at what had been billed as a "carnival rally" in the precincts of the Whitgift shopping centre.\par \par \uc2 OK, not everything had gone to plan. The Endurance steel band - engaged to demonstrate that the party was not racist - packed up when the leader, Marlon Hibbert, discovered they were here for Ukip, which McKenzie, himself black, had omitted to mention when he hired them. There was a small group of East European women, brandishing signs declaring "We are Romanians, and we don't feel comfortable with your racism", and the pithier: "Ukip modern Nazi party". And though both groups were outnumbered by journalists there were almost as many opponents as supporters noisily waiting for the supposed front-runner.\par \par \uc2 And waiting. Nigel Farage had been due at 2.30pm. But it was around 3.40pm when the voluble McKenzie announced that "Mr Farage, my leader, has weighed up the situation\u8230\'20\'26 and probably decided not to come down here today." He explained that Croydon had "progressively deteriorated" and had under the Coalition "descended into depravity". We looked around; one or two bystanders might have enjoyed a lunchtime drink. But this seemed over the top. However he added: "He wouldn't have felt safe, and can you blame him?"\par \par \uc2 Given a police presence, this was surely doubtful. A more likely explanation was the embarrassment of Endurance Steel cancelling their gig. The dignified Hibbert, 22, said quietly that his parents "came over from Jamaica to work. If Ukip had their way I would not be here. The country would be not so diverse."\par \par \uc2 Whatever the reason, Farage's absence triggered an intensity of street-level political argument that would have shamed a party leaders' TV debate. In one vigorous exchange with Colin Perera, a local Ukip-supporting businessman who said he was married to a Pole and used East European contractors, a Romanian woman said \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  came here because this was "rich country" and added: "These people are desperate and everything they want is to come here and clean your toilets."\par \par \uc2 And in a running argument with McKenzie, who to his credit ignored the advice of other Ukip supporters not to engage, Anthony St Croix, 26, working in black community radio on a career break from a local bank, was contemptuous of Ukip's recruitment of "one or two" Afro-Caribbeans. "This is divide and conquer. But there are young people here who are smart and educated. They will not follow them like sheep."\par \par \uc2 Farage was rumoured to be lurking nearby. One white middle-aged Ukip supporter repeatedly said his car was in the shopping centre car park. But it hardly mattered. Say what you like about the Ukip leader. There are few British politicians who could arrange such an interesting afternoon by not showing up.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140521ea5l0000h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News | Editorials Brussels has a legitimacy problem. Tomorrow's opportunity to do something about it should not be squandered\par \par \uc2 In its crudest, most regrettable form, the question being asked of voters ahead of tomorrow's \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  election is this: are you worried about the possibility of a Romanian family moving in next door? The data shows that only a vanishingly small percentage of the country would find themselves in that position (the number of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania in the workforce in fact dropped since restrictions were lifted last year). But that is the prospect that Nigel Farage has highlighted in order to scare up the anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , anti-EU vote.\par \par \uc2 It is alarming that such tactics may well work, given the rather hazy understanding in the broader electorate of what exactly the EU Parliament gets up to in Strasbourg. It is possible that a large proportion of voters will mark their ballot paper tomorrow - in both the European and council elections - to reflect their feelings not about issues that MEPs and local councillors can address, but about the performance of the national parties since 2010. Given the volume of national political bickering in this country, and the relatively muted EU and local campaigning, this is perhaps understandable. But these are crucial elections in their own right.\par \par \uc2 The democratic legitimacy of Europe's Parliament has been on the wane since its first election in 1979, with EU-wide voter turnout tomorrow expected to fall below the 43 per cent of five years ago. Meanwhile, Ukip is not the only party encouraging those who do show up to snub the very principle of a \uc2 European Union\uc2 : in eight of the 28 member states - including three founding members of the EU in France, the Netherlands and Italy - populists and far-right parties are in the running for a top-two finish. Low voter turnout will only play into the hands of such rejectionists, who, if they turn up in Parliament at all, can be expected to offer little but obstruction and expenses claims.\par \par \uc2 There is, however, no question that the EU needs reform. The union began life as an historic attempt to bring advanced nations together through economic ties. More recently, particularly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, it has encroached on the political sovereignty of nation states - which remain the most workable units of global order.\par \par \uc2 Both David Cameron and, to a far lesser degree, Ed Miliband, have talked of drawing back power, particularly in the areas of welfare policy and employment rules. A UK whose MEPs do not seek to undermine the European project at every turn is one better placed to engage in such discussions. (Scepticism is welcome in the right places - the Parliament's expenses gravy train, for one, deserves a proper inspection.)\par \par \uc2 Yet some of the largest and most complex contemporary problems require trans-national political responses - and the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  has great influence on the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 , the civil service body which puts together EU law. Following the Lisbon Treaty of 2009, the head of the Commission will need to be vouched for by the Parliament, where previously the decision was solely down to national governments who make up the European Council.\par \par \uc2 In their plenary sessions, MEPs will also have a say on cross-border issues from finance to terrorism to migration policy. Some 90 per cent of what the EU does must run through Strasbourg. On climate change, for example, the UK's 73 MEPs will influence the level at which future EU emissions targets are set. Quite simply the Parliament is more powerful than most national legislatures. A vote for a candidate who promises properly to engage with it is a vote that recognises the inter-connected nature of progressive European society.\par \par \uc2 That said, for many voters, the council election will have a more observable effect on day-to-day life. The temptation to use a vote to strike out at the Coalition or Labour's recent record should again be resisted, and the focus kept local. The time for a referendum on Messrs Cameron, Miliband and co awaits in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140521ea5l00002\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 Britain may need border controls if Scots go it alone\b0\par\par\uc2 By KEVIN SCHOFIELD, Chief Political Correspondent   \par \uc2 354 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par 03:36\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd.

Asked if he thought the party was racist, he said: "From what I've heard, yes."\par \par \uc2 "My parents came over here from Jamaica to work. If Ukip had their way I would not be here. The country would be a lot less diverse than it is," he said.\par \par \uc2 As the event descended into farce, Winston McKenzie, a former boxer and a Ukip candidate for \uc2 Croydon council\uc2 , explained that his home town was "a dump" and too "unsafe" for Mr Farage to visit.\par \par \uc2 "It's not a case of being scared but you have a responsibility as a family man and a party leader: there are certain situations you have to avoid." Although Mr McKenzie repeatedly insisted that Mr Farage was about to turn up, the Ukip leader later denied that he had ever intended to visit.\par \par \uc2 The chaotic event, held in the town centre of Croydon, was intended by Mr Farage to be a riposte to claims that he has pursued a racist campaign with his -criticisms of Romanian \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - an allegation he categorically denies.\par \par \uc2 But even Mr Farage's critics do not believe that any of this is likely to damage Ukip ahead of tomorrow's local and European elections; Mr McKenzie predicted: "The earthquake is coming."\par \par \uc2 Throughout the campaign Conservative and Labour officials have trawled through the \uc2 Twitter\uc2  accounts of Ukip -candidates, hoping to substantiate \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's characterisation of the party as a refuge for -"fruitcakes and closet -racists".\par \par \uc2 To some extent the tactic has been successful: Mr Farage has found himself defending Ukip against the charge that it is racist, a claim taken up enthusiastically by pro-Conservative newspapers and some broadcasters.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage squirmed in an LBC interview when asked to justify why Londoners might worry if Romanians moved in next door; he blamed the prevalence of Romanian criminal gangs.\par \par \uc2 "There's an opportunity cost for him," said one Tory strategist. "While he's spending time saying he's not a racist, that means he has less time to get his message across.\par \par \uc2 "It is also starting to -contaminate the Ukip brand. People don't want to be associated with a party that might be seen as racist - they hesitate, they don't want to give them money."\par \par \uc2 But that may be wishful thinking. Even the most optimistic Tory campaigners admit that any such damage to Ukip is "a slow burner", unlikely to do much damage to the party's share of the vote in tomorrow's elections.\par \par \uc2 Prime minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  has admitted as much, telling colleagues that the Tories cannot expect to beat Ukip in European elections: "It's like a pub quiz and they're playing their joker on their specialist round."\par \par \uc2 But Mr Cameron's hope is that Ukip's support will fade away at the next general election, when the Tories will warn rightwing voters that a Ukip vote could let in Labour.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage's advance is also being watched with concern by Ed Miliband. The Labour leader can see the party's working-class supporters seeping away to Ukip in urban areas.\par \par \uc2 Patrick O'Flynn, Ukip's communications chief, has claimed that his party may already have "maxed out the Tory vote" and that it is coming for Labour.\par \par \uc2 Inside Mr Miliband's team, a fierce debate is raging about the extent to which Labour tries to address the threat by toughening its stance on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and welfare; neither approach sits easily with Mr Miliband's political vision.\par \par \uc2 What is unknown is whether Ukip can achieve during the next 12 months what it has never achieved before: turning headline-grabbing results in European elections into -success at a Westminster poll.\par \par \uc2 The party's record suggests not. In the European elections of 2004 and 2009, Ukip recorded a vote share of 16 per cent, but this subsequently collapsed to 2 per cent and 3 per cent in the general elections that followed a year later.\par \par \uc2 This time may be different. The Farage phenomenon has taken off and could take Ukip on an unpredictable trajectory, with uncertain implications for Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband.\par \par \uc2 Turbulent record\par \par \uc2 16.2%\par \par \uc2 UK Independence party's share of the vote in the 2004 European elections\par \par \uc2 2.2%\par \par \uc2 Ukip's share of the vote in the 2005 general election\par \par \uc2 16.5%\par \par \uc2 Ukip's share in the 2009 European elections\par \par \uc2 3.1%\par \par \uc2 Ukip's share in the 2010 general election\par \par \uc2 24%\par \par \uc2 Ukip's share in the latest YouGov poll on European election voting intentions\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140521ea5l00010\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NATIONAL NEWS\par \b \uc2 Tory leader optimistic on keeping control of urban stronghold; Trafford\b0\par\par\uc2 By Andrew Bounds in Sale   \par \uc2 702 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFTA\par \uc2 London Ed1\par 02\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Sean Anstee is not your typical Conservative. He is 26, gay, but, rarest of all, runs a city council in the north, writes Andrew Bounds in Sale .\par \par \uc2 Trafford is the last blue urban stronghold in the region after swing cities such as Leeds and Carlisle have fallen to Labour in the past few years.\par \par \uc2 Mr Anstee believes the party can hold on to the district south of Manchester, which includes expensive suburbs such as Hale and Altrincham as well as grittier Stretford.\par \par \uc2 "We have the lowest council tax in the northwest, the lowest parking charges in Greater Manchester, excellent grammar schools and good services." Conservatives in the north had "a responsibility to get our message out", he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Anstee, who trained as a banker and still holds down an occasional job at \uc2 Bank of New York Mellon\uc2  in Manchester, said his age had not been a factor on the doorstep.\par \par \uc2 "We have got to get young people involved in politics. But I don't want to be defined by my age. I want to get things done for Trafford," he said.\par \par \uc2 He won the Conservative leadership in an election in January after \uc2 Matt Colledge\uc2  stood down over time pressure.\par \par \uc2 He admitted delivering cuts was a "challenge" but has made a virtue of it, with a plan to privatise much service delivery and by working in partnership with the police, \uc2 National Health Service\uc2  and charities by sharing offices and budgets.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot just throw money at problems. We have to work better. Labour councils do not cope well with austerity," he said.\par \par \uc2 Trafford has cut \u163\'00\'A360m of spending in the past four years and its revenue budget will decrease by a further \u163\'00\'A350m over the next four years. "If a council is not adding value to a service, it will have to stop," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Labour party is playing down its chances of seizing Trafford but believes it can deny the Tories a majority.\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives have 33 seats, Labour 26 and the Lib Dems four, with 21 contested this time. "We are targeting four seats and aim to move it to no overall control," said David Acton, opposition leader on the council. He said residents had felt service cuts.\par \par \uc2 The council has closed residential homes for the elderly and children's day centres while libraries are being staffed mostly by volunteers, with bin collections moved from weekly to fortnightly.\par \par \uc2 The closure of the local hospital's accident and emergency department and some bus routes were also big factors in the election, as well as the so-called bedroom tax cutting housing benefit for those with a spare room.\par \par \uc2 In St Mary's ward, where Labour lost by only 19 votes last time, candidate James Wright received a generally sympathetic hearing.\par \par \uc2 "We could do with a change," said David Mayon, a pensioner, promising to vote Labour as he talks to Mr Wright over the garden fence.\par \par \uc2 Patricia Daly, a housewife, was not so certain. "I don't want false promises," she said. "You all tell us what you are going to do and then don't do it."\par \par \uc2 Political distrust remains rife after years of expenses scandals. On the street of semi-detached homes at least 10 undecided voters committed themselves to Labour.\par \par \uc2 But there are signs of growing support for the UK Independence party.\par \par \uc2 Rob, a retired firefighter behind the wheel of a Land Rover, said he was a Labour voter but would switch to Ukip in protest at rising \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and falling living standards. "I am doing garden maintenance to give my son \u163\'00\'A3400 a month to pay for university. None of the big parties is any different to another." He did not think Nigel Farage's infamous comments about Romanians causing crime were racist. "He's just saying the truth. All the other parties are frightened."\par \par \uc2 Dave, a serving firefighter, said he would stick with the Liberal Democrats as Ukip did not have a coherent set of policies. But he said he and his wife, a teacher, were getting poorer every year. "The Tories just look after the southeast," he said.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140521ea5l0000w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Let's face it: we are living through the most important phase of British politics - indeed, British society - since Margaret Thatcher's first government. Everything seems uncertain: the result of the next election, the long-term fate of all three main parties, the reputation of such British institutions as the BBC, the police, and the \uc2 NHS\uc2  - and the future of the United Kingdom itself.\par \par \uc2 The relentless modern news media has a tendency to make even the most convulsive events look like just another item on the "breaking news" ticker. But the importance of the debate about Scottish independence, which is reverberating throughout the whole of the UK, is clearly massive. Recent polls have put the pro-independence side only a few points behind the "no" camp.\par \par \uc2 In early May, a source close to \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  served notice that if the pro-independence side won, he would not resign as prime minister, which spoke volumes about where we have somehow arrived: facing a once-unthinkable scenario, senior politicians are matter-of-factly considering their options.\par \par \uc2 Whatever happens in the September referendum will have profound consequences. All three main UK parties are now of the opinion that if it sticks with the union, Scotland should be given more powers over its affairs, and as and when that happens - let alone if Scotland decides to split away - the imbalanced nature of the UK's governing arrangements will be revealed as never before. The long-ticking question is about to explode: if it's so important for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland people to have increased control over their affairs, what about people in England?\par \par \uc2 Political anoraks refer back to the so-called West Lothian question, named in honour of the late Labour MP Tam Dalyell, who first raised the point in a debate about devolution in 1977. Back then, his point remained hypothetical, but it sat under British politics like a time bomb: "For how long will English constituencies and English honourable members tolerate . . . at least 119 honourable members from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland exercising an important, and probably often decisive, effect on English politics while they themselves have no say in the same matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?" Thirty-seven years on, we are getting used to people talking about "English votes for English laws", an English parliament, and giving English voters an increased say via a new kind of regional government.\par \par \uc2 The last of those ideas was floated by the previous government, only for a plan for an elected regional assembly in the north-east to be resoundingly defeated in 2004, whereupon everything went quiet. Now, a new Yorkshire First party has just been launched, arguing that "Yorkshire has a larger population than Scotland and an economy twice the size of Wales, but . . . the powers of neither."\par \par \uc2 In the north east, despite what happened a decade ago, something similar is said to be on its way. The same restive mood was highlighted last month, when the EU formally granted the people of Cornwall "national minority" status, and there was renewed talk about giving that county - the poorest in the UK - much more control over the spending of European regeneration money.\par \par \uc2 There are other signs of a new, uncertain era. A revival of passions about England has been obvious in things that have looked unremarkable but are freighted with political meaning: the splurge of documentaries about national history and geography, the revival of interest in English folk, increasing celebration of St George's Day. Ideas about what this might mean for England's future identity vary wildly. One long-standing school of thought goes back to The Break-Up Of Britain, a prescient book written by Scottish political theorist Tom Nairn in 1977. In this view of things, Britain and the UK are concepts loaded down with the stuff of empire and colonialism, which all four countries in the UK should shrug off. As Nairn put it, the English perhaps need to "reinvent an identity . . . better than the battered, cliche-ridden hulk which the retreating tide of imperialism has left them". Recently, a crisply phrased version of this view was dispensed by Scottish author Irvine Welsh: "England had a mission to be an inclusive multicultural nation and this old-fashioned imperialist UK has stopped it from fulfilling its national destiny." (Scots often seem to be the most vociferous mouthpieces of this theory - viewed from a certain perspective, they may be open to the charge that they are simply trying to make themselves feel better about leaving the rest of us in the lurch).\par \par \uc2 By contrast, other people see a "British" identity encompassing a huge range of people, as against an Englishness that is too often crabby and xenophobic. In the census of 2011 - the first to ask people to tick boxes for their national identity (or identities) - 60% of people in England described themselves as English only, but there were fascinating variations swirling around that number. Perhaps most interestingly, in England, 38% of people from an ethnic minority said they were exclusively British, as against only 14% of white people, and the ethnic groups in England most likely to say they were British were Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and people who trace their background to India. It's not difficult to interpret those differences: for many people, Britain is an inclusive, outward-looking place, but a solitary England would represent something much more problematic.\par \par \uc2 In this reading, the first word in "English Defence League" has a sharp significance. So does the existence of the English Democrats, a rather nasty pro-English political party who advocate an English parliament and the honouring of\par \par \uc2 St George's Day with a public holiday, and wage\par \par \uc2 war on "political correctness" and "mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 " - they're a kind of Poundland Ukip,\par \par \uc2 said to have been infiltrated by former members of the BNP.\par \par \uc2 And then there is Ukip itself: the conduit for a specifically English political revolt, and full of people who highlight the notion of England as an angry, introverted place. In this England, there is seething resentment about differences in public spending north of the border, the press whips\par \par \uc2 up hysteria about halal meat, and millions of\par \par \uc2 us want out of Europe, as quickly as possible.\par \par \uc2 If Nigel Farage - who, when he was last asked, supported the case for an English parliament - and his people top the poll in this week's European elections, that view of England will only be given more credence, which will perhaps push Scotland even closer to breaking point.\par \par \uc2 There is now a small library of books that examine all this, among the most impressive of which is The Politics Of English Nationhood, written by London-based academic Michael Kenny.\par \par \uc2 "That image of an insular, sour, grievance-fuelled Englishness - that dominates a lot of liberal worries about perceptions of Englishness," he says. "But I'm sceptical about whether that's the dominant strand of English identity. I certainly think it's become more prominent, and Ukip have emerged to express it. But there's also a quieter kind of everyday small 'c' conservatism, which has attached itself to a sceptical view of the unions to which England belongs, and a growing disaffection with politics and politicians. It's complicated: that isn't necessarily the same thing as the mood that Ukip speaks to.\par \par \uc2 "And there's something else going on as well: a number of different attempts to put together a more liberal, multicultural face. That's the weakest one, but it's there. All those faces are at play, but there hasn't been any political engagement with them."\par \par \uc2 He warns: "The debate for people who support the union is whether it's becoming more damaging to cross your fingers and hope that Englishness will go away, or think about engaging with it constructively. But whatever happens in Scotland in September, all this will come on to the agenda."\par \par \uc2 Voices outside the political right - whether you call them "progressive", "liberal", "on the left" or whatever else - have long had difficulty dealing with questions about England. They have largely welcomed the rise of new, inclusive kinds of national identity in Scotland and Wales, but for some reason, the prospect of anything comparable happening in the UK's biggest country is still viewed with suspicion. "We see patriotism as essentially pathological," a senior Labour figure tells me. "It's something to do with the mob. And we're scared by it."\par \par \uc2 Among people grouped in and around Labour, there is also a deep-seated anxiety about whether or not England is a conservative country, with both a small and a large "c". The electoral evidence is ambiguous: the Tories won more English votes than Labour at the last two general elections, though Labour optimists are fond of pointing out that of the 18 general elections since 1945, only three would have produced different results in Scotland's absence.\par \par \uc2 Whatever, even if the creation of an English parliament remains unlikely, the likelihood is that we will soon be talking about new, England-focused arrangements within the UK parliament (promised by the Tories in their last manifesto, and which might leave any Labour government with only a slender grip on day-to-day business), or the need to disperse power around the English regions. There will also be an inevitable discussion about values, history and culture. Are people on the liberal left prepared to let England be defined as the country of kings and queens, Victorian values, the Anglican church, Margaret Thatcher, Downton Abbey and Nigel Farage? Or might they finally talk about the place that produced the Diggers and Ranters, the Tolpuddle Martyrs, nonconformist Christianity, Clement Attlee, Two Tone - and great cities that are now the absolute embodiment of everything the Farage-ists take against?\par \par \uc2 Billy Bragg has been discussing questions about England for well over a decade, in both his writing and songs. In 2002, he released England, Half English, an album that stole its title from George Orwell, and was adorned with a St George's flag. Its title track found him tentatively exploring what his home country was, and is: "My mother was half English and I'm half English too/I'm a great big bundle of culture tied up in the red white and blue/I'm a fine example of your Essex man/And I'm well familiar with the Hindustan/'Cos my neighbours are half-English, and I'm half-English too."\par \par \uc2 "We've got no reason to hide behind the Union Jack," he says. "If that period has passed, and the Scots go, and ultimately, the Welsh decide to go too, we need a civic renewal in England. And I've got a lot of faith in English people being able to do that."\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Could power\par \par \uc2 be devolved to English regions including the north east?\par \par \uc2 'Scottish devolution\par \par \uc2 has played a part in the rise in Englishness'\par \par \uc2 'Instead of\par \par \uc2 HS2, I'd locate\par \par \uc2 the English parliament in the north'\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140520ea5l00071\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Plymouth: Labour encounters emotion and anger on the doorstep\b0\par\par\uc2 John Harris   \par \uc2 1,040 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The door of the bungalow swings open, and the woman who answers it - she works for \uc2 Plymouth city council\uc2  so will not give her name - looks indifferently at a Labour party leaflet. "I'm a grafter," she says. "You're not doing nothing for me."\par \par \uc2 Then her husband appears. Brian Wilson, a 68-year-old retired council cleaner and lifelong Labour voter, is clearly annoyed. "Mr Farage is the only one telling the truth about Europe," he says. In vain, a solitary Labour party canvasser tries to start a forensic discussion about Ukip's free market economics and Farage's belief in flat taxes - but it sounds like emotion and raw anger being met with clinical policy wonkery, to nobody's great benefit.\par \par \uc2 We're in the Stoke council ward, west of Plymouth city centre. Wilson's local Ukip candidate, I tell him, has been the subject of reports about his somewhat out-there activities on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 : online membership of two far-right groups, as well as his apparent endorsement of a defamatory essay linking Prince Charles - via Jimmy Savile - to paedophilia. What does he make of all that?\par \par \uc2 "I can't really say," he says. "All I'm going by is what they say on Europe . . . anyway, you only know what you've been told. They're just getting a bad press, that's all."\par \par \uc2 Unlike those swaths of the south-west where the Liberal Democrats are the chief anti-Conservative force, Plymouth has long been split between Labour and the Tories; its place in the English left's mythology going back to that renowned native of Plymouth, Michael Foot. He was an MP here between 1945 and 1955, before that infamous splitter \uc2 David Owen\uc2  eventually took over.\par \par \uc2 With 32 seats out of 57, Labour has run the city council since 2012 and, with the 19 wards under contention tomorrow being evenly split between the two main parties, its people are looking to increase their grip.\par \par \uc2 Ukip is running a full slate of candidates, and talking up its chances. At the last European elections Farage's party finished first in Plymouth, and even Labour expects it to do the same again; the more interesting question is whether Ukip will take any seats on the city council. Labour high-ups are adamant that if that happens it will be Tory seats that go, while others see the city as a case study in Labour's overlooked vulnerability to the same threat.\par \par \uc2 The pored-over academic treatise Revolt on the Right identifies Labour-held Plymouth Moor View (one of the city's two Labour/Tory marginals) as one of the top five parliamentary seats that might be vulnerable to Ukip. This is traceable to the seat's demographics - essentially, a preponderance of what the book calls "left behind" voters - and what has happened there electorally: in 2010 Ukip managed a creditable 7.7% of the vote, and at the last city council elections the party got 20% of the poll.\par \par \uc2 By way of proving that all this is being taken very seriously, on the day of my visit there is a Ukip public meeting at the guildhall in the city centre. But, as if to confirm the party also has work to do, it's a somewhat damp squib: around 30 people listen to Tony McIntyre, a candidate for the European parliament, talking about what he inelegantly calls "the \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  problem we've got in this country".\par \par \uc2 The leader of the city council is Labour's Tudor Evans. He traces Ukip's local strength to "a huge strand of Euroscepticism", but insists that if it advances, it will be at the expense of the Tories. "We know that Ukip are taking votes off the Labour party," he tells me, "but they're taking more votes off the Tory party. That's all we need to happen: as long as we can maintain our share of the vote, we're ahead."\par \par \uc2 If a few hours of canvassing is anything to go by, plenty of habitual Labour voters will dutifully turn out this week. It may be some measure of internal jitters that among the piles of mail shots at Labour's HQ is one aimed at people thinking of voting Green. None of this seems to augur well for 2015; if there is going to be what Westminster insiders call a "change moment", it will somehow have to arrive very late in the electoral day.\par \par \uc2 So it proves in Southway, a post-war housing development half an hour's bus ride from the middle of Plymouth, in the Moor View constituency. Graham Elsworth, a retired Royal Marine tending his garden, says he has already voted by post, but won't be drawn on who got it. When I mention the prospect of local people voting Ukip, he issues a curt verdict. "They would do, wouldn't they? Because they're pissed off."\par \par \uc2 On the other side of his fence is 42-year-old Karen Mackenzie. "Think about all the factories we used to have round here," she says. "We ain't got nothing now. All anyone's doing is building more and more houses."\par \par \uc2 Around the corner is a forlorn-looking shopping centre. Outside the Co-op supermarket is 77-year-old Michael Nanfield, a retired store manager who once voted Labour but is now thinking about supporting Ukip. He mentions Farage - "He's a character, isn't he? I've got my doubts about him as well, mind" - and his own gripes with the EU: red tape, its fisheries policies and what the UK's membership means for \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He then talks about Ed Miliband. "Let's be honest: he hasn't got a clue," he says. "He hasn't got a clue. Public school, isn't he?" Actually, no, I tell him. He went to a comprehensive school.\par \par \uc2 Nanfield's eyes scrunch up slightly, and he shoots me a look with which any political journalist will be familiar, conveying the idea that anyone who defends mainstream politicians must be part of the same odious conspiracy. "Really? How do you know that? Are you related to him?"\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140520ea5l0006h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

Will it work come polling day, asks Patrick Wintour: Nigel Farage on ...\b0\par\par\uc2 2,059 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage is coming to the end of a period of probably the most intensive scrutiny any unelected British politician has faced in decades, and with his opponents hoping that in the final few days his mask has slipped to reveal if not something dark, at least a buffoon, or better someone that unashamedly manipulates truths to feed fear and garner votes.\par \par \uc2 No one can accuse Farage of hiding. He has done all the tough interviews, and is confident that the recent flurry of calling him a racist has backfired since the public do not see him as such. It is a finding that Labour and Tory polling has also picked up. Farage himself believes voters will realise he has been subjected to a disproportionate media barrage. Almost as a result, he believes he is still on course to create the long forecast political earthquake when the European election results are revealed next Sunday.\par \par \uc2 If he has succeeded, one reason will be the simplicity of his message, and his self-discipline. Ukip, unlike the BNP, travels light. There is little complex ideology or historical philosophy, no discussion on England's spiritual roots, few tracts on national identity, and no critiques of elitist democracy penned by a Ukip court ideologue.\par \par \uc2 His lodestar is nostalgia not Nietzsche. Ukip is not neo-fascist, but - in Farage's own description - a patriotic party with a small p. Farage would not go near a balcony, save probably to be lean over and be ill. As a result much of the assault on Ukip has been directed less at him personally, or his thinking, and instead diverted to the homophobes, Islamophobes, white imperialists and eccentrics that have stood, or tried to stand under Ukip's purple. The midnight thoughts of his supporters on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  have fed newspapers every day. Farage just brushes them aside as the irrelevant idiots and oddballs that latch onto any new political movement.\par \par \uc2 Throughout the campaign he has tried to stick rigidly to a simple dual-track message: Britain's communities are being overwhelmed by \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and the \uc2 British government\uc2  can do nothing about this so long as Britain remains in the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , a membership Ukip will end through a referendum.\par \par \uc2 By combining the emotive message about migrants with the abstractions of British sovereignty, the revolt on the right has become the revolt of the disenchanted. He explained the importance of the duality in an interview last year. He said "They [the voters] have made the connection. It took me bloody years to get \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and Europe together, but I knew at the local elections this year it was now the same thing."\par \par \uc2 The message discipline on this has been very tight. So he told LBC: "It is completely pointless to talk about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  figures and targets while we're members of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , when we have a total open door to nearly half a billion people. We have an open door not just to 28 million from Romania and Bulgaria, 485 million people effectively now have British passports, they can all come to live in this country and so actually nobody can have an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy, nobody can project or predict what will happen all the while we stay part of the EU. 485 million people can come and live here, every single one of them if they want to."\par \par \uc2 He has tried to suppress everything not to do with this dual argument. Thus, well before the elections, he made it clear that Ukip would be providing no domestic policy, even though it has nearly 2,000 candidates in local elections across the country.\par \par \uc2 Ukip's local elections manifesto, launched away from the scrutiny of Westminster reporters, is a glossy vacuity, promising referenda, weekly bin collections, no more wind farms and a promise to look at the case for shale gas. On housing, the party opposes Stalinist planning.\par \par \uc2 When Farage was asked by the BBC presenter Andrew Neil about the party's myriad plans for tax cuts, he said: "I'm not talking about any of those things." Neil persisted by suggesting the party would cut fuel duty and Farage replied: "No, I'm not talking about any of those things. I'm fighting a European election. That is the election we're fighting, that election's all about the \uc2 European Union\uc2 ." He later said: "We have not agreed a manifesto for the general election. We will do over the summer."\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Farage has made a virtue of Ukip being a blank piece of paper, repeatedly ridiculing the Ukip manifesto written for the last election. He said "it was drivel, 486 pages of drivel, I didn't read it, nor did the party leader, it was a nonsense, and we've put that behind us and moved on to a professional footing. I said, I want the whole lot taken down off the website, we reject the whole thing, we'll start again with a blank sheet of paper."\par \par \uc2 The blankness of Faragism helps the party forestall internal divisions and remain attractive simultaneously to disillusioned Labour in the north and disillusioned Tories in the south. When extraneous issues have emerged in the campaign with which he is uneasy, his tactic has been to prevaricate. Asked whether he supported gay marriage Farage, once a libertarian, has avoided an answer by saying: "It is a can of worms."\par \par \uc2 He said while Britain remained a signatory to the European convention on human rights - not an EU body - there was a very big risk that the Church of England would be dragged through the courts in Strasbourg and possibly forced to conduct gay marriages against the will of the vast majority of churchgoers.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, on his EU allowances he has slithered around, promising an independent audit if it would settle the argument, then saying he would be not be singled out for a higher level of scrutiny and then backtracking when it was pointed out that Labour, Tory and Liberal Democrat MEPs all have their allowances audited independently. He now says Ukip MEPs will decide collectively if they should have allowances audited. A retrospective audit of his own spending is no longer offered.\par \par \uc2 But the mask has slipped somewhat over foreign policy. Just before the first LBC Europe debate with Nick Clegg, he sided with \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  to claim it was probable that the chemical weapon attacks was mounted by Syrian rebels and not agents of President Assad.\par \par \uc2 Asked by Alastair Campbell, the former Labour communication chief, to name the politician he most admired, he chose Putin, and such is his hatred of EU foreign policy he found himself condemning the Ukrainian revolutionaries as credulous creatures of the European commission. "We have given a false series of hopes to a group of people in the western Ukraine, so geed up were they that they actually toppled their own elected leader," he said. "That provoked Mr Putin, and I think the \uc2 European Union\uc2  frankly does have blood on its hands in the Ukraine".\par \par \uc2 But it has been over cultural issues that Farage sounded more sinister than a saloon bar stockbroker. In his speech to the Ukip annual conference in Torbay, he said: "Whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don't hear English spoken any more, this is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren."\par \par \uc2 Questioned about this at a subsequent press conference, Farage waxed lyrical about a lost Metroland: "Do I think parts of Britain are a foreign land? I got the train the other night, it was rush hour, from Charing Cross. It was a stopper going out and we stopped at London Bridge, New Cross, Hither Green, it was not till we got past Grove Park that I could hear English being audibly spoken in the carriage.\par \par \uc2 "Does that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes it does. I wonder what is really going on. I am saying that and I am sure that is a view that will be reflected by three-quarters of the population, perhaps even more."\par \par \uc2 That in turn has led to the growing contortions over Romanians and Bulgarians. Ukip posters appeared warning that 29 million Romanians and Bulgarians were after your job, and he has repeatedly highlighted the criminality of Romania.\par \par \uc2 In a Guardian interview, he said it was not just about numbers of Romanians but quality, adding: "People hate talking about this, but if you look at the Met crime figures for Romanian arrests, there have been 28,000 in London in the last five years. Is there a problem? Yeah. There is a problem."\par \par \uc2 Was he saying there is a culture of criminality among Romanians? He replied "Bound to be. You have to go and see it to understand it. I've visited camps in Romania and Bulgaria, I've got a pretty good understanding."\par \par \uc2 He was then asked "Should British people be wary of Romanian families moving into their street? Farage replied "Ask David Blunkett." The Guardian pressed him to answer and he replied: "Well of course, yeah."\par \par \uc2 By now Farage was stereotyping, and made matters worse when James O'Brien on LBC asked him to explain the difference between living next door to Germans - like Farage's wife, Kirsten -and Romanians. Farage said: "You know what the difference is."\par \par \uc2 In the final days of his campaign, he has been in danger of losing the agenda, and appearing obsessive, taking out full-page adverts containing partial or anecdotal evidence to prove the criminality of Romanians in London. His difficulties are numerous.\par \par \uc2 The Met's own figures show there has been no spike in Romanian crime since labour market restrictions against Romania were lifted in January. Poles are more likely to commit crimes, the figures show. His claim that 92% of ATM crime is committed by Romanians is based on three-year-old unpublished intelligence reported by one retired policeman in a TV documentary.\par \par \uc2 Farage now says his claim that 7% of crimes are committed by Romanians should have been that 7% of criminal gangs are from Romania. He now admits the figure was simplified. He says he has "no problem with Romanians. I have a big problem with Romania."\par \par \uc2 Labour especially is likely to have an intense postmortem on whether it should have gone for Farage more aggressively earlier, or whether establishment name-calling has just solidified his vote. Either way, the biggest test is yet to come. It has been said challenger parties are like bees. Once they have stung the system, they die. Farage has a year to prove this wrong.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \par \par \uc2 'We have an open door not just to 28 million from Romania and Bulgaria, 485 million people now have British passports, they can all come to live in this country and so actually nobody can have an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy, nobody can project or predict what will happen all the while we stay part of the EU'\par \par \uc2 Ukraine\par \par \uc2 'We have given a false series of hopes to a group of people in the western Ukraine, so geed up were they that they actually toppled their own elected leader.

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Comment and Debate Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: There's no housing crisis, just a very British sickness: The daily calls to build new homes are based on meaningless data, with little reference to actual demand or existing stock\b0\par\par\uc2 Simon Jenkins simon.jenkins@theguardian.com   \par \uc2 1,122 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 31\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Housing booms are today's medieval plagues. Boils suppurate on the political backside. People rush to find culprits to lynch. Quacks appear on street corners with fake remedies. Reason takes a holiday.\par \par \uc2 Thus it was yesterday, as the Today programme's John Humphrys chided David Cameron for the "housing crisis" and for not building more houses in the Tory shires. It was like curing famine by sending caviar to Africa.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, everyone from Ed Miliband to the governor of the Bank of England screams crisis. There is a crisis when prices fall and a crisis when prices rise. Almost everywhere house prices are still bouncing along the bottom, but at London dinner parties they are a "bubble".\par \par \uc2 Most people would like a nicer house. That is not a "need" but rather a demand, and thus drives house prices in a free economy. But in Britain demand is not just for a nicer house: it is for an investment, a hedge against inflation and old age, a golden gate to otherwise impossible wealth. It is this that drives middle-income families into a frenzy, and has pushed up house prices in the south-east by some 9% in the past year.\par \par \uc2 Neil Monnery's Safe as Houses is one of the few sane books on the housing market I have read. It compares Britain's boom and bust with experience elsewhere in Europe. Germany is much richer than Britain, with ever rising wealth and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , and a cautious government. German house prices have actually fallen in real terms over half a century. There is a flourishing rental sector, regulated and with a degree of tenant security, while just 43% of Germans, mostly in middle age, own their homes. They invest their savings not in property but in productive industry, much to the benefit of the economy. Germany's housing stock, says Monnery, "is a stable, functional and affordable asset".\par \par \uc2 Or consider another housing pundit, Danny Dorling. His new book, All That Is Solid, emphasises that the central failing of British housing is chronic under-occupation, which is getting worse. The 1971 census return showed Britons enjoying 1.5 rooms per person. Today, with a larger population, the figure is 2.5. Small households were moving into larger properties and staying there, even when children fled the nest. The rich are simply storing money in surplus rooms.\par \par \uc2 Another economist, Rebecca Tunstall of York University, long ago stole a march on France's Thomas Piketty, in showing how housing has reflected income inequality. In 1981 the richest 10% of Britons had three times as many rooms as the poorest, while by 2011 the gap had widened to five times. The issue is wealth, not housing supply.\par \par \uc2 As Dorling concludes, "We cannot build our way out of the disaster of our current housing system." We should rather tackle "how to better share and look after what we have already got".\par \par \uc2 We still read daily nonsense about Britain "needing" to build 250,000 more houses a year to "hit a 1.1% inflation target" for annual price rises. These figures are near-meaningless. The need is based on crude household formation, with no reference to demand, price, migration or anything else.\par \par \uc2 Yet it is still seized on by newbuild lobbyists, such as the \uc2 Home Builders Federation\uc2  and Savills estate agency, eager to grab lucrative plots in the south-east. This in turn fuels panic about planning delays and drives young people into desperate over-borrowing.\par \par \uc2 A belief that more housebuilding nationwide will both meet "need" and drive down prices dates from the 2004 Barker review, which has guided policy ever since then. There is no proof of this thesis. As Monnery points out, more houses were indeed built, yet "real price increases actually jumped to 5-10% a year".\par \par \uc2 London also had a "crisis" in the seventies, when its population was plummeting. The reason was the same as in the United States and Australia, where houses were built with none of Britain's planning constraints and yet prices soared: reckless bank lending.\par \par \uc2 Building estates on greenfield sites - which is the current coalition policy - may delight free-market lobbyists and leftwingers eager to enrage rural Tories. But it wastes energy and infrastructure. It promotes commuting and destroys a dwindling environment. Housing "need" is in cities, where labour mobility and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  are high and most poor people find work. The rejection of Labour's brownfield-first planning policy was the crassest of coalition innovations.\par \par \uc2 I may not go so far as Dorling in declaring: "We have built enough homes." But he and others are surely right to refocus on demand. Britain has a huge stock of empty and underused residential space, public as well as private. It is why Iain Duncan Smith's "bedroom tax" was in the right direction, however hamfisted its implementation. Council tax should now extend the principle to the private sector.\par \par \uc2 A policy for housing supply cannot lie in Eric Pickles's "war on the councils", in Nick Clegg's garden cities, or in planning minister Nick Boles's skirmishing across Cotswold meadows to win a handful of town houses. It lies in retrofitting old cities to modern demands. It cannot make sense to leave urban land derelict, in the south as well as the north, while commuter corridors sprawl into the surrounding countryside.\par \par \uc2 The wasted space in inner Manchester or South Yorkshire is comparable only to eastern Europe. Inner London's employment density is similar to New York's, yet its housing density is less than half. Housing supply in inner cities will have to rise to counter this glaring mismatch. The poor are the true victims of today's locked minds and political tribalism. They have no "need" for executive homes in distant commuter land. They just want somewhere cheap to live, near work.\par \par \uc2 Everything in policy seems the wrong way round. Stamp duty discourages transactions just when they should be encouraged. Limiting VAT relief to new construction discourages urban renewal. Council tax is regressive when it should be progressive, with higher bands taxing space as well as value.\par \par \uc2 Councils should be set free to develop and manage their low-cost estates. Tax incentives should encourage renting, co-ops and sublets such as \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It may be true that income inequality lies at the root of housing inequality. As such both will always be with us. But housing policy should not make inequality worse.\par \par \uc2 simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140520ea5l00066\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Homeless man rescued after making his bed on top of an 80ft cliff... and rolling over the edge in his SLEEP\b0\par\par\uc2 CHRIS PLEASANCE   \par \uc2 346 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par 22:54\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

But I\u8217\'20\'19ll never forget that at the age of 15, with no one else around, he told me that I could go in the pool without my bikini on if I wanted to. I was repulsed.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Their friendship with Scott ended tragically for all three kids. By the time Scott was 19, he was out of control, had never held down a job and was living on his trust fund, according to Phillip.\par \par \uc2 He says that Scott became increasingly disillusioned with his own life and started to resent Phillip\u8217\'20\'19s loving family. So much so, that the pair came to blows in 1999 as Scott opened fire on Phillip with a Mossberg 500C 20-gauge shotgun.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I showed up at his house like I did most days,\u8217\'20\'19 Phiilip recalls. \u8216\'20\'18I even had a key. He was outside the back gate, and he came at me in a sideways direction. He said: \u8220\'20\'1CCome with me\u8221\'20\'1D, and ushered me into his backyard, then started pushing me. It got into a full on fight and I guess I won and said: \u8220\'20\'1COK, we\u8217\'20\'19re done.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I didn\u8217\'20\'19t push him any further and walked away. That\u8217\'20\'19s when he pulled a gun and I kept getting shot from behind. I was getting peppered. I thought he was going to finish me off, so ran outside the property. The doctors still don\u8217\'20\'19t know how I managed to run.\par \par \uc2 The Sterlings were not at home at the time.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I hid behind a car and crouched down so he couldn\u8217\'20\'19t see me. Thankfully, a girl came along in a car, I jumped in and she drove me to hospital. I had gun shot wounds in both legs, four holes in the left, eight holes in the right. I\u8217\'20\'19ve still got two bullets in my leg and I\u8217\'20\'19m disabled now.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It was caused by Scott\u8217\'20\'19s jealousy of my family and nobody gives a damn about him. He was even jealous of my friends.\u8217\'20\'19\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 At the time, it was reported that the fight was over young Saved by the Bell actress Lindsay McKeon, then 17, a friend of both the boys. McKeon has broken off relations with Scott, it was said, but he still had strong feelings for her. She had arrived at Scott\u8217\'20\'19s house to deliver a letter and when Phillip walked up to them jealous Scott went ballistic.\par \par \uc2 But Phillip maintains the fight had nothing to do with her. \u8216\'20\'18It was to do with his upbringing, \u8216\'20\'18 he says.\par \par \uc2 Unbelievably,\u160\'00\'A0 the pair remained friends.\u160\'00\'A0 Phillip was reluctant to press charges and Scott was never criminally prosecuted.\par \par \uc2 Phillip says: \u8216\'20\'18The police wanted to prosecute, but got shot down. I wasn\u8217\'20\'19t that cooperative because he was my friend. I just wanted to forget about it myself. I didn\u8217\'20\'19t want him to go to jail.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I won the civil suit and got some money out of it. I only did that after pressure from my own family. I even asked Scott what I should do and he said try to get some money out of it. I would have dropped it if he\u8217\'20\'19d have asked me to.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 But their friendship was left in tatters in October 2005 when Phillip\u8217\'20\'19s his sister Cheryl fell out of a three-storey high window at a party in Beverly Hills.\par \par \uc2 The Scheid family are convinced that Scott was to blame for her accident, which left her paralyzed.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It was the first time I\u8217\'20\'19d seen him for ten years,\u8217\'20\'19 Cheryl says.\u160\'00\'A0 \u8216\'20\'18I was at a friend\u8217\'20\'19s house and I saw Scott. He was dealing drugs to everyone and I was drugged. I don\u8217\'20\'19t know how, that\u8217\'20\'19s all I remember.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18His parents weren\u8217\'20\'19t giving him money apart from his trust fund, so Scott dealt drugs. I don\u8217\'20\'19t know how I fell out.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I had a major spinal chord injury. If the ambulance hadn\u8217\'20\'19t have picked me up in fifteen minutes, I\u8217\'20\'19d have died of internal bleeding. If the surgeon hadn\u8217\'20\'19t have operated within forty-five minutes, I wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be here.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19m now in a wheelchair for the rest of my life.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Cheryl says that police never investigated the case. She tried to file a lawsuit, but it was dismissed by the judge.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I have to live my life every day in a wheelchair. I fought for five years against the Sterling family and then had the lawsuit dismissed. They didn\u8217\'20\'19t even let me have a trial. Donald Sterling couldn\u8217\'20\'19t care less about my family, my future. He didn\u8217\'20\'19t give a cripple girl a dime.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18There was no witnesses to it, but Scott was there and it was Don\u8217\'20\'19s money and influence on his son that led to me being in a wheelchair.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Scott\u8217\'20\'19s life never got any better, say the brothers and sister, and he turned increasingly to drugs, which he succumbed to in January last year when he died of an overdose.\par \par \uc2 When Scott died, it was reported that Shelly Sterling\u160\'00\'A0 felt like her husband was more concerned with his mistress - the woman who helped bring him down - V. Stiviano, than grieving with the family.\par \par \uc2 Phillip and Cheryl don\u8217\'20\'19t ever blame Scott for all this, but his father. They\u8217\'20\'19re slowly rebuilding their lives and still live in Los Angeles. It\u8217\'20\'19s because of her experience that Cheryl is writing a book on her life in Beverly Hills and the dark underbelly that no one ever sees\par \par \uc2 Phillip says: \u8216\'20\'18Poor Scott, he was always one to venture out, try to do things, but he\u8217\'20\'19s past now, he\u8217\'20\'19s paid his price. Who do you blame for his death? His dad. Scott got no love, so he had to fill a void. It\u8217\'20\'19s just so sad.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140520ea5k0076k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 There are many reasons why clusters of innovation and excellence are developing across Europe, writes Sharmila Devi\par \par \uc2 The pace of creativity is far from uniform across Europe. Some areas have developed a reputation for producing and developing exciting business ideas.\par \par \uc2 In cases such as London and bioscience the reasons are easy to understand. The UK capital stands at one corner of a triangle, with Oxford and Cambridge as the other two points, in which the sciences have long attracted some of the best funding and minds in the world. Other cases are less obvious, though, such as the expertise in aerospace engineering in the Czech Republic. During the Soviet years training was excellent, and the current expertise is a direct descendent of that era.\par \par \uc2 In the same field, Wales had the foresight to offer incentives in a new industry with a great deal of potential.\par \par \uc2 London: Bioscience\par \par \uc2 To explain London's lead as a bioscience cluster, Steve Bates, chief executive of the BioIndustry Association (BIA), uses the example of synthetic biology.\par \par \uc2 "Synthetic leather, which has never been near a cow, can be grown from cells. Companies doing this here in London can immediately go and talk to the fashion industry to find business applications," he says. "They're not stuck in some science park but in a global city."\par \par \uc2 The UK has the largest pipeline of any biotech specialist area outside the US, according to a report last year produced by the BIA and financial services consultancy firm EY.\par \par \uc2 The UK biotech sector had more than 400 potential products in the pipeline in 2013 and was the leader in Europe, with Germany and Switzerland filling the next two positions. Globally, California and Massachusetts have the lead.\par \par \uc2 London, together with Oxford and Cambridge, helps southeast England to "punch above its weight", says Bates. World-class universities, a long history of scientific innovation, the \uc2 National Health Service\uc2 , and London's status as a global city in many other sectors from financial services to fashion all combine to attract talent from around the world.\par \par \uc2 In April, Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, launched MedCity, a group of academics and business people who will work to attract more life sciences companies to London, Oxford and Cambridge.\par \par \uc2 Next year, the \u163\'00\'A3500m Francis Crick Institute will open in London for research into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease and to generate new economic opportunities for the UK. Alongside the Crick is Oxford's proposed \u163\'00\'A321m bio-escalator and Cambridge's \u163\'00\'A3212m MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology.\par \par \uc2 There are substantial hurdles to be overcome, though, such as a venture capital sector that is small compared with the US; making sure people can get visas to work in the city; and high prices.\par \par \uc2 And in one way London's success is its enemy, says John Williams, head of clinical activities at the \uc2 Wellcome Trust\uc2 , the leading science and research charity.\par \par \uc2 He says: "Cost-of-living issues pose big barriers to our ability to attract the best young talent."\par \par \uc2 Czech Republic: Aerospace\par \par \uc2 Aerospace has long been a significant part of the Czech industrial mix. Over the past 100 years, including several decades of Communism, it has advanced from lower categories of aerospace production to more sophisticated products such as commercial aircraft and military jets.\par \par \uc2 "In the early 1990s, after the fall of the Iron Curtain, the industry took a significant hit as it had lost essentially all its 'traditional', eastern markets and was not ready to face highly competitive and technologically advanced western markets," says Jan Chmel\u237\'00\'EDk, aerospace manager at business development agency Czech Invest.\par \par \uc2 "However, the Czech Republic was able to build on tradition, technical competence and manufacturing excellence and over the course of 20 years, the aerospace sector is returning to the vanguard of competitive innovation," adds Chmel\u237\'00\'EDk.\par \par \uc2 Most Czech companies are involved in multinational, joint programmes or research projects and co-operate with top corporations such as \uc2 Airbus Group\uc2 , GE Aviation, \uc2 Honeywell\uc2 , Sikorsky and Embraer.\par \par \uc2 "We are proud that we had an opportunity to work with companies such as \uc2 Honeywell\uc2 , which has manufacturing plants as well as a global research and development centre and a business support service centre in the Czech Republic," says Chmel\u237\'00\'EDk.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Honeywell\uc2 's Prague laboratory was the first lab that the corporation established outside the US. GE Aviation produces the new H80 turboprop engine in its Prague facility - the first GE engine that was designed and developed outside the US."\par \par \uc2 Working closely with the aerospace industry to ensure the sector has enough qualified people is a key priority. "Having enough capacity to cope with growing demand and competitiveness is one of the essential issues in the years to come," he says.\par \par \uc2 The main competition is in Asia. "However, we feel that the Czech Republic has an advantage in such a high-tech sector because even though there may be countries with lower labour costs, the innovation and competence is missing," he says.\par \par \uc2 "Rather than see Europe as competition, we prefer to feel European and identify opportunities for Czech aerospace companies to contribute to Airbus's leading position in the global market."\par \par \uc2 Wales: Drones\par \par \uc2 The only airspace in Europe where both military and civilian unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, can be flown alongside normal manned aircraft is in west Wales near the village of Aberporth.\par \par \uc2 West Wales Airport and, since last year, Newquay Cornwall Airport in the UK's West Country together form the National Aeronautical Centre, which has helped to boost investment in drone technology by providing the space for companies to test their products.\par \par \uc2 "We are the gateway to the marketplace. We've done our bit and created the motorway and it's up to the manufacturers to create the cars," says Ray Mann, the entrepreneur who developed the former military airport in Wales.\par \par \uc2 "Civilian unmanned systems as a market is going to be worth $100bn over the next decade or so and we're right at the front edge."\par \par \uc2 He points to potential UAV applications such as flying cargo, search-and-rescue operations, patrolling borders, repairing power lines and even carrying broadband capability as part of disaster support.\par \par \uc2 Companies such as Thales, Selex ES and 3SDL have facilities at ParcAberporth, a Welsh government-owned technology park next to West Wales Airport, where they can test UAVs in 2,000 km over the sea and 500 km over land.\par \par \uc2 It is also the base where the \uc2 UK Ministry of Defence\uc2  is testing the \u163\'00\'A3800m Watchkeeper unmanned aerial system, which has drawn some anti-war and local protestors.\par \par \uc2 The MoD is looking at ways of extending the number of sites within the UK where it could fly drones but for the time being, West Wales and Newquay form a leading, if unusual, cluster for drone-testing technology.\par \par \uc2 Leipzig-Halle: Logistics\par \par \uc2 Since 2005, a number of leading companies have clustered their logistics operations around the Leipzig-Halle airport, including DHL, AeroLogic and Lufthansa Cargo, creating one of Europe's newest hubs.\par \par \uc2 "It was a major decision of DHL to relocate its hub from Brussels," says Uwe Arnold, cluster manager for Netzwerk Logistik Leipzig-Halle, which hosts businesses, academia and local administration.\par \par \uc2 He says the new hub's success is down to three main reasons. First, there is good infrastructure created after the 1990 unification of Germany as well as physical space in the region for companies to expand. Second, it has good proximity to EU markets in central and eastern Europe. Third, the airport is open 24/7 while other cities grapple with residents' objections to expansion because of noise and traffic.\par \par \uc2 "Two major players, Porsche and \uc2 BMW\uc2 , made the decision to concentrate some of their important production facilities in Leipzig," says Arnold. "One of the reasons for this is there is a more skilled workforce compared with Bavaria and southwest Germany. Other companies have followed on this momentum."\par \par \uc2 Competitors for Leipzig to watch include Nuremberg, Hanover, Munich and Berlin. Outside Germany, the traditional hubs in the Benelux countries, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Poland are kept under scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 "The challenge will be to keep the momentum because we've had such high growth," says Arnold. "We're always trying to improve the tech levels inside the cluster with greater investment in infrastructure such as cloud and web applications for logistics."\par \par \uc2 London: Silicon Roundabout and beyond\par \par \uc2 Recent headlines have spoken of a brain drain away from London's Silicon Roundabout, the cluster of tech companies around Old Street, towards Berlin's Silicon Allee because of the expense of living and working in the UK capital and restrictive \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policies.\par \par \uc2 But David Slater, director of international business development at London & Partners, the city's promotional organisation, says London as a whole remains pre-eminent for technology innovation.\par \par \uc2 "Tech is spreading out from Camden to Croydon. If you look at the [recently upgraded] Overground rail line, it provides a map of where there are companies," he says.\par \par \uc2 London's relative strengths remain in place, says Slater.\par \par \uc2 These include access to customers and markets, the business environment including tax and employment laws and policies, and a large and diverse talent pool.\par \par \uc2 "London has 40 ethnic communities each totalling more than 10,000 people. Only New York is comparable in diversity."\par \par \uc2 Slater points to Rekoo, a mobile gaming company and the first mainland Chinese company to announce last year it was moving to London and building a new development team. "Chinese investors tell me they feel welcome in London and they don't feel that in other European cities," says Slater.\par \par \uc2 London has more co-working space, where desks can be rented singly or in groups, than anywhere in Europe except Spain, and the most incubators, he says. He also cites \uc2 Greater London Authority\uc2  figures showing that London has 34,000 tech companies employing around 160,000 employees, which is around 30 per cent higher than five years ago.\par \par \uc2 "We've stepped up our message to the world that London as a whole is Europe's tech capital," Slater says.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140521ea5k00007\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The solutions to Britain\u8217\'20\'19s heated housing market need to be formulated in Downing Street rather than Threadneedle Street\par \par \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  recently urged the Bank of England to use all the tools at its disposal to prevent overheating of the housing market. Yesterday, Mark Carney \u8212\'20\'14 the man the chancellor appointed as the Bank\u8217\'20\'19s governor \u8212\'20\'14 passed responsibility for house price inflation back from Threadneedle Street to Downing Street.\par \par \uc2 Mr Carney could not have been clearer in his remarks to Sky News. Britain\u8217\'20\'19s housing market was, he said, the number one threat to financial stability. While the Bank does have adequate powers to ensure mortgage providers are lending sustainably, Mr Carney identified a lack of new building as the underlying explanation for the 9 per cent increase in house prices that has occurred over the past year.\par \par \uc2 In worrying about the inadequate supply of new housing, Mr Carney was only echoing what this newspaper and market experts have been saying for some time. Such a starkly expressed intervention from the Bank\u8217\'20\'19s governor may be more of a wake-up call for ministers, however. The nation\u8217\'20\'19s housing market is not only a threat to economic stability, as Mr Carney stated. It is also a threat to social justice and personal mobility. Many families are both in debt and inadequately housed while many unemployed people can\u8217\'20\'19t afford to move to parts of the country where there is work. The most prosperous corner of Britain is in danger of becoming the preserve of very high earners, fortunate inheritors and \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  prepared to live in close to Dickensian conditions.\par \par \uc2 Last week there was some good news from the sector. In the past year new housing starts rose to 133,650 \u8212\'20\'14 a 31 per cent increase on the previous 12 months. But it\u8217\'20\'19s not nearly enough. Savills, the real estate company, reports today that population growth has outstripped house building by 19 per cent in the past decade. Britain needs to be building an estimated 230,000 new homes every year simply to keep pace with demand. We need 300,000 newbuilds every year if prices are to begin to return to sensible levels. Mr Carney noted that his native Canada, with half the population of Britain, was building twice as many new homes. Across the Channel, France is also building twice as many new houses. It can be done.\par \par \uc2 With one year until the general election, the housing crisis is set to move to the centre of the political stage and all party manifestos should be judged on their response to this huge challenge. Deregulation of the planning sector is vital and far too many entirely sensible projects are held up by petty nimbyism. Yet addressing this will only deliver some of the new construction that is so vital. Public investment in roads and facilities is also essential to ensure that new developments are not opposed by local communities worried about pressures on schools, hospitals and transport.\par \par \uc2 The coalition\u8217\'20\'19s \u163\'00\'A3200 million commitment to support a 15,000 home development in Ebbsfleet could be a model for much bigger garden city projects in future. Unless the Treasury underwrites the building of affordable homes, the taxpayer will only be forced to pick up the pieces in the years to come. It is not a strategic use of public money for taxpayers to continue to spend approximately 20 times as much on housing benefit as on supporting new construction.\par \par \uc2 More immediately, Mr Osborne would be wise to listen to two of his Conservative predecessors as chancellor, Lords Lawson and Lamont. Both men have suggested that the Help to Buy scheme be reformed. At present the scheme can be used to buy homes up to the value of \u163\'00\'A3600,000. Capping the limit at half that amount would still help people struggling to save for a deposit in most of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s regions. At the same time, a \u163\'00\'A3300,000 cap would stop the injection of even more money into the already hot property markets of London and the southeast.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140518ea5j002ky\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Study of leading economies finds the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  over the past 50 years has been \u8216\'20\'18neutral\u8217\'20\'19 with the amount paid in taxes and received in benefits in balance\par \par \uc2 Mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has brought little or no overall financial benefit to the UK and other countries, a study by the club of the world\u8217\'20\'19s leading economies has concluded.\par \par \uc2 Evidence from around the world over the last 50 years shows that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are not a \u8220\'20\'1Cpanacea\u8221\'20\'1D to boost economic growth but nor are they a \u8220\'20\'1Cmajor burden\u8221\'20\'1D on the taxpayer, new analysis by the \uc2 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\uc2  (\uc2 OECD\uc2 ) finds.\par \par \uc2 Overall, the fiscal impact of migration in \uc2 OECD\uc2  countries has been \u8220\'20\'1Cbroadly neutral\u8221\'20\'1D with taxes paid by new arrivals usually matching what they receive in benefits, it finds.\par \par \uc2 Although in some countries the amount \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  contribute to the public purse exceeds what they receive, new arrivals contribute less overall than the existing population, because many are less well paid.\par \par \uc2 The study is likely to be seized on by both sides in the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate in the run-up to the European elections, with concerns about unchecked \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  dominating the political agenda both in the UK and other countries.\par \par \uc2 It comes in marked contrast to the findings of a report by \uc2 University College London\uc2  last year which concluded that European migrants contributed \u163\'00\'A38.8 billion more to the British taxpayer than they received over a 16-year period.\par \par \uc2 Campaigners for tougher \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  restrictions said it amounted to a \u8220\'20\'1Cnail in the coffin\u8221\'20\'1D of the argument that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  provides a major economic boost to Britain.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMeasuring the impact of migration on the public purse is a complex task,\u8221\'20\'1D the study by Jean-Christophe Dumont, head of the \uc2 OECD\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s International Migration Division, concludes.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNevertheless, over the past 50 years migrants appear to have had a broadly neutral impact in \uc2 OECD\uc2  countries.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn other words, the cost of whatever state benefits they received was largely covered by the taxes they paid.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhere migrants did have a fiscal impact, it rarely exceeded plus or minus 0.5 per cent of GDP.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut while the impact of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  on the public purse is, broadly speaking, neutral, it is less favourable than that of native-born people.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn short, migrants are not a major burden on state spending, but nor are they a panacea for improving public finances.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Sir Andrew Green\uc2 , chairman of the campaign group Migration watch, said: \u8220\'20\'1CGradually the claims for the benefits from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  have been fading and this is another nail in he coffin.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Britain had the third highest number of new arrivals among the world\u8217\'20\'19s leading economies in 2012, after the US and Germany, with 282,600 in 2012.\par \par \uc2 The total was in fact 11 per cent down on that for the previous year but more recent figures from the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  show a further increase in the number of people arriving to settle during the course of 2013.\par \par \uc2 International migrants account for around 12 per cent of the UK population, or 7.8 million people, according to the \uc2 OECD\uc2 . The UK is one of 10 countries, which together are hosting half of all the world\u8217\'20\'19s \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 By far the biggest change was in Germany, which jumped from fifth to second place in the rankings with a startling 72 per cent increase in the number of new permanent migrants in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Within the \uc2 OECD\uc2 , the number of migrants jumped by 35 per cent in the last decade, the study said, while the number of people moving within the EU \u8220\'20\'1Csoared\u8221\'20\'1D in 2012, with 925,000 Europeans moving to another country.\par \par \uc2 Over the past 10 years \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  accounted for 70 per cent of the increase in the European workforce and almost half of that in the US, the report finds.\par \par \uc2 Significantly the UK is close to the top of the world emigration rankings, with 3.5 million Britons living permanently in other \uc2 OECD\uc2  countries, behind only Mexico and China and ahead on India.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140520ea5k006v9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Marion Cotillard says she hopes to get into action films and would like to play a male role\par \par \uc2 Marion Cotillard, the Oscar-winning actress, has revealed she would like to play a man in her next film, saying she has the ability to transform herself from sublime beauty to "quite ugly".\par \par \uc2 Cotillard, who played Edith Piaf in La Vie En Rose, said she was "very able" to change her appearance, but admitted it seemed "totally impossible" to play another sex.\par \par \uc2 She has now claimed she is seeking roles in action films and comedies, and is excited by the thought of being a male lead.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at the Cannes Film Festival, where she is promoting her latest role in Two Days, One Night, she said she did not seek out "ugly" roles deliberately, but would welcome them.\par \par \uc2 When asked whether she would find an up glamorous role more of a challenge, she told a press conference: "I would say that I\u8217\'20\'19m very able to change my appearance. I don\u8217\'20\'19t view myself as someone who is ugly.\par \par \uc2 "I mean, in any event, even a very very beautiful woman sometimes doesn\u8217\'20\'19t view herself as such. It\u8217\'20\'19s a question of self-image.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI know, however, that I can be quite beautiful and I can also be quite ugly. I\u8217\'20\'19m sure I have this ability to transform myself, and that\u8217\'20\'19s quite an asset in the job I do.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 She added the idea of wanting to escape her beauty on screen had "never entered into play".\par \par \uc2 "I\u8217\'20\'19m not going to choose a part where I have no make-up and my hair isn\u8217\'20\'19t done [for the sake of it]," she said. "That's not my plan, to escape the beauty.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut I know I have this...I can physically portray sublime women, for example.\par \par \uc2 "But at the same time \u8211\'20\'13 I\u8217\'20\'19m thinking of Penelope Cruz in Don\u8217\'20\'19t Move \u8211\'20\'13 it\u8217\'20\'19s really hard to make her look ugly. What she does in this film is incredible in terms of female acting, and what she does physically.\par \par \uc2 You don\u8217\'20\'19t recognise her, she looks absolutely hideous."\par \par \uc2 When asked which roles she would now like to be offered, Cotillard, 38, said: "I would love to act in an action or comedy film. These are things I\u8217\'20\'19ve never done. I hope one day I have this experience.\par \par \uc2 "I\u8217\'20\'19m fascinated with the idea of playing a man, because it strikes me as being totally impossible, so that excites me.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The actress, star of Rust and Bone, The \b \uc2 Immigrant\b0 \uc2  and Inception, is now appearing as a depressed woman who has to convince her colleagues to give up their bonuses so she can keep her job.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140520ea5k0060q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

We were expecting speech at 3pm. "Nigel did a bottle job," beams a protestor {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ukipcarnival"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 #ukipcarnival}}}\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile a black Ukip van bearing the slogan \u8220\'20\'1Ctake control of our country\u8221\'20\'1D was parked on the edge of the event, outside the Dorothy Perkins clothes shop in Croydon town centre. At 3.15pm, the van left with no sign of the Ukip leader appearing.\par \par \uc2 According to reports in the Croydon Advertiser, Mr Farage was supposed to speak at the event in the borough where his party is fielding 42 candidates at Thursday\u8217\'20\'19s local elections.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : Michael Deacon - No music, no food, no drink, no dancing - just shouting and placards. To be honest, probably save yourself for Glastonbury {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ukipcarnival"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 #ukipcarnival}}}\par \par \uc2 Winston McKenzie, a black Ukip candidate in Thursday's election, clashed with black teenagers in a debate over whether he was a leader of the community while also being in the party.\par \par \uc2 Mr McKenzie confirmed Mr Farage would not be attending, citing security concerns. He told reporters: "He's a responsible family man and political party leader.\par \par \uc2 "Certain situations you have to avoid."\par \par \uc2 Mr McKenzie added: "Croydon is unsafe and a dump."\par \par \uc2 It comes after Mr Farage was accused of racism for making comments about Romanian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He said in an interview with LBC Radio: "I was asked if a group of Romanian men moved in next to you, would you be concerned? And if you live in London, I think you would be."\par \par \uc2 He said he had been "tired out" during the interview and did not use the "form of words" he would have liked to.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140520ea5k004v4\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Peter Cranie: British politics needs to be about hope - not just fear\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jennifer Williams   \par \uc2 730 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par 18:57\par \uc2 manchestereveningnews.co.uk\par \uc2 MNONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Trinity Mirror   \par \par \uc2 Ukip scaremongering should not be setting the agenda. People need a positive vision for the future, not a negative one\par \par \uc2 With the local and European elections just days away, the campaign is in full swing. Out on the doorsteps of Manchester people are telling us that they're fed up with politics. Politicians don't understand their lives and their concerns. They see them on the telly bickering with each other, trying to score points and bring each other down. They hear a lot about what each party is against. But not much about what they're for.\par \par \uc2 Over in America, Barack Obama won his election with a buzz of political activism and an upbeat message of 'HOPE'. So where is the hope in our elections? This campaign has been dominated by UKIP and their negative politics. We all know that UKIP is against the EU and against \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . They've invested huge amounts of money in billboards to tell us that. But what exactly are they for? They tore up their old manifesto and don't seem to have any policies. Yet they are gathering support by exploiting people's fears.\par \par \uc2 You can understand it. We've been pushed through a punishing six years of spending freezes, then spending cuts. In times of uncertainty people look for simple answers to their worries. Will I keep my job? Will I keep my home? Will I be able to feed my family? People need to know that they can hope for a certain future. They need a confident, bold and positive vision that they can believe in.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this week we launched the North West Green Party's campaign for the local and European elections. Like you, we want a better world for ourselves and for our children. It's outrageous that the 5 richest households in the UK have the same total wealth as the poorest 12 million people in our country. Inequality is not inevitable, but it takes a bold political party to make the case for redistributing wealth. The Greens have been brave enough to take on the political establishment on this. We have backed the Robin Hood Tax that will take a small percentage from the banking industry across Europe, and enable us to redistribute that money back to the people.\par \par \uc2 \u163\'00\'A33.5 billion in profits for the big 5 energy companies while thousands are faced with a choice of \u8220\'20\'1Cheat or eat\u8221\'20\'1D every winter is not inevitable. A scheme implemented by Greens on just one council in Yorkshire now saves households nearly \u163\'00\'A34 million a year off their bills. Our energy priority is to lower our energy consumption to save householders money and to reduce total carbon dioxide emissions. But we are also the party who stands up to the powerful fossil fuel industry and says \u8220\'20\'1Cwe will oppose fracking\u8221\'20\'1D. Unfortunately the parties with red, yellow, blue and purple rosettes all back the frackers.\par \par \uc2 Politics is a serious business. You elect someone and trust them to spend your money and make the best decisions. When the government launched the High Speed 2 rail project the Greens looked carefully at the proposal, the business case and the environmental claims. They just didn\u8217\'20\'19t stack up. We were told that we were wrong. UKIP even went so far as to include three High Speed Rail lines in its 2010 manifesto. Now, as more people are coming out against HS2 and voters realise that it's going to cost every British household \u163\'00\'A31,500, there is a growing realisation that it may do very little to improve travel for the many. The benefits will be limited to business people when what we desperately need is more affordable local transport.\par \par \uc2 What happens at the ballot box later this month is not just about electing councillors and MEPs. It's about sending a strong message to our current government ahead of next summer's general election. If the only story is about UKIP and fear, then that sets the debate and the agenda for the country. The Greens want to change the story. In the last European elections in the North West we were just 0.3% short of gaining an MEP. We think May 22nd really can offer Britain some hope, not just fear. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Document MNONL00020140520ea5k002p9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Voices\par \b \uc2 Does Miliband really want to win the election?\b0\par\par\uc2 Matthew Norman   \par \uc2 1,112 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par 18:48\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 You have to wonder anew whether the politician\u8217\'20\'19s ungodly resilience is a sign of strength, paralysis or delusion\par \par \uc2 For the embattled Ed Miliband, the movie reference of choice has moved on. A couple of years ago, when the perception of\u160\'00\'A0 him as \u8220\'20\'1Cweird\u8221\'20\'1D seemed the major barrier to Downing Street, the template was Roxanne.\par \par \uc2 In that Cyrano de Bergerac reworking, Steve Martin\u8217\'20\'19s outlandishly long-nosed fire chief hides in the bushes and, via a two-way radio, feeds the romantic lines into the earpiece of the pretty but half-witted colleague who serenades Daryl Hannah with them from beneath her bedroom window. If the Labour leader could have found a suitable cipher to schmooze the electorate with his own words, he would have neutralised the adenoidal tones and robotic delivery.\par \par \uc2 You give them sound advice, but will they listen? They will not, and we now find Labour in slow-motion meltdown, releasing monumentally daft party politicals about a shrinking Nick Clegg, and making stupefying errors about which household items are liable for VAT.\par \par \uc2 So it is that the filmic blueprint becomes Tootsie, and specifically the scene in which his agent (Sidney Pollack) tells Dustin Hoffman\u8217\'20\'19s drippy nebbish of a permanently resting actor: \u8220\'20\'1CNo. One. Will. Hire. You.\u8221\'20\'1D This brutal truth is the catalyst for an outraged Michael Dorsey to reinvent himself as Dorothy Michaels, and nab the plum part in the hospital soap.\par \par \uc2 Less because they share an engaging Jewish world-weariness than that no one else has the clout, the Pollack role falls to David Axelrod. During last week\u8217\'20\'19s flying visit to meet the gang, the Obama savant declared that, while everything is going spiffingly, they might think about working on the organisation. With the polls showing the Conservatives nudging ahead and Labour making more unforced errors than Tim Henman in a tight fifth set, that may be translated as: \u8220\'20\'1CWhat the hell have I got myself into here with these rank amateurs?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 To execute his duty as Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s two-minutes-per-day life coach, Axelrod needs to tell him this. \u8220\'20\'1CNo. One. Will. Elect. You.\u8221\'20\'1D If that failed to snap the lad out of his bizarre complacency, nothing could.\par \par \uc2 It would be wrong to overplay the Tootsie cross-dressing analogy by advising Ed to recreate himself as Westminster\u8217\'20\'19s Conchita Wurst in a bid for European glory. It is too late for that. The ballgown would become him, but he cannot grow a beard in time to influence tomorrow\u8217\'20\'19s Euro elections. Besides, for all the amusement value of Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s welding of the BNP\u8217\'20\'19s mores to background scenes from Nurse Ratched\u8217\'20\'19s ward, the Euro elections mean next to nothing in domestic terms. The Ukip victory long since factored into the Tories\u8217\'20\'19 share price will cause them no panic. If Labour won, it would relieve the pressure on Miliband for 3.7 seconds.\par \par \uc2 This week\u8217\'20\'19s most relevant poll will remain the one conducted by ComRes for this newspaper which found that, despite the popularity of his energy bill freeze, Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s leadership makes 6 per cent more likely to vote Labour, and 40 per cent less so. This makes you wonder anew whether the frontline politician\u8217\'20\'19s ungodly resilience is a sign of strength, paralysis or delusion. If everybody incessantly told you or me how unutterably useless we are, we would take the hint and either try to improve or slink away.\par \par \uc2 Yet the younger Milibandroid ploughs serenly on, changing nothing, in the apparent faith that all will somehow be well come next May when the returning officers are handing out the results. It\u8217\'20\'19s true that on \uc2 Betfair\uc2 , Labour is still favoured to win most seats in 2015. The wisdom of the betting crowd cannot be gainsaid, but the odds are shifting and the Conservatives will be favourites soon enough.\par \par \uc2 Having been a rare admirer of Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s temperament, intellect, guts and decency, it is no fun to say this, because none of us likes admitting we were wrong. But the failure to respond adequately, if at all, to the sharply improving economic indicators looks like suicide by stasis. So does his retention of Ed Balls, a shadow chancellor with the economic credibility of the late pools fortune-squanderer Viv Nicholson. So does his refusal to utilise the one genuine megastar available to him, and let Peter Mandelson serenade the electorate on his behalf. That would be an admission that he was wrong about jettisoning every relic of New Labour. And no one, as I may have said, enjoys that.\par \par \uc2 The question Axelrod should be asking Miliband speaks for itself. Do you want to win this election or not? On the abysmal current form, his role model is neither Steve Martin in Roxanne nor Dustin Hoffman\u8217\'20\'19s Tootsie, but an Alec Guinness cameo from an earlier comedy classic. Ed Miliband is Admiral the Lord Horatio D\u8217\'20\'19Ascoyne in Kind Hearts And Coronets, who crashed his ship after stubbornly refusing to change course, and then chose to go down with it, saluting defiantly as the waters closed over him.\par \par \uc2 When all else fails, blame it on the pollen\par \par \uc2 In a joint Radio Times interview with Marion Bartoli \u8211\'20\'13 whose Wimbledon victory last year he sourced, at the time, to the work ethic she derived from not being a long-legged \u8220\'20\'1Clooker\u8221\'20\'1D in the Maria Sharapova mould \u8211\'20\'13 John Inverdale reveals what caused him to make the comment: pollen.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI was feeling so ill that day,\u8221\'20\'1D Inverdale ventures. \u8220\'20\'1CI had terrible hayfever, and all I could think of was that I wanted to go home to bed.\u8221\'20\'1D This will be a relief to anyone mis-led into imagining that the remark was somehow related to his status as a laureate of rugger-bugger sexism.\par \par \uc2 If Ms Bartoli has forgiven him, so must we all. What cannot be excused is the stab at heroic victimhood. As a top-ranked hypochondriac with a sideline in malingering, I loathe a trouper. If you feel lousy (or exhausted, as Nigel Farage alleges he was when drawing his elegant distinction between Romanian and German \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 ), go to bed and trust the world to muck along without you.\par \par \uc2 While accepting Inverdale\u8217\'20\'19s indispensability to those who like their Wimbledon coverage drenched in smugness, sprinkled with narcissism and garnished with clich\u233\'00\'E9, other BBC presenters could have stepped in at short notice. Some might even have had access to antihistamines, and a better than 50-50 chance of marking the hugely intelligent, enchanting and, for what it\u8217\'20\'19s worth, beautiful Bartoli\u8217\'20\'19s triumph without Clarksonian reference to her appearance.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @MatthewJNorman\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140520ea5k003s6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

After a day of criticism, Farage was asked if Ukip were the Millwall FC of British politics. "Perhaps we are the Millwall . . . I think in Westminster we're loathed and feared," he replied.\par \par \uc2 Labour leader Ed Miliband earlier said Farage had made a racial slur but was not racist, but his view was contradicted by Lammy. The MP, whose parents are from Guyana, told the BBC's Daily Politics that Farage's comments reminded him of the racism encountered by his mother and father when they first came to the UK.\par \par \uc2 "What Nigel Farage said over the weekend was racist. So I'm clear, he's a racist," he said. "I am from a background where my parents arrived here as \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . I remember a context in which some people said: 'You don't want these people living next door to you.' That was racist."\par \par \uc2 Cooper, the shadow home secretary, told ITV News: "It's not racist to be worried about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  or to want stronger controls, but it is racist to somehow stir up fears about Romanians living next door. So Ukip should say they were wrong on that."\par \par \uc2 Abbott, a former shadow health minister, said "his remarks were racist" and she was "glad everybody has stopped pussyfooting around".\par \par \uc2 It comes after David Cameron described the comments as "pretty unpleasant" and accused Ukip figures of saying a "succession of pretty appalling things".\par \par \uc2 Farage said in a Guardian interview that British people should be wary of Romanian families moving into their street. He subsequently repeated his position on LBC 97.3 Radio. "I was asked if a group of Romanian men moved in next to you, would you be concerned? And if you lived in London, I think you would be," he told the interviewer, James O'Brien.\par \par \uc2 Farage said last night that he felt "hurt" following criticism of Ukip in recent weeks and that a growing number of people believed that it was a racists' party.\par \par \uc2 Questioned about his recent comments about Romanians, he said on BBC 2's Newsnight: "I have no problem with Romanians; I have a big problem with Romania," saying the country had failed to make the transition to western democracy after communism fell.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Labour MP David Lammy said: "What Nigel Farage said was racist" - a stronger line than that taken by leader Ed Miliband\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140520ea5k00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

Tricky, I think\b0\par\par\uc2 Tim Dowling   \par \uc2 820 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It has been said that a half-hour spent in the company of someone who is good at his job is never wasted, although the person I can find saying it in writing is me. I know I didn't make it up, but I can't remember who did.\par \par \uc2 The Culture Show: \uc2 Lynn Barber\uc2 's Celebrity Masterclass (BBC2) could only be an instructive 30 minutes, especially for someone unable to source a simple quotation. Barber is, according to Alan Yentob's narration, "one of the most admired and feared journalists in the country". Her hatchet jobs have earned her the title "Demon Barber of Fleet Street".\par \par \uc2 She and I have, I think, just one professional assignment in common: we both interviewed Meat Loaf once, back in 2003. A genuine fan, she was shocked to find him dull and grumpy, and was unable to elicit anything of interest from him. I was simply shocked to find the second side of the cassette on which I recorded my interview perfectly blank. It will come as no surprise that her salvage job was a damn sight better than mine.\par \par \uc2 The Meat Loaf case raises an intriguing point. Alan Yentob asked Barber a lot of questions about her interviewing technique (she writes down questions, but doesn't really stick to them; she's "incredibly nosey", and unperturbed by bad behaviour), but technique isn't much use when an interview goes wrong. A subject might walk out halfway through, or might stay and be boring. The real trick of being a celebrity interviewer happens later, when you take whatever scraps you've gathered up and cobble them into something insightful, funny and different, every time.\par \par \uc2 I found myself wondering how \uc2 Lynn Barber\uc2  might find \uc2 Lynn Barber\uc2  as an interviewee. Tricky, I think: her skin seems too thick to get under, and she's too engaging for you to even want to try. She gave the impression of being hard to control - every time Yentob turned his back she nipped out for fag, and he had to conduct a lot of the interview in her front garden - but she was remarkably cooperative when questioned and, as she cheerfully admitted, unembarrassable. Bulletproof, in other words.\par \par \uc2 She learned her trade working for Penthouse magazine (her first interview was with Salvador Dali). Her reputation for savagery is undeserved, she said, because it's only the hatchet jobs that people remember. And anyway, at the time she earned her Demon Barber soubriquet, the most outrageous thing she'd done was ask Jimmy Savile if he liked little girls. "At least I asked," she said.\par \par \uc2 As interviewer-of-interviewer, Yentob ran into difficulty when he met an even more intriguing character halfway through: 91-year-old Edda Tasiemka, who curates an exhaustive celebrity press cuttings library from her house in north London, providing Barber with the bulk of her research material. How do you stop a minor character taking over the story? Or do you just let her? Now that's a question you'd want to ask \uc2 Lynn Barber\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Former BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders was just six when her father, Michael Flanders of Flanders and Swann, died of complications resulting from the polio he contracted in the navy. His death informs her approach to presenting The Battle to Beat Polio (BBC2). She didn't just lose her dad to the disease; she lost him through failings that delayed the development of a vaccine by decades.\par \par \uc2 It's a story of vital decisions affecting public health taken in almost complete scientific ignorance. Treatments for infantile paralysis - such as they were - were sometimes wildly counterproductive: paralysed limbs were splinted and plastered, so the muscles withered even faster.\par \par \uc2 In the early part of the 20th century, researcher Simon Flexner determined that polio was contracted solely though inhalation, and that the virus never entered the bloodstream, making a vaccine useless. He was completely wrong, but terribly influential. He singlehandedly set back vaccine research by 20 years.\par \par \uc2 Outbreaks were blamed on \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . The race to create a vaccine was just that - a race - with the two frontrunners, \uc2 Jonas Salk\uc2  and \uc2 Albert Sabin\uc2 , criticising each other's methods and competing for funds. In the end it was Salk who won, only for Sabin to prevail later: Salk's vaccine was cleared for mass inoculation in 1955, but within a few years Sabin's was the preferred treatment. Looking back, it seems a miracle they came up with a vaccine at all.\par \par \uc2 AND ANOTHER THING:\par \par \uc2 "Every time I think there can't possibly be another thing to do, I think of another thing to do."

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 I don't want to panic you all about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , but I bet there's going to be more and more of it. Fighting it is just Custer's Last Stand. The foreigners will keep coming, and they'll win. And why shouldn't they? They have no choice. What would you do if you were them? Stay at home, starve and die? No. You'd try and get to a safer bit of what's meant to be the global village. A bit like ours - lush, green, full of food (for most people), water, schools, hospitals, and not in a war zone. Sod it if it's a bit crowded, the people hostile and detention centres horrendous. That's nothing on the hell hole you've escaped from.\par \par \uc2 My grandparents did it. If they hadn't come here, they'd have probably been murdered, and now that mass murder and rape, wars, droughts, floods, bombings, famines, slave labour and exploitation, collapsing factories and industrial and environmental catastrophes seem to be on the up, squillions more desperate people are on the move. They want a small share of what we've got.\par \par \uc2 What luck that the poor are often more generous than the very wealthy, because they're the ones who are going to have to do all the sharing. I suspect that the nasty shit-stirrers, such as our current leaders and anti-foreigner upstarts, are doing their best to whip up hatred among the lower orders, so that they'll do the fighting and the dirty work for them, while they retire to their fortresses in Kensington, Brooklyn Heights, Mosman NSW and Ostermalm, and everybody else scrabbles around battling for the few crumbs that are left.\par \par \uc2 "We're all right, Jack," says Fielding ruefully, from his middle-class hidey-hole in Dorset, "but what about the grandchildren?" BBC4 reports that the Institute of Business Ethics would like all companies, including the "biggest multinationals [to] sign up to an agreed set of global ethical standards". Wouldn't that be a lovely start? I try to live in hope. In the meantime, Fielding has taken to standing on the edge of the Jurassic cliffs and screaming at the sea. I may join him. What else can we do?\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140520ea5k0000v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Front: A Europe united by a sullen political disillusionment: As EU voters go to the polls, Ian Traynor in Vienna examines the reasons for a distinct lack of trust in the traditional main parties\b0\par\par\uc2 Ian Traynor   \par \uc2 2,769 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Josef Hoppinger is an increasingly rare type among European voters. He never changes. "I'm a worker. I vote socialist. Always," said the retired plumber, 81. But he thinks the governing Social Democrats of Austria's chancellor, \uc2 Werner Faymann\uc2 , will suffer badly when Europe goes to the ballot box this week. "You've got all these scandals with the banks, all the sleaze and corruption. The big parties will get weaker, not stronger."\par \par \uc2 Hoppinger has lived all his life in the centre of "Red Vienna", a city for ever run by Social Democrats. His home is in Karl Marx-Hof, the expressionist workers' fortress that was Europe's pioneering experiment in social housing in the 1920s and then a battleground in the civil war of 1934, when the left lost to the pre-Hitler Austro-fascists.\par \par \uc2 The complex still houses 5,000 people in 1,400 flats. But it is no longer a vibrant, cohesive community guaranteed to vote for the left. Rather, it is a multi-ethnic mixture of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and poor Viennese, many of them unemployed, making it a fertile hunting ground for the far-right Freedom party of Heinz-Christian Strache: anti-EU, anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , anti-Muslim.\par \par \uc2 "You have areas here that are 70% \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  and 30% Austrian," said Rudolf, 61, declining to give his surname. "I've got nothing against \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , but it's a big problem in Vienna. Strache might not be electable, but he is very strong here. The old parties just don't seem to have the answers any more. They've been there for a very long time but now they are getting more competition. The Social Democrats will lose. Everything is in flux."\par \par \uc2 Not only in Vienna. As the EU braces itself for four days of polling to send 751 MEPs to Strasbourg and Brussels from 28 countries, the temper of the union is one of sullen anger and frustration with a mainstream political class seen as detached and remote, incompetent and venal, and often illegitimate.\par \par \uc2 The results are certain to bring a bonanza for tub-thumping mavericks and radicals on the extreme right and the far left, with the traditional parties of the centre right and centre left haemorrhaging support to the fringes. "We see the risks from these fringe groups being represented in the parliament," said \uc2 Anthony Gardner\uc2 , the US ambassador to the EU.\par \par \uc2 Simon Hix, European politics professor at the London School of Economics, said: "What's happening all across Europe is a decline of mainstream political parties, a fragmentation of the vote on the centre left and the centre right. The social democrats have lost the connection to lower-income voters by not producing jobs and squeezing public spending. There's a failure to generate jobs outside the big urban centres. The decline of manufacturing is replaced by service jobs in capital cities, doing nothing for the white underclass in Salford or Marseille. And the centre right [have] lost the rural conservatives because of their different metropolitan values and the perception they've been captured by big business."\par \par \uc2 The period between this week's vote and the last European election, in 2009, has been the EU's worst ever. The union's crowning achievement, the single currency, almost disappeared under the pressure of a banking and sovereign debt crisis that threatened to tear the EU apart.\par \par \uc2 Five countries - Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Portugal and Ireland - were brought to their knees. Big questions, still unanswered, were raised about France and Italy - the eurozone's second and third economies. German-prescribed austerity and spending cuts were administered on a grand scale. Hundreds of billions were poured into a rotten banking sector whose reckless lending policies did much to create the crisis in the first place. The tensions and resentments brought a resurgence of nationalism in Europe. Youth unemployment soared to more than 25%, to more than 50% in Spain and Greece.\par \par \uc2 If the currency has been saved, the political price has been very high. On the eve of the elections, the EU is staring at years of stagnation and relative decline, increasingly unable to compete globally, to sustain its social and welfare systems, to generate growth and jobs.\par \par \uc2 "Europe is in a mess. Our economies are failing to deliver higher living standards for most people, and many have lost faith in politicians' ability to deliver a brighter future, with support for extremists soaring," wrote Philippe Legrain, a former adviser to the head of the European commission and the author of a recent book on the crisis, last week. "After the longest and deepest recession since the 1930s, the recovery is the flimsiest on record. Much of Europe remains lumbered with broken banks and crushing debts. Most of Europe suffers from record low investment and feeble productivity growth. All of Europe is ageing fast. Depressingly, most Europeans think younger generations will have a worse life than they do."\par \par \uc2 And when things seemed irredeemably bleak, along came Russia's \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 , invading and destabilising Ukraine, unilaterally redrawing the map of Europe on the EU's frontier, and challenging its leaders to stop him.\par \par \uc2 "If you listen to Putin, there's only contempt for Europe," said Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister. "Europe has been living in a postmodern illusion, that everyone wants the same as we do, but just wants to get there at different speeds. That's just not true any more."\par \par \uc2 One of the EU's top diplomats sounds desperate: "We don't have a coherent strategic view and Putin is taking advantage of our shortcomings. What kind of European order do we want? If we cannot give straightforward answers as to what we want to do, you give everything to the populists."\par \par \uc2 In London, Vienna, Berlin, Paris, Brussels and The Hague, the term "populist" is the hold-your-nose form of abuse for the anti-European mavericks and radicals riding high in the polls, beneficiaries of the collapse of public confidence in Europe's political elites - figures such as Nigel Farage in Britain, Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Strache in Austria, all of whom are tipped either to win or come a close second in the elections in their respective countries.\par \par \uc2 "We talk about them but never with them," said Ivan Krastev, a liberal Bulgarian political scientist. "That will be different after these elections. You have a sclerotic political system and a resentment of elites. You have a democracy of mistrust."\par \par \uc2 Besides, European populism is far from a fringe phenomenon. The mainstream centre right, the dominant force in European politics for the past decade, has included Hungary's \uc2 Viktor Orban\uc2 , Italy's \uc2 Silvio Berlusconi\uc2  and France's \uc2 Nicolas Sarkozy\uc2  in recent years, all of them proud populists.\par \par \uc2 Hix argues that Europe's leaders are making a big mistake by ignoring the anti-European insurgents. They are not going away. The new parliament is likely to return three blocs of MEPs, around 150 in total, to the right of the mainstream conservatives. They veer from the Eurosceptical British and Polish conservatives to the outright Europe rejectionists of France's National Front, the Dutch Freedom party and Farage's Ukip.\par \par \uc2 Then there is the often anti-EU hard left, which is likely to do well and supplant the Greens as the fourth biggest bloc in the new parliament. It will do creditably in Germany - where Die Linke is now the main opposition party to \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2 's coalition of Christian and Social Democrats - in France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Czech Republic, and most of all in Greece, where Europe's leftist firebrand, Alexis Tsipras, is tipped to win the election.\par \par \uc2 "It's good for the European parliament that these populists get elected. They represent the real views of Europeans," said Hix. "There is greater competition for low-skilled jobs. It's healthy and legitimate and the mainstream parties are forced to respond. But it's very difficult for the mainstream parties to get it."\par \par \uc2 The conclusion frequently drawn from the rise of the Europhobes is that the EU is in the grip of an anti-Brussels insurgency as the primacy of the nation states of Europe is reaffirmed. But that conclusion is belied by the opinion polls, which show that public confidence has eroded severely in traditional political elites wherever they are found in Europe.\par \par \uc2 A Eurobarometer survey unveiled yesterday found that trust in the EU had fallen steeply to 31% from 57% in 2007. But the same poll found that trust in national parliaments and governments was much lower, at 25% and 23%, and has been consistently lower than faith in the EU for all of the past decade.\par \par \uc2 This may be because, Britain apart, most countries have historically sought salvation in the EU from their own failed political elites and systems. For the Germans the EU brought rehabilitation from the Nazi shame. For the French, Italians and others the EU brought recovery from the trauma of Nazi occupation and collaboration. For Spain, Portugal and Greece the EU secured democracy and helped banish military dictatorships. For the east Europeans, the EU provided an escape channel from the clutches of communism and Soviet control. The hope of securing respite in the EU from corrupt and discredited national elites still obtains in the Balkans and in Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 Britain here is the exception since fighting Hitler was its finest hour and because it has traditionally viewed Europe as a source of trouble rather than trust.\par \par \uc2 But those times may be over. "For many member states, the EU was a scaffolding. But now it's become a cage," said \uc2 Brigid Laffan\uc2 , director of the global governance programme at the \uc2 European University Institute\uc2  in Florence. Sikorski said: "The EU had it easy for many years because we in central Europe were obsessed with rejoining Europe. We've reached the limits of that."\par \par \uc2 EU leaders continue to invoke history to bolster the argument for "more Europe". But in the age of austerity, of slashed budgets, of wrenching reforms, of mass unemployment, recession and stagnation, the arguments have less and less traction if the EU's leaders are not delivering.\par \par \uc2 "The problem is not the Eurosceptics," said Joschka Fischer, the former German foreign minister. "The problem is the mainstream parties. Completely irresponsible. What makes the Eurosceptics so strong? They're strong because they are managing the emotions and we are not. It's hard to counter their arguments."\par \par \uc2 The mainstream counter-arguments are essentially inaudible. Take \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , a sensitive and emotive topic dominating an agenda set by Farage, Le Pen and Wilders.\par \par \uc2 On the centre left and the centre right, an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate is being avoided, leaving the stage to those who shout loudest. Last October, when more than 300 refugees from north Africa drowned off the coast of Lampedusa in Italy, there was an outcry as an EU summit approached. Europe's national leaders opted to shelve the issue. Herman Van Rompuy, the European council president chairing the summit, scratched the topic from the agenda and arranged to have \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  up for debate at a summit at the end of next month. Why? Because, senior officials in Brussels said, EU leaders did not want to trigger arguments about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  before the elections for fear of boosting the anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  campaigners.\par \par \uc2 For the centre right in Britain, Germany and elsewhere, the response to the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  controversy has been to try to appease the far right's supporters by talking about curbs on freedom of movement, clampdowns on alleged benefits tourism, tighter border controls.\par \par \uc2 The centre right or Christian democrats have been the ascendant force in Europe in recent years and are predicted to win the elections very narrowly, but at the price of forfeiting around 60 seats, which would also make them the biggest losers.\par \par \uc2 The mainstream centre left or social democrats have been gaining over the past three years. They now run France, Italy and Denmark and are in coalition in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, and are tipped to win in Sweden in September. But in March, France's ruling Socialists collapsed in local elections while the Dutch Labour party fell to 10%, losing control of its traditional power bases in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, The Hague and Groningen.\par \par \uc2 The fragmentation that is part of the current European political fabric was graphically displayed and could not be ascribed to the Wilders insurgency. Some 30% cast their ballots for new local and regional campaigners, highlighting the failure of the mainstream to maintain its appeal.\par \par \uc2 The centre left has opted to keep generally quiet on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  even though it may be the key to its central dilemma - how to secure welfare systems for its traditional constituencies in a time of low-growth austerity and neo-liberalism.\par \par \uc2 "The traditional parties have no real answers on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ," said Ania Skrzypek, a Polish political scientist who helped draft the European social democrats' election programme. "For us, the main issue is about preserving the European social model. People feel the welfare state is not delivering. In western Europe many think the welfare systems are not sustainable. Migration is the answer. We have some answers, but we don't proclaim them."\par \par \uc2 There is very little evidence in the academic analysis suggesting that migration within the EU has done anything other than bolster the welfare and pension systems of the host countries, with migrants generally contributing more in taxes than they take out in benefits.\par \par \uc2 Rainer Muenz, a leading European demographer, argues that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is essential in a greying Europe, but that Europe's leaders have been asleep at the wheel.\par \par \uc2 The next generation will be 25% smaller than the current one, with huge holes opening up in an EU labour market of 240 million, just under half the population of 505 million. His research concludes that extending retirement ages by a decade will fail to plug the gap and that it is already too late to bring in the numbers of migrants needed in ways that would be politically acceptable. "The options on the table are not attractive for politicians - more migrants, later retirement and unemployment. Plus, a majority of voters will be over 50," he said.\par \par \uc2 Laffan said: "Europe has a huge demographic challenge. It's hard to cope with it politically, but if you analyse it you have to concede that we need inward \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . But too much is done behind a veil. There's a lot of masking of a big part of the system. That degrades European politics."\par \par \uc2 The "masking" extends above all to the handling of the euro emergency and the triumph of technocracy over democracy in four years of crisis management.\par \par \uc2 A senior Spanish politician points out how difficult it was to campaign for office and be taken seriously when budget, spending and fiscal policies were being decided elsewhere by a troika of anonymous men in suits from the European commission, the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  and the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The voters are not stupid. They know you cannot deliver on what you're telling them. They don't believe you. You lose legitimacy," he said.\par \par \uc2 Laffan said: "It's the politics of constrained choice. You need to tell the public that. But the leaders have been in denial. There's a lot of dissembling, politics by stealth. It drains politics of credibility."\par \par \uc2 That's a view commonly held among policy-makers and senior officials in Brussels. "Our government is not credible any more," said an ambassador in Brussels of one member state. "You have to tell people things they don't like. If you don't, you get a populist party. You need to let people benefit from the new Europe and it's not happening."\par \par \uc2 In Karl Marx-Hof, Hoppinger noted that he was born in Vienna the year that the Austro-fascists were shelling the housing complex he has lived in for decades.

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Comment and Debate Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: Nothing will stop Cameron's race to the 'weightless state': In giving up authority over public services, the prime minister is handing them to firms that could become beyond control\b0\par\par\uc2 Polly Toynbee   \par \uc2 978 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 28\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The most terrible power the state can wield is to take children away from their parents for ever. The idea that companies such as \uc2 Serco\uc2  and G4S, already under investigation by the \uc2 Serious Fraud Office\uc2 , should be invited to make a profit from these agonisingly sensitive judgments horrifies the leading experts who wrote to the Guardian last week.\par \par \uc2 In writing commercial contracts there can only be perverse financial incentives either to take more or fewer children into care. Last week I reported on a private equity company promising an 18% return on investment in children's care homes, the sales representative relishing how the "naughtier children pay more". Everything can be monetised, even acute distress. But this one is the ultimate test: if Michael Gove can privatise child protection then anything and everything goes.\par \par \uc2 This government's privatisation revolution is accelerating at breakneck speed. In just the first three months of this year, the value of public-sector outsourcing has shot up by 168%, as monitored by the specialist Arvato's outsourcing index. A quarter of these contracts went to offshore companies - state funds flying abroad, of no benefit to UK employment or tax revenues. From prisons to the \uc2 NHS\uc2 , from the work programme for the unemployed to running military bases, from training RAF pilots to \uc2 Serco\uc2 's management of Yarl's Wood \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  removal centre,"the outsourcing industry is in good health", reports Arvato.\par \par \uc2 From 1 June the probation service will be abolished and parcelled into 21 community rehabilitation companies to be sold off to private businesses, partnered by fig-leaf voluntary groups. But today the parliamentary public accounts committee flashes a red-light warning. Margaret Hodge, the committee's chair, warns that "the scale, complexity and pace of the changes are very challenging" following the "Ministry of Justice's extremely poor track record in contracting out".\par \par \uc2 Backed by the full weight of a government majority on her committee, her excoriation of the plan is formidable. "High-profile failures" of MoJ electronic tagging and court interpreter contracts "give rise to particular concern", Hodge says, noting that there are no contingency plans for failure. The committee says that "this complex, untested" system of payment by results and fee for service needs more transparency to stop "contractors gaming the system, as has happened in the past".\par \par \uc2 The committee expresses profound scepticism that privatisation will yield such savings that within its existing pounds 835m budget, companies will be able to treat an additional 50,000 offenders released from short sentences.\par \par \uc2 The month when a man nicknamed Skullcracker and two other murderers went on the run from prison is a moment to consider that probation is a serious matter. Utility firms cheating their customers is a disgrace, but if commercial probation services cut corners for profit by monitoring offenders less intensively, that would be a public danger.\par \par \uc2 Only ideology drives this privatisation, as the committee points out that all 35 existing probation services to be abolished are rated "good" or "exceptional". If serious crimes committed by offenders while on probation rise, this will be embarrassingly newsworthy. Just consider the multiple privatisation failures so far: Iain Duncan Smith's outsourced Work Programme firms miss their targets by miles, while A4e's contract for mandatory work activity was terminated as "too great a risk". Yet A4e is passed as fit to take on a probation contract - despite having zero experience in the field.\par \par \uc2 Another Work Programme contract crashed last week when Bright International was disqualified for "malpractice". The company, retraining the unemployed for pounds 1.3m, boasted a 100% pass rate but is accused of handing out qualifications to those who failed or never completed courses.\par \par \uc2 But bad contracts for complex services are endemic, and not a Tory preserve. Plenty of privatisations failed under Labour - the worst being \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 's \uc2 London Underground\uc2  debacle. Labour had to abolish individual learning accounts in a hurry when massive scams were found in training companies. Labour's intermediate treatment centres, outsourcing \uc2 NHS\uc2  surgery to private companies, did cut waiting lists, but at hugely inflated cost.\par \par \uc2 The public account committee's report has a weary, seen-it-all-before tone about privatisation failings. Contracts, they say, "have been too large and too complex". Experts in contract writing are being rushed in by the MoJ to negotiate the probation contracts, shoring up a depleted civil service that is usually outsmarted by the private sector.\par \par \uc2 The committee warns that "Large companies such as \uc2 Serco\uc2  and G4S hold major contracts, creating the problem of over-dependency", so a few contractors risk becoming "too big to fail". The ban on \uc2 Serco\uc2  and G4S lasted a very short time, though both are still under investigation. Avarto notes that despite the committee calling for diversity, the dominant position of the "big four" - \uc2 Serco\uc2 , G4S, Capita and Atos - is under no threat. David Cameron says he will "release the grip of state control", but he is replacing the state with a few firms that could become beyond anyone's control.\par \par \uc2 The government is deaf to warnings, as Cameron, Oliver Letwin and Francis Maude's propel their plan for "the weightless state" at breathtaking speed. The scale of this ambition is barely remarked on in the reporting of politics. For now it passes unnoticed by most citizens, few seeing how fast firms like Virgin Care are devouring new contracts.\par \par \uc2 The pace of this outsourcing revolution is set by the fear of being a one-term administration. As Margaret Thatcher sold off the nationalised industries, so her political heirs are intent on leaving an even more radical legacy - selling off the state itself.\par \par \uc2 polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140520ea5k0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

This concept has been explored before in the graphic novel The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, the film adaptation of which remains a case study of cinematic imbecility, but Penny Dreadful is its own bloodthirsty creature.\par \par \uc2 A fin-de-si\u232\'00\'E8cle weirdness inhabits the streets where the supernatural and science brush top hats in dim alleys, which we enter alongside American trick gunslinger Ethan Chandler ( Josh Hartnett) after he's enlisted by Vanessa Ives (Eva "Casino Royale" Green) to aid Sir Malcolm Murray (Timothy Dalton) in the search for his daughter, Mina. Miss Murray, married off by Bram Stoker to Jonathan Harker, may well be instead living the life of a singleton vampire in big whalebone pants.\par \par \uc2 A more enticing mystery than that - yes, even more than whalebone pants \u8212\'20\'14 is who or what spiritualist Vanessa Ives might be. The colour of a consumptive's blush, Green appears to be using telekinesis on the cameras to dominate the screen, a single glance of hers hinting at soul-carving terror. At the start of this fantastical drama Timothy Dalton says, "Do not be amazed at anything you see." Well, sorry, Mr Dalton, but we are.\par \par \uc2 Watch our interviews with the cast on London Go at 6.30pm.\par \par \uc2 Document NS00000020140520ea5k0006w\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 UKIP row over 'foreign invasion' leaflet using graves of Britain's war dead\b0\par\par\uc2 By Dan Kay   \par \uc2 366 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par 15:44\par \uc2 manchestereveningnews.co.uk\par \uc2 MNONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Trinity Mirror   \par \par \uc2 The anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  poster has been called "offensive" and "shameful"\par \par \uc2 UKIP are facing more criticism over a party leaflet which uses the graves of Britain's war dead to attack \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The poster features a picture of crosses on a field in France with the slogan: "They fought and died to keep Britain free from foreign invasion.

chaired by Ukip leader Mr Farage - and to a lesser extent the European Conservatives and Reformists, which includes the UK's Conservative MEPs.\par \par \uc2 The rise of anti-European parties across the continent has been fuelled by both an increase of migration across the EU and the eurozone financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Austerity measures imposed by the troika of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  and \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  has seen a rise in both the far-left and far-right in Greece.\par \par \uc2 Both parties are benefitting from Greek frustration over the strict austerity measures which were conditions of a bailout of the Greece economy in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  parties are thriving in more affluent central and western European countries, such as the UK, France and the Netherlands.\par \par \uc2 Douglas Murray, associate director of the Henry Jackson Society which today published a report on the rise of outsider parties across Europe, said: "This week we will witness an unparalleled surge of parties representing what were, until recently, the fringes of European politics.\par \par \uc2 "These parties are anti-establishment, anti-EU, anti-austerity and in some cases associated with the most extreme forms of politics.\par \par \uc2 "Whatever else happens, this week\u8217\'20\'19s elections look set to alter the balance of power in Europe\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But Professor Hobolt, from the European Institute at the London School of Economics, believes votes for extreme parties -

\par\par \b \uc2 David Cameron: Scotland referendum will be 'irreversible and binding'\b0\par\par\uc2 By Steven Swinford Senior Political Correspondent   \par \uc2 608 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par 14:55\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The Scottish referendum will be 'irreversible and binding', David Cameron says as he suggests Scotland will not get another chance to vote\par \par \uc2 Scotland will not get another chance to become independent if it chooses to remain as part of the United Kingdom, David Cameron has suggested.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Cameron said that the referendum will be "decisive, legal, fair, irreversible and binding".\par \par \uc2 His comments come amid concerns from those campaigning against independence that in the event of a narrow vote against independence the SNP could campaign for a second referendum.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron said: "I think giving them a referendum that is decisive, legal, fair, irreversible and binding \u8211\'20\'13 that is the right thing to do.\par \par \uc2 "Now, obviously it\u8217\'20\'19s a vital debate. I was quite struck when in Scotland last week that every single school that has had a debate on the referendum has voted to stay in the United Kingdom.\par \par \uc2 "My reflection, listening to the debate, is that as soon as you get onto the issues about jobs, about prosperity, about security, people can see the advantages of remaining inside the United Kingdom and let the debate continue.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He said that it was right for Scotland to be able to "choose its future", and that denying the public a referendum would have been "disastrous".\par \par \uc2 He said: "I think trust the people is a very good guide and I think that the Scottish people should be able to decide whether they want to stay in the United Kingdom or whether they want to separate themselves from it.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think this is a deeply Conservative view of life, that in the end you should trust people rather than bureaucracies and institutions to chart the right course."\par \par \uc2 He refused to speculate on what he would say to the Queen if Scotland voted for independence, describing the conversations as "deeply private" and "probably the only private meeting you have all week."\par \par \uc2 He reiterated that he would not resign as Prime Minister if the unionists lost the referendum.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAbsolutely not and I think it\u8217\'20\'19s important know that, because the vote is simply about one thing: does Scotland stay in the United Kingdom, or does it separate itself from the United Kingdom? It\u8217\'20\'19s not about anything else.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He made the comments as \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2 , Scotland's First Minister, said that Mr Cameron had "lost control" of the European debate.\par \par \uc2 Unionists have suggested that an independent Scotland would have to reapply for membership of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr Salmond said: "Although I suspect the PM doesn\u8217\'20\'19t want to withdraw from the EU but he is not really in control of the debate.\par \par \uc2 "So the balance of opinion in Scotland is we should look to further Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s interest within the European context, so it\u8217\'20\'19s not really a worry.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe balance of opinion in Scotland is that we should be an independent member of the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and we don\u8217\'20\'19t have the same agonised debate as is taking place in England where a substantial section of the population are questioning the idea of European membership in total."\par \par \uc2 He also criticised the government's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system, which he said is unnecessarily restrictive. He said: \u8220\'20\'1CWe think it's madness that at the present moment we take a number of international students into Scotland, we spend years raising their human capital and the policy of the current \uc2 UK Government\uc2  is to refuse them the ability to do so; to stop them doing that. We think that\u8217\'20\'19s a foolish policy."\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140520ea5k003jx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

But he said he disagreed with Labour\u8217\'20\'19s proposals to force employers to offer fixed-hours contracts since there are \u8220\'20\'1Ca lot of contexts where zero hours contracts work for the employee and the employer.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhere I think we ought to be going is looking at the right to request a fixed contract, building on the model which we already have for flexible working,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. He added: \u8220\'20\'1CIndeed I am looking at how we can best do that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Cable argued that the financial crisis and recession had exposed significant structural problems in Britain\u8217\'20\'19s labour market. He said the Government had helped produce a \u8220\'20\'1Cstrong and sustain, broad-based recovery\u8221\'20\'1D together with impressive employment levels. But he argued that wages had failed to rise, in part due to \u8220\'20\'1Cquite astonishing increase in labour supply\u8221\'20\'1D, from older workers staying in the market to changes in welfare payments and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140514ea5e004jy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  faces the embarrassment of witnessing the collapse of the right-wing grouping he created in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives could be forced to forge alliances with nationalist parties with hardline views on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  in order to keep the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) coalition alive after this week's elections.\par \par \uc2 Its survival is in the balance as voters prepare to return more MEPs with staunchly Eurosceptic views to the Parliament, paving the way for fresh deals between the right-wing parties that will fill the seats in Brussels and Strasbourg.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron set up the ECR following his promise in the Tory leadership contest to take the Conservatives out of the centre-right European People's Party, whose members include Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.\par \par \uc2 The ECR has 57 members drawn from 11 EU states, although it is dominated by the Conservatives (26), the Czech Civic Democratic Party (nine) and 12 Polish MPs.\par \par \uc2 But polling suggests the alliance could shrink to just 40 members from six countries.\par \par \uc2 That would be a disastrous outcome for Mr Cameron and his allies, as alliances need to contain members from seven states to become an official grouping which receives cash and posts in the Parliament.\par \par \uc2 Under those circumstances, the ECR would then have to recruit allies. That could lead the Prime Minister into some very murky waters.\par \par \uc2 Conservative MEPs have put out feelers to the Finns Party, which has described \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  as "parasites on taxpayers' money" and suggested ethnically Finnish women should have more babies. It is also courting the Danish People's Party, which is strongly critical of Muslim women wearing headscarves in public.\par \par \uc2 An alternative ally could be NVA, a separatist party pressing for Flanders to break from Belgium.\par \par \uc2 Writing on The Independent's website, Gareth Thomas, the shadow Europe Minister, said: "Conservative MEPs are already stranded at the margins of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , but for his MEPs to be even further isolated would undermine \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's ability to negotiate for Britain's interests in Brussels."\par \par \uc2 The dramatic surge of support for the UK Independence Party is echoed by growing popularity across the Union for groups which are instinctively suspicious of Brussels and hostile to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 * Nigel Farage has defended remarks he made about Romanians, saying people would be right to be concerned if a group moved in next door. On four occasions in an interview with the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s political editor, \uc2 Nick Robinson\uc2 , the Ukip leader was offered the opportunity to apologise but refused.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140520ea5k00017\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 'It's the politics of anger' Cameron launches attack on Ukip\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jane Mathews   \par \uc2 600 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par 12:52\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 AS THE European elections loom, David Cameron has urged voters not to be "tempted" to vote Ukip, branding Nigel Farage's recent remarks "appalling".\par \par \uc2 Cameron branded Farage's recent remarks "appalling" [EPA/REUTERS]\par \par \uc2 In his strongest attack on the party yet, the Prime Minister accused Ukip of trying to "frighten" the public.\par \par \uc2 Farage courted controversy last week after suggesting that he would be uncomfortable if a group of Romanians moved in next door to him.\par \par \uc2 He later appeared to backtrack, saying that "the vast majority" of Romanian would make "good neighbours".\par \par \uc2 However, Ukip then went on to claim that Romanian gangs were responsible for seven per cent of crime in the EU - a statistic that Farage admitted in an interview last night was inaccurate.\par \par \uc2 And he courted fresh controversy by suggesting that it was understandable that older candidates should hold homophobic views as they were brought up at a time when they were taught homosexuality was wrong.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to the Daily Mail, Cameron said: "Ukip have condemned themselves during this campaign with a succession of pretty unpleasant remarks. I think the whole country has heard enough to know what sort of party it is.\par \par \uc2 "Some of the messages have been about trying to frighten people. It's the politics of anger.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "We've had financial backers and candidates saying black people should go back to Africa, that it's alright to rape your wife."\par \par \uc2 Farage said he wanted relations between communities to be "better not worse" [GETTY]\par \par \uc2 Cameron said he would not be uncomfortable to have Romanians as neighbours, adding: "What was wrong with that remark is it just branded all people the same because they come from one country. It was an appalling thing to say."\par \par \uc2 He was also asked why his pledge to hold an in/out referendum on the UK's EU membership by 2017 had not won voters from Ukip.\par \par \uc2 He said: "I think in many ways the referendum pledge will have its greatest relevance at the time of the next election when people will be choosing, do you want to have the Conservatives, David Cameron, continuing with a long-term economic plan that's turning the country around and an in/out referendum?\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "Do you want those things or do you want Labour - that will tax, spend and borrow - or do you want to vote for another party that could risk not having a long-term economic plan and a referendum?"\par \par \uc2 Ukip are widely expected to win the European elections, which take place on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 On Newsnight yesterday, Farage said: "Uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has bred a new form of racism.\par \par \uc2 "All over the country I talk to people who say, 'I hate to say this, I've never felt like this, but I am beginning to feel a degree of enmity towards communities I am living with such is the pace of change'.\par \par \uc2 "If we have Romanians coming to Britain, on work permits with the necessary checks, then no one would feel if a group of Romanian men moved in next door that there would be a problem.\par \par \uc2 "So relations between communities would be better not worse."\par \par \uc2 He also accepted there were homophobes in his ranks, but added: "Can you name me a party that hasn't, particularly over the age of 70?\par \par \uc2 "This generation were taught to believe this was wrong and I think many people of that age still find it difficult."\par \par \uc2 His comments come after a Ukip candidate posted a message on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  suggesting that "poofters" should be "shot".\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140520ea5k00105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Tim Montgomerie\par \b \uc2 The first of Thatcher\u8217\'20\'19s children has arrived\b0\par\par\uc2 Tim Montgomerie   \par \uc2 1,012 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par 11:31\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Maria Miller\u8217\'20\'19s resignation will soon be forgotten. But her replacement could make a lasting impression on politics\par \par \uc2 An MP could be found in a bed in a compromising situation with a dead human or a live animal and the public would be interested and appalled, but not surprised. That was the colourful but depressing verdict of Iain Duncan Smith when I once asked if a now forgotten indiscretion by an MP would have any impact on the opinion polls. Politics had fallen to such a low level of esteem that voters expected their elected representatives to misbehave and misbehave badly.\par \par \uc2 Political parties are now judged on whether they could keep waiting lists and taxes down \u8212\'20\'14 on basic competence rather than the basic instincts of their representatives.\par \par \uc2 For individual MPs, however, this cynical mood means they get little benefit of the doubt when allegations are made against them. We learnt that 80 per cent of the public thought Maria Miller should resign, even though very few probably studied the complexity of her circumstances. She was hardly blameless, of course. She did make an error with her claims. She could have been more co-operative with the inquiry. And her 32-second apology to the Commons was inadequate. Overall, however, there was a sense that she was guilty because most politicians are guilty.\par \par \uc2 Despite Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s efforts at Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s Questions yesterday the fallout of Mariagate will be limited. \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  will be frustrated that the only mother in his cabinet was ousted and even more annoyed at losing a trial of strength with the press. There may be a short-term boost to Nigel Farage and his charge that the \u8220\'20\'1CLibLabCon\u8221\'20\'1D establishment needs replacing. It will be short-term because Ukip does not come out well when its own MEPs\u8217\'20\'19 expenses are examined. It will be short-term because voters do not think that members of any one party possess a monopoly either of virtue or sin. I don\u8217\'20\'19t expect the Miller affair to influence more than a handful of voters at the next election. It will be the bread-and-butter issues of living standards and public services that will decide who governs Britain. It nearly always is.\par \par \uc2 Unless yesterday\u8217\'20\'19s resignation leads to a cleaner, less bureaucratic system of parliamentary allowances \u8212\'20\'14 which it should \u8212\'20\'14 it is unlikely to be remembered for Mrs Miller\u8217\'20\'19s demise. However, it might well be remembered for Sajid Javid\u8217\'20\'19s rise.\par \par \uc2 Somewhat prematurely but with some good reason, the new Culture Secretary is already being tipped as a future Tory leader. His biography is certainly impressive. He\u8217\'20\'19s Muslim by background and a second-generation \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 . His father arrived in Britain from Pakistan with nothing. He won the nickname \u8220\'20\'1CMr Night and Day\u8221\'20\'1D for the number of shifts he would work to provide a better life for his five sons. Mr Javid inherited his father\u8217\'20\'19s work ethic and patriotism. He has lived the British Dream \u8212\'20\'14 marrying his Christian wife Laura and succeeding handsomely in banking before he entered parliament in 2010 \u8212\'20\'14 although being an ex-banker may not endear him to many.\par \par \uc2 I should declare my own interest. I\u8217\'20\'19ve known Sajid for 25 years. I can even remember when he had hair. I\u8217\'20\'19ve forgotten how many Star Trek movies we\u8217\'20\'19ve watched together, although mentioning that might not endear him to the artistic elites who will be wondering about their new minister\u8217\'20\'19s cultural hinterland.\par \par \uc2 We were in the Exeter University Conservative Association at the end of the 1980s. I remember him going to Tory conference to protest at the Thatcher government\u8217\'20\'19s decision to join the ERM. He handed out leaflets describing the decision as a fatal economic mistake. He was more Thatcherite than Margaret Thatcher and the Black Wednesday experience vindicated his judgment.\par \par \uc2 State-educated and brought up in Bristol on what was once described as \u8220\'20\'1CBritain\u8217\'20\'19s most dangerous street\u8221\'20\'1D, he has always put his family first. He was once asked if he was wise to put his children into private schools, given his political ambitions. He said he didn\u8217\'20\'19t care if it caused him difficulties. His father gave him everything he had and he would give his own four children everything he had, regardless of what opponents might say.\par \par \uc2 If he can survive the trial by trivia that faces every Culture Minister \u8212\'20\'14 What was the last play you saw? Who is your favourite contemporary British artist? Which team holds the FA Cup? \u8212\'20\'14 he is likely to use his new portfolio to uphold press freedom, protect commercial media organisations from BBC expansionism and champion private investment in the arts.\par \par \uc2 Yet he is also interesting for at least two other reasons. He\u8217\'20\'19s the first of the huge intake of 2010 Tory MPs to get to the cabinet. In terms of ethnicity, gender and schooling it was the most diverse parliamentary cohort in Conservative history. Mr Cameron will hope that the days of promoting women and minorities to positions of influence before they were ready are over. Hopefully, promotions will now be on merit rather than for presentational reasons.\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid is also one of the first children of Thatcher to get to the top table in government. We know that he shares her commitment to market economics, choice in public services and the nation state. Do he and others from the 2010 intake also understand Thatcherism\u8217\'20\'19s weaknesses? Will they worry as much about protecting the safety net for the victims of the economic cycle as she worried about creating ladders of opportunity for its beneficiaries? And will they be able to compromise with political opponents in a way that she struggled to do?\par \par \uc2 Sajid Javid has risen quickly and may rise much farther still, but he also risks seeming too partisan on occasions and too ready to confront, rather than persuade, doubters. His and his party\u8217\'20\'19s success depends upon learning from the Iron Lady\u8217\'20\'19s weaknesses as well as her strengths.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140520ea5k00108\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Tim Montgomerie\par \b \uc2 Ukip voters aren\u8217\'20\'19t racist. They\u8217\'20\'19re in despair\b0\par\par\uc2 Tim Montgomerie   \par \uc2 948 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par 11:29\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The way to stop the rise of Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party is to start understanding its voters rather than hurling insults at them\par \par \uc2 Ukip can\u8217\'20\'19t be surprised. If you style yourself as an anti-establishment party you can\u8217\'20\'19t expect the establishment not to fight back. But what a fightback! It has had all the subtlety and sophistication of the Ukip oiks of the establishment\u8217\'20\'19s caricature.\par \par \uc2 The crude attacks on Ukip echo those made by \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  eight years ago. The Tory leader dismissed Ukip as a party of \u8220\'20\'1Cfruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\u8221\'20\'1D. \uc2 Ken Clarke\uc2  dismissed Ukippers as clowns. \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is full of such insults. You\u8217\'20\'19re racists! Homophobes! And, suggesting that many people have learnt little from Gordon Brown\u8217\'20\'19s infamous encounter with Gillian Duffy \u8212\'20\'14 bigots! But Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party can\u8217\'20\'19t be so easily dismissed. Two new opinion polls suggest they might score 36 per cent or even 38 per cent in this month\u8217\'20\'19s European elections.\par \par \uc2 Ukip represents something more enduring than an explosion of hate. If it is to be defeated it would be wise to investigate why so many voters are turning to it. There will be no cure without correct diagnosis. And lest readers be in any doubt, I want there to be a cure.\par \par \uc2 Ukip is not a grown-up party. There are huge contradictions in its spend-more, tax-less policy agenda. There\u8217\'20\'19s Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s own addiction to the EU gravy train. Ukip MEPs\u8217\'20\'19 failure to turn up to crucial votes in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  when UK interests are at stake. The very real nastiness of some of their activists \u8212\'20\'14 and their nativism. But if patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel, shouting \u8220\'20\'1Cbigot\u8221\'20\'1D has too often become the first resort of modern-day liberals when they are challenged by people they don\u8217\'20\'19t understand.\par \par \uc2 If we do want to understand the Ukip phenomenon we should identify the errors being made by politicians and journalists that are helping to keep Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s face on what seems like every TV broadcast. I suggest eight explanations:\par \par \uc2 Anger at globalisation The changing nature of the world economy meant wages for many low-skilled people were depressed even before the crash. Anger at this could have been a huge opportunity for Ed Miliband but his permissive attitude to welfare and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has alienated many heartland Labour voters and given Nigel Farage his opportunity. According to the academics Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford, the profile of Ukip voters is the most working-class of all of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s main parties. It\u8217\'20\'19s why Mr Farage was so anti-big business in his recent debates with Nick Clegg.\par \par \uc2 Large-scale \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  Net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  may be down but many Britons still see \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  into their communities taking place at near-record levels. They connect this phenomenon to their low wages and inflated housing costs. Much more than Europe, this is the policy issue that drives Ukip. Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s voters note Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s promise to control \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and they note it is not even close to being met.\par \par \uc2 Broken promises Not controlling \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is not the only broken promise. Labour didn\u8217\'20\'19t deliver an EU referendum in the previous parliament. Nick Clegg has dumped his tuition fees pledge. Compromises are necessary in real-world politics but what voters like least about politicians is broken promises. Unfortunately, the horse-trading you get in coalition governments only makes them more likely.\par \par \uc2 Protest voting The Lib Dems would be surging today if they hadn\u8217\'20\'19t entered government, but Ukip is now the protest vehicle of choice. Episodes such as those involving Patrick Mercer and Maria Miller fuel one of the defining features of Ukip voters: boiling anger at rich politicians perceived to be on the make.\par \par \uc2 The emergence of a political class Ukip talks about a \u8220\'20\'1CLibLabCon\u8221\'20\'1D where the big party leaders share similar beliefs, are inauthentic because they\u8217\'20\'19re poll-driven and lack experience outside politics. The truth is that there\u8217\'20\'19s a widening divide between Labour and the Tories. The choice at the next election will be bigger than for many years.\par \par \uc2 An illiberal liberalism Even most ethnic minority Britons want less \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Many of the most decent, community-orientated Christians oppose gay marriage. But liberalism has become illiberal. Many remember that draft Clegg speech in which opponents of gay marriage were labelled as \u8220\'20\'1Cbigots\u8221\'20\'1D. It is now \u8220\'20\'1Cliberals\u8221\'20\'1D who need to condemn a little less and understand a little more.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s misdiagnosis of the Tory problem Ukip became a right-wing phenomenon when Mr Cameron was making a point of not \u8220\'20\'1Cbanging on\u8221\'20\'1D about Europe and other core Tory issues when he first became party leader. In fact voters generally liked right-wing Toryism but they wanted right-wingery with compassion for the low-paid; a Toryism that did not leave people alone in tough times. Mr Cameron got closest to the correct prescription with his commitment to the \uc2 NHS\uc2 . That\u8217\'20\'19s why Andrew Lansley\u8217\'20\'19s unheralded \uc2 NHS\uc2  reorganisation was such a gift to his opponents.\par \par \uc2 Pundits who hate \u8220\'20\'1Cthe right\u8221\'20\'1D Some pundits who complain about Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s hatefulness are actually pretty hateful towards Ukip, but they kid themselves if they think a Tory majority is possible without catering to right-wing perspectives. Margaret Thatcher worked very hard to ensure that voters with right-wing views on issues such as crime voted Tory.\par \par \uc2 As much as some would wish otherwise, you can\u8217\'20\'19t abolish Ukip-minded voters \u8212\'20\'14 you eventually force them out of the mainstream and into inventing their own party. And they have.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140520ea5k00105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

It\u8217\'20\'19s the whites who need the help\b0\par\par\uc2 David Aaronovitch   \par \uc2 1,141 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par 11:22\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \b \uc2 Immigrant\b0 \uc2  groups in Britain are generally better motivated than indigenous people, who often just can\u8217\'20\'19t keep up\par \par \uc2 When I started secondary school in the mid-Sixties, by the measures then used, unemployment was effectively zero and had been since the end of the war. The older brothers of most of the boys around me at Holloway County were rolling out of class at 15 or 16, often with few or no qualifications and into a job of some kind. Despite sometimes heroic efforts on the part of the teachers, the prevailing attitudes of the pupils towards being educated remained indifference, good-natured bemusement or sometimes straightforward hostility. They really didn\u8217\'20\'19t need no education.\par \par \uc2 Spool on a few years and I was in Rotherhithe, a mostly working-class area still. It was Tony Blair\u8217\'20\'19s first term and his education secretary, David Blunkett, had brought in a new act establishing city academies, which, you may recall, were to be different from \u8220\'20\'1Cbog standard comprehensives\u8221\'20\'1D. A friend, a local school governor, was telling me that there had been a rush of inquiries from parents about the academy that was to be set up locally. But most of these parents were black Africans, first generation \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , looking to secure a better education for their kids. The white working-class parents, she said, were conspicuous by their absence.\par \par \uc2 By then, unemployment, though far lower than in the trough of the mid-Eighties, was three times higher than it had been when I tripped through the gates of Holloway. Low-skill jobs were disappearing. There was a much greater need to leave school with some qualifications.\par \par \uc2 That same year girls outperformed boys in getting As at A level for the first time. And David Blunkett worried about a \u8220\'20\'1Claddish anti-learning culture\u8221\'20\'1D that was leading to chronic underachievement.\par \par \uc2 Gradually, over time, the worry has morphed from being about boys to being about poor white boys. Whites (not just poor ones and not just boys) are less likely to go into higher education than any of the ethnic minorities, and far less likely than some of them.\par \par \uc2 It is too early to know what the outcome will be for the largely white \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from the EU, but the evidence seems to suggest that their children perform well at school. Indeed, a recent paper by the \uc2 Economic and Social Research Council\uc2 , which started off looking at possible problems in educating Polish and other children, ended up worrying that these pupils were not being sufficiently challenged academically.\par \par \uc2 It is unsurprising, then, that the terms of the popular debate about \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  has altered fundamentally since I was young. The model of migrant miscreance is now not the smelly, feckless, uneducated, crime-prone chancer but the hard-working, job and school-place snatching overachiever. The problem with migrants is not their inability, but their ability relative to some of the indigenous population.\par \par \uc2 There are exceptions, of course, but I would put it to readers that a rational people would now turn this national discussion on its head. Such a people would recognise that we don\u8217\'20\'19t have an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  problem. The \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are mostly doing everything we could want them to, in schools, colleges, workplaces and businesses.\par \par \uc2 Their success is fuelling a backlash. In their excellent book Revolt on the Right, the academics Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin analyse support for Ukip. They demonstrate that it is \u8220\'20\'1Canchored in a clear social base: older, blue-collar voters, citizens with few qualifications, whites and men\u8221\'20\'1D. These are people, they write, \u8220\'20\'1Cwith obsolete skills and few formal qualifications (who) have struggled in a post-industrial economy\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Now look at the county of Lincolnshire. Last May Ukip became the opposition on the county council, winning 16 seats. The 2011 census confirmed that Lincolnshire has a significantly higher proportion than the national average of residents with no or low qualifications. The county is older and more unhealthy than the nation as a whole.\par \par \uc2 Last May Ukip won five out of seven seats in the Lincolnshire town of Boston, polling between 35 and 45 per cent of the vote. Boston has the lowest level of educational attainment in Lincolnshire, already an underperforming county.\par \par \uc2 A statistical analysis of children on free school meals, based on 2009 figures, showed that those in Lincolnshire had almost the worst life chances in the country, while those from Newham, in London \u8212\'20\'14 the most ethnically diverse borough in the country \u8212\'20\'14 had the best chance.\par \par \uc2 Why? Part of the explanation is obvious. \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  tend to be more motivated than most people, have often already overcome major barriers to get here, are younger and so on. But why do poorer indigenous people often seem so unmotivated?\par \par \uc2 The answer is not, by the way, the loss of grammar schools. Though Ukip is strongly in favour of a return to the 11-plus system, claiming that it aids social mobility, the educational situation in Lincolnshire should give them pause. There, a selective system means that 25 per cent of the children do indeed attend grammar schools (and therefore 75 per cent don\u8217\'20\'19t). The results for those who do are good and for those who don\u8217\'20\'19t, as we have seen, are pretty poor. It is an irony that the educationally deprived of Lincolnshire should vote for a party that would continue their deprivation. But then, such ironies are legion in 2014.\par \par \uc2 To reiterate, we don\u8217\'20\'19t have an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  problem. We have instead a problem with and for those fellow citizens who can\u8217\'20\'19t keep up and that is where we ought to concentrate our attention. If we were to set up the equalities and human rights commission anew, this would be the first task it should be given. Don\u8217\'20\'19t worry about the Bangladeshis, we\u8217\'20\'19d say, they\u8217\'20\'19re OK. So are the Indians. And the Africans. Even the girls.\par \par \uc2 But how do we prepare the least educated and the harder to reach for the world as it is? All our sensible politicians know this is the real question. Iain Duncan Smith knows it, Yvette Cooper knows it, David Laws knows it. They may yodel the anti-migration message, but their minds aren\u8217\'20\'19t in it, let alone their hearts.\par \par \uc2 Somehow we have to bust through the lack-of-aspiration barrier, break-up the anti-education ethos, help instil in indigenous Brits what \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  already seem to possess. The desire to go forward. The need to progress.\par \par \uc2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\par \par \uc2 This article has been chosen as today\u8217\'20\'19s Talking Point by The Times community team for the quality of the comments left by readers.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 If Thomas Piketty thinks that today\u8217\'20\'19s capitalism has failed, he needs to explain what he is going to replace it with\par \par \uc2 In 1973 Joseph-D\u233\'00\'E9sir\u233\'00\'E9 Mobutu had an idea. As part of his drive to be seen as the intellectual leader of Africa, a role for which he was spectacularly unsuited, he would embark on a vast economic experiment. Zaireanisation.\par \par \uc2 What had once been the Congo Free State was pursuing what Mobutu termed a policy of \u8220\'20\'1Cauthenticity\u8221\'20\'1D, and Zaireanisation would be its economic counterpart. It involved nationalising foreign-owned assets \u8212\'20\'14 farms, plantations, commercial enterprises, the entire industrial sector.\par \par \uc2 Mobutu was a bit hazy on detail and his favourite subjects at school had always been demagoguery and rhetoric rather then economics. So the rules governing who got the assets and who managed the industries were vague to the point of non-existence.\par \par \uc2 The result was disaster. Zaire became a kleptocracy with, as Michela Wrong records in her brilliant history of the president\u8217\'20\'19s regime, Mobutu as the king thief. A new social class \u8212\'20\'14 the Big Vegetables \u8212\'20\'14 was born, handing out assets to themselves and their relatives. Prices rose, businesses shut, jobs disappeared, growth came to an end and imports of Mercedes-Benz cars hit an African record.\par \par \uc2 By the time that even Mobutu realised his error, it was too late. He called for foreign investors to come back to Zaire, but who would want to do that?\par \par \uc2 Let me explain why I am bringing this up. Over the past month the French economist Thomas Piketty has been on a world tour supporting his new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the title a deliberate echo of Marx. He has been advancing the idea that capitalism will produce an increasingly unequal society. And his reception has been rapturous.\par \par \uc2 The enthusiasm for his book has mainly come from the left. Not, however, exclusively. There is general agreement that he has produced interesting data that, at the very least, poses a troubling question: if returns on capital grow faster than the economy, as Piketty suggests has happened at most points in capitalism\u8217\'20\'19s history, might we be heading towards a grossly unequal society based on inherited wealth?\par \par \uc2 The Frenchman says that we have only enjoyed a brief holiday from this tendency because of progressive policy and because two world wars destroyed great fortunes. We are now heading back to the past.\par \par \uc2 His data and his writing have won him positive reviews. However, even the commentators most convinced by this account of the future finish with what they see as a small admission, one the author makes too. Piketty\u8217\'20\'19s solution to the problem he predicts \u8212\'20\'14 a global wealth tax and 80 per cent top income tax rate \u8212\'20\'14 is not very \u8220\'20\'1Crealistic\u8221\'20\'1D. Which I think means, \u8220\'20\'1Cis one of Baldrick\u8217\'20\'19s cunning plans\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Yet this admission is not, not remotely, a small one. It is not just an afterthought in a critique of capitalism that the author can\u8217\'20\'19t think of a better idea. It is not a side point that in the 150 years or so since Marx\u8217\'20\'19s Capital, every single attempt at an alternative to capitalism has been a growth-destroying, liberty-crushing, dictator-producing, starvation-creating, murderous disaster.\par \par \uc2 Stupid though it was, Mobutu\u8217\'20\'19s Zaireanisation wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t win the international socialist stupidity competition. I am pretty sure Mao\u8217\'20\'19s Great Leap Forward, in which peasants melted down their cooking pots to make steel and then died of hunger, would edge him. And the Kims in North Korea would be justifiably miffed if their effort didn\u8217\'20\'19t at least net them a \u8220\'20\'1Chighly commended\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 When I was an undergraduate debating for hours in Florries, the LSE student union coffee shop, I used to think that one day I would grow up and work out how the great utopian schemes of my left-wing fellow students would actually work. During the Occupy demonstration outside St Paul\u8217\'20\'19s in 2012 I finally realised that I was doomed to die not knowing.\par \par \uc2 The proposals that Piketty makes may not be on the epic scale of Mobutu, but they are not obviously more practical. Or desirable. I have a friend who always makes the point that all politics is autobiography, so perhaps I might explain my argument using a little family history.\par \par \uc2 I come from exactly the sort of family that Piketty writes about. The sort whose inherited fortune was destroyed by the war. My grandfather was a wealthy man. He and his brother had built a major industrial iron business, employed many people and owned factories and workshops. Stalin took it all, sent him to Starobelsk labour camp and my father and grandmother to the borders of Siberia. By the time the family arrived in London they were on national assistance.\par \par \uc2 I hope I can be excused for not seeing this as an entirely good thing. In other words, the destruction of inheritance by the war might conceivably play a benign role in a book on inequality (the social evil that Piketty entirely aims at), but it would certainly play a malign one in a book on liberty.\par \par \uc2 In any case, as it happens there was no increase in equality. My grandfather\u8217\'20\'19s property wasn\u8217\'20\'19t enjoyed by the people. The Soviets and the Nazis tried running the factory before closing it down; the wealth was destroyed not redistributed.\par \par \uc2 And the family home? It became a holiday apartment for communist leaders in Ukraine. The bitter truth of most schemes for redistributing large chunks of wealth is that, rather than being spread, it is held by the state and enhances the power, wealth and status of the Big Vegetables.\par \par \uc2 Piketty, I am sure, doesn\u8217\'20\'19t see his policy as one of confiscation. Yet my grandfather\u8217\'20\'19s property had to be removed at the point of a gun. His imprisonment was a necessary part of the deal. He wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t have carried on doing business in Ukraine if he knew it would be taken from him. Who is going to build a fortune that they will not be permitted to enjoy and that will not be allowed to pass to their children?\par \par \uc2 There is one more relevant piece of family history. My father did not inherit the factory and its responsibilities. He came here penniless. But he did inherit from both his parents a belief in the power of knowledge and he had an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s work ethic. He rebuilt in this country.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Piketty\u8217\'20\'19s work has many assumptions and a good deal of heroic extrapolation. It is a hypothesis. Against this is the certainty that in a free enterprise system, education for all and hard work promises prosperity and liberty under law.\par \par \uc2 A more modest claim than the great dreams of the anti-capitalists, but less likely to yield to the tyranny of the Big Vegetables.\par \par \uc2 daniel.finkelstein@thetimes.co.uk\par \par \uc2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\par \par \uc2 This article has been chosen as today\u8217\'20\'19s Talking Point by The Times community team for the quality of the comments left by readers.

\par\par \uc2 Rachel Sylvester\par \b \uc2 Stop faffing about. We need a radical rescue\b0\par\par\uc2 Rachel Sylvester   \par \uc2 1,152 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par 11:12\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Caution is the watchword at Westminster, but a Lib Dem ex-minister has risked alienating his party with a bold vision\par \par \uc2 These are big times and yet our politics seem so small. The challenges faced by the country after the economic crash are enormous, but minor solutions are proposed. The urgency of the change in the balance of global power caused by the rise of China is met with dither and delay in government. The multidimensional cultural revolution brought about by the internet, advances in genetic science and the rise of individualism is handled with moral equivocation at Westminster.\par \par \uc2 Politicians pander and prevaricate, hedge and haver when radicalism is needed, not reassurance. They get bogged down in rows over expenses and insult each other in the Commons rather than setting out positive ideas. People want honesty and authenticity, but party leaders are so nervous of offending grassroots supporters that they struggle to give voters the clarity they crave. There is an emphasis on tactics rather than strategy as ministers try to control the headlines for a day, rather than manage the country for a decade. It is no coincidence that all the parties are riven by disagreements about whether to be bold or cautious between now and the next general election. Angst is the political currency of the age.\par \par \uc2 This is an argument tackled head on by Jeremy Browne, the former Liberal Democrat minister, in a book, Race Plan, published today. The MP for Taunton, a surprise victim of the last reshuffle, criticises the coalition for a woeful lack of ambition which, he argues, puts both economic recovery and national stability at risk. \u8220\'20\'1CWe cannot afford the political procrastination that is too often our default mode when faced with big decisions,\u8221\'20\'1D he writes, in a deliberate swipe at the Government of which he was a member. \u8220\'20\'1CCaution and conservatism are, paradoxically, the greatest danger. We either embrace innovative change or live with the consequences of our inertia.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Having travelled the world during his time at the Foreign Office and seen the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  when at the Home Office, he argues that doing nothing is not an option if Britain is to survive in an interdependent world. In what he calls the Asian century, the global order is being turned on its head with astonishing speed, yet in this country the Government is dragging its feet when radical reform is needed.\par \par \uc2 While ministers faff around about whether to construct a third runway at Heathrow, China will build 82 whole new airports between 2011 and 2015. MPs agonise about the environmental impact of the HS2 rail link between London and Birmingham \u8212\'20\'14 the Chinese laid 10,000km of high-speed lines between 1990 and 2011 and are still whacking them down in the largest infrastructure project in history.\par \par \uc2 Twenty five years ago, China had 147km of motorway. By 2007 it had increased this to 35,000 and by 2011 it had created 85,000km of fast roads. In 1990 China\u8217\'20\'19s GDP was $357 billion: it is now $8.23 trillion, roughly 23 times bigger. Over the same period, life expectancy rose from 69 to 76 years and the number of Chinese who travelled to a foreign country increased from 980,000 to 80 million. There is a \u8220\'20\'1Cdangerous complacency\u8221\'20\'1D in Britain and a worrying lack of political urgency about the need to reassess existing assumptions, Mr Browne concludes. \u8220\'20\'1CJust as the alternative to being old is not being young but being dead, the alternative to embracing the future is not living comfortably in the past but failing in the future.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The solution proposed by this former minister is an \u8220\'20\'1Cauthentic and unadulterated\u8221\'20\'1D liberalism of a sort he clearly feels is no longer on offer from his party under Nick Clegg. He calls for the reduction of the top rate of income tax to 40p \u8212\'20\'14 criticising the Government for \u8220\'20\'1Cuneasily\u8221\'20\'1D splitting the difference at 45p. The top rate should have been lowered, he argues, only when the personal allowance was raised to \u163\'00\'A310,000, to demonstrate commitment to those at the bottom as well as at the top.\par \par \uc2 The same free-market liberal approach must also be extended to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and public service reform. On education, Mr Browne wants the introduction of vouchers and a vast extension of free schools, with profit-making organisations allowed to set them up. On health, he argues for more patient choice and the creation of new sources of revenue, including insurance payments. The \uc2 NHS\uc2  is, he writes, unsustainable in its current form and there should be a \u8220\'20\'1Crestless and innovative search for improvement\u8221\'20\'1D in patient care. The ring-fencing of the health and international aid budgets should also scrapped.\par \par \uc2 He proposes a new hub airport in Kent with at least four runways, but preferably six, and a second runway at Gatwick as an interim measure. There should be an acceleration of HS2 and a great expansion of housebuilding, including on green- field sites, he adds. What is more, the Department for the Environment and Climate Change should be scrapped and the House of Lords reformed or even abolished to create a political system for the 21st century. Whitehall must lose the mentality of \u8220\'20\'1CI spend, therefore I care\u8221\'20\'1D, because outcomes, not input, matter in an increasingly competitive world. Such views would not be surprising from a Thatcherite Conservative, but they are fascinating from a Liberal Democrat.\par \par \uc2 This manifesto will not endear Mr Browne to his party \u8212\'20\'14 which he once compared to a supermarket trolley that always veers to the left \u8212\'20\'14 but his economic liberalism is matched by a social liberalism and a positive attitude to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and the EU that would alienate traditional Tories. He criticises the \u8220\'20\'1Cnostalgic nationalism\u8221\'20\'1D of the Right as well as the \u8220\'20\'1Cromantic social democracy\u8221\'20\'1D of the Left, arguing that the only solution for Britain is liberalism \u8220\'20\'1Cwith the handbrake released\u8221\'20\'1D rather than the faltering version on display from the coalition. Rather than being left- or right-wing, it is, he believes, a world view that might be shared by \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 , without the conservatism of \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  or Tony Blair, without the statism of \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 . It would probably be supported by Boris Johnson \u8212\'20\'14 and by Mr Clegg before he decided to position his party as the moderating influence on the Conservatives and Labour, rather than as a liberal force in its own right.\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband is at his best when at his boldest \u8212\'20\'14 but he is clearly on the left, with his energy price freeze, bank bonus tax and talk of rail renationalisation. Mr Cameron is veering to the right on Europe, welfare and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to head off the Ukip threat. There is certainly a space to be filled in what Roy Jenkins called the \u8220\'20\'1Cradical centre\u8221\'20\'1D of politics. Most importantly, though, this is a time for action, not angst.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140520ea5k000um\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Unless they persuade Britain\u8217\'20\'19s ethnic minorities to support them at the polls, the Conservatives face annihilation\par \par \uc2 Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, Catch a spider by the toe. There\u8217\'20\'19s no N-word in the version of the playground rhyme that children use now. Jeremy Clarkson may not have been racist in his mutterings for Top Gear but he was certainly out of date. Some senior Conservatives fear their party is just as out of touch with the modern, ethnically diverse world.\par \par \uc2 A report published today by Policy Exchange, the centre-right think-tank, should make sobering reading for \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 . This Portrait of Modern Britain concludes that ethnic minorities will make up between 20 and 30 per cent of the UK population by 2051. While the number of white people has remained roughly the same over the past decade, the number of blacks and Asians has doubled.\par \par \uc2 Eight million people \u8212\'20\'14 14 per cent of the population \u8212\'20\'14 now belong to an ethnic minority. Although these groups make up only 5 per cent of those over 60, they represent 25 per cent of children under five. In the UK\u8217\'20\'19s largest cities ethnic minorities already represent 40 per cent of the population and in London, non-whites outnumber whites at every age up to 20. Britain is changing fast and it is a trend that is only going to accelerate.\par \par \uc2 Despite all Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s sound and fury about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , for most people this is something to be celebrated rather than feared. Where I live in Hackney we benefit hugely from the mish-mash of Turkish corner shops, Indian takeaways, Vietnamese dumpling stores, French delis and micro-breweries making hipster beers.\par \par \uc2 This seems to be a general feeling among those who actually experience the melting pot. According to Policy Exchange, 90 per cent of both white and minority residents feel that their local area is a place where people from different backgrounds get on well together. Interestingly, ethnic minorities are three times more likely than whites to feel that \u8220\'20\'1Cbeing British\u8221\'20\'1D forms some part of their identity. These communities are, for the most part, keen to integrate and aspire to succeed \u8212\'20\'14 all minority groups have higher proportions of students staying on in formal education at 16 and 18 than the white population.\par \par \uc2 For the Conservatives, though, the changing face of Britain poses a threat not only to their electoral success but to their very existence. The think-tank makes the point that ethnic minority communities \u8212\'20\'14 often treated, patronisingly, as a single political entity \u8212\'20\'14 are in fact several distinct groups with different priorities and expectations. Although 40 per cent of black people live in social housing, for example, 65 per cent of Indians and Pakistanis live in owned accommodation. There are also discrepancies in education, with 75 per cent of Indian pupils achieving five A-C grades at GCSE compared with 50 per cent of black Caribbean students and 62 per cent of Bangladeshis.\par \par \uc2 What unites all these groups, however, is a deep and enduring suspicion of the Tories. At the last general election, almost 70 per cent of ethnic minority voters backed Labour. Although 37 per cent of the white population voted Conservative, only 16 per cent of black or Asian people did. There is some evidence that opposition is softening among Indians \u8212\'20\'14 who are now four times more likely to identify with the Tories than black Africans \u8212\'20\'14 but still only 24 per cent of Indian voters ticked the Conservative box in 2010. Put bluntly, the single biggest predictor for not voting Tory is not being white.\par \par \uc2 This is the case, regardless of class, wealth or policy views. Although wealthier white voters are more likely to support the Conservatives, there is no similar gap between different socio-economic groups for non-white voters. Black and Asian voters, asked to place themselves on a spectrum for two issues \u8212\'20\'14 tax and spend, and liberal or authoritarian \u8212\'20\'14 all put themselves closer to the Tory position, but still described themselves as Labour.\par \par \uc2 With hazy memories of Enoch Powell\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Crivers of blood\u8221\'20\'1D speech and Norman Tebbit\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Ccricket test\u8221\'20\'1D handed down the generations, ethnic minorities dislike the Conservatives because they are the Conservatives not because they disagree with particular policies. They are unlikely to give the party any credit for the recovery \u8212\'20\'14 according to Policy Exchange polling, these voters feel better off, and believe the economy is turning around \u8212\'20\'14 but all groups except Indians think that Labour would be better at running the country\u8217\'20\'19s finances.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThese are distinct communities but the common trait is they all hate Tories,\u8221\'20\'1D according to one senior figure. \u8220\'20\'1CThey don\u8217\'20\'19t think the Conservatives care about or understand them.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 With just a year to go before the next general election, Mr Cameron faces a dilemma. In nearly half of the 80 Tory target seats, the black and Asian vote is larger than the Labour or Lib Dem majority that the Conservatives need to overturn. There is a huge electoral prize to be won if ethnic minority voters can be persuaded to trust the Tory party, but it will be hard to deal with decades of antagonism in just 12 months. Lynton Crosby, the Tories\u8217\'20\'19 director of strategy, wants a relentless focus on the economy and issues such as \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and welfare between now and polling day. For him, an ethnic minority outreach strategy would be a distraction. He cares only about victory in 2015. George Osborne is similarly focused on the immediate electoral test.\par \par \uc2 Other senior Conservatives, including Michael Gove, the education secretary, and Sajid Javid, the culture secretary, are more worried about the long-term survival of their party. For them there is more at stake than the result of next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election. If almost a third of the electorate will soon be made up of people who are instinctively hostile to the Tories, the Conservatives face annihilation, not just defeat.\par \par \uc2 The modernisers, including Mr Gove, have been speaking to Jason Kenney, the Canadian minister for citizenship, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and multiculturalism, who transformed the Conservative party\u8217\'20\'19s fortunes in his country by building bridges with ethnic minorities. Described as \u8220\'20\'1Cthe smiling Buddha\u8221\'20\'1D, he argues that \u8220\'20\'1Cnew Canadians\u8221\'20\'1D are \u8220\'20\'1Cthe personification of Margaret Thatcher\u8217\'20\'19s aspirational class\u8221\'20\'1D. Between 2004 and 2011 he increased his party\u8217\'20\'19s standing among these voters from 21 to 31 per cent. Next month he is coming to London to advise the Tories on how they can do the same. Mr Cameron should make the time to meet him and revive his campaign to eliminate the ethnicity effect in British politics.\par \par \uc2 The Conservative leader has a responsibility to think about the long-term future of his party, as well as its short-term fate at the general election \u8212\'20\'14 on which his own survival depends.\par \par \uc2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\par \par \uc2 This article has been chosen as today\u8217\'20\'19s Talking Point by The Times community team for the quality of the comments left by readers.

All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A REAL-LIFE Shirley Valentine is demanding a move back to Britain with her Tunisian toy boy - as they are broke. But Deborah Chniti's plan has been scuppered after husband Ala was denied a visa as the couple do not have enough money. Grandmother-of-four Mrs Chniti, 43, met her 27-yearold husband on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and moved to Africa in 2012. She believed she could return with Ala within four years but new rules have killed off the couple's hopes. Mrs Chniti, who lived on benefits in Britain, has been told they must have \u163\'00\'A362,500 in savings if Ala is to be granted a visa. But he earns just \u163\'00\'A35 a day as a labourer. Mrs Chniti, originally of Stoke, said: It's disgusting. The government just wants my money and is letting all the wrong \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  in.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'We welcome those who wish to make a life in Britain but it must not be at the taxpayers' expense.'\par \par \uc2 Document METRO00020140520ea5k0002q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw138\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2070\pichgoal600

He wasn't arrested and he's not heard from the police.' The latest scandal in Retford, Nottinghamshire, came a day after Nigel Farage's deputy told protesters to 'f*** off' during a leafleting drive.\par \par \uc2 Janice Atkinson, who is also Ukip's press adviser, is accused of insulting a rival about her weight, then 'flipping the bird' at her.\par \par \uc2 Maria Pizzey, who was allegedly targeted by the party official, said: 'This is the most aggressive individual I have had the misfortune to come across.' Meanwhile, leading Labour figures have said Mr Farage is racist. Tottenham MP David Lammy accused Mr Farage of being 'deeply nasty'.\par \par \uc2 But yesterday, Mr Farage replied: 'Our \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy, far from being racist, aims to end discrimination against non-Europeans.'\par \par \uc2 Document METRO00020140520ea5k0000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The Kids Are All Right director will adapt Christos Tsiolkas' novel The Slap for US network NBC, after it became one of the most-discussed books of recent years\par \par \uc2 Lisa Cholodenko, director of The Kids Are All Right, is to direct the opening episodes of The Slap, a TV adaptation of the controversial novel by Christos Tsiolkas to air on US network NBC.\par \par \uc2 The 2008 novel became a reading group staple thanks to its fractious story of a father who slaps another family's misbehaving three-year-old son at a barbecue, setting off tensions and anger throughout the families present and bringing bigotry to the surface. It became an international bestseller, was longlisted for the Booker prize, and has already had one TV adaptation in its native Australia. While it garnered some excellent reviews, other critics were vocal in their opposition: India Knight called it "unbelievably misogynistic" with a "ludicrous, comedy-macho sensibility."\par \par \uc2 Tsiolkas wrote in the Guardian: "I wanted to write about complacency, the fact that Australia at the turn of the century had become one of the wealthiest and most prosperous nations on the planet... The great waves of post-first world war \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , the impact of feminism, the assertion of Aboriginal sovereignty; all these were a challenge to the masculine myth of mateship that was such a strong part of the culture... How were we to make sense of these contradictions? What did it say about us as a people, as a nation, as a culture?"\par \par \uc2 This is ideal ground for Cholodenko, whose films explore the tensions, hypocrisies and foibles of liberal middle-class life \u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0The Kids Are All Right concerned the children of a lesbian couple reconnecting with their biological father, and the emotional mess he ends up creating, while her calling card High Art looked at a lesbian romance fraught with thwarted ambition.\par \par \uc2 She is also gearing up to direct another book-to-TV adaptation, Olive Kitteridge, starring Frances McDormand and Richard Jenkins, and set to appear on HBO. Tom Hanks is to executive produce the show, which will be a four-hour miniseries based on the 'novel in stories' by Elizabeth Strout. The novel is a set of 13 interrelated short stories set in a working-class coastal town in Maine full of betrayal and romance, linked by the titular character, a stormy yet empathetic maths teacher.

\par\par \b \uc2 Leader : Ukip language causes alarm as polling day nears\b0\par\par\uc2 Leader   \par \uc2 813 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par \uc2 The Scotsman\par \uc2 SC\par \uc2 1\par 24\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014   \par \par \uc2 Sometimes it is hard to know whether some of Ukip's candidates in the European parliamentary elections have genuinely distasteful views or are just plain daft. According to David Coburn, Ukip's lead candidate in Scotland, \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  was guilty of a "sectarian" stunt for visiting a mosque on the election trail.\par \par \uc2 Eh? By any standard of logic, even a warped one, the comment doesn't make any sense. To be sectarian, one would, at the very least, refuse to visit places of worship associated with one particular faith while happily visiting others. Mr Salmond can be accused of many things, but that is certainly not one of them. Indeed, in this case, as Scotland's First Minister, he was surely trying his utmost to be non-sectarian.\par \par \uc2 In an attempt to explain himself, Mr Coburn said that if he had visited a Roman Catholic cathedral, he would have been accused of playing the religious card. Eh, again? We are completely unable to imagine any connection between Roman Catholics and Ukip's principal policies of being anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  or being against British membership of the EU.\par \par \uc2 Some, we concede, may think there is a sinister link between the EU's founding Treaty of Rome and the fact that the RC Church has its seat of temporal governance in Rome. But such people, we also reckon, are given to wearing tinfoil hats.\par \par \uc2 So it is tempting to dismiss Mr Coburn's remarks as mere nuttiness. But it is becoming more obvious by the day that there are just too many outbursts by too many Ukip people for the party to be regarded as just harbouring a few cranks, like any political outfit. The candidate who said that comedian Lenny Henry should go back to a "black country", the Scottish official who said that \uc2 Glasgow City Council\uc2  was for "lesbians, gays [and] communists", the councillor who blamed flooding on gay marriage ... the list goes on and on.\par \par \uc2 True, some of these people have been kicked out of Ukip. But there's the leader himself, Nigel Farage, on the radio and saying some pretty unpleasant things about Romanians, as though to be Romanian is to be a criminal. And when asked to apologise for this absurd stereotyping, he refuses to do so on air, and only does so many hours later.\par \par \uc2 One straw in the wind does not make a solid case for there being a nearby haystack, but when it becomes a blizzard of straws, it is fair to assume that the haystack is near and in a state of collapse. But Ukip, quite extraordinarily, despite all the evidence that it harbours rather a lot of intolerant and racist people, is not at all about to fold in on itself.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, it is not impossible that by next week Mr Coburn will be an MEP representing Scotland. Voters will have the democratic choice of accepting or rejecting such opinions at the ballot box on Thursday. Mr Coburn could do himself and his party a favour by withdrawing his remark in advance of the election.\par \par \uc2 Needless delay - now get on with it\par \par \uc2 WHY has it taken three years for a learned committee to conclude that the radiation particles which have long been known to exist on the beach at Dalgety Bay in Fife pose a risk to public health and that action to clean it up should be taken as soon as possible?\par \par \uc2 It is not as though Dalgety Bay is remote and rarely visited. It is right next to a township of several thousand people and hundreds of children, whose parents constantly worry that they are at risk. Children being children, temptations to ignore instructions and go play on the beach will always exist. That radioactive particles coming off Second World War aircraft instruments dumped offshore were being washed onshore has long been known.\par \par \uc2 The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment believes that these are unconnected with cancer rates in nearby communities. But it believes they are a risk to health. It surely cannot have taken three years to reach that conclusion - testing a sample of the particles, which are described as "high activity", ought to have produced the necessary evidence a lot quicker than that.\par \par \uc2 The committee says that it has not been able to determine the magnitude of the contamination or how long the natural decay of radioactive elements might take for the danger to disappear of its own accord. But the suggestion that an offshore barrier should be constructed implies that it thinks the risk may be pretty substantial.\par \par \uc2 At least the clean-up is now demanded. It will be difficult, laborious and costly. But what the people of Dalgety Bay do not need is any dispute between the Scottish and UK governments over who should pay for it.\par \par \uc2 Document SC00000020140520ea5k0000q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw59\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Ukip candidate in scuffle with disabled protester\b0\par\par\uc2 Laura Pitel   \par \uc2 544 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2014\par \uc2 The Times\par \uc2 T\par \uc2 2; National\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The man vying to become Ukip's first MP was accused of scuffling with a disabled protester yesterday as tensions grew over the party's alleged racism.\par \par \uc2 Roger Helmer, an MEP who will fight the parliamentary by-election in Newark next month, tried to take a megaphone from David Challinor, a miner who lost the use of one arm in an industrial accident.\par \par \uc2 Mr Challinor claimed that one of Mr Helmer's aides "lunged" at him after he approached the MEP outside a caf\u233\'00\'E9 in Retford, Nottinghamshire, with a group of demonstrators. "They were shouting 'get that megaphone!' and then this youth jumped up and lunged at me, trying to pull it," he told the Retford Times. "He was trying to take it from my right arm, which I've had five operations on and can't straighten."\par \par \uc2 Mr Helmer denied that he or his staff had assaulted Mr Challinor, a Labour district councillor, but said that he had tried to take the megaphone to respond to allegations about his expense claims in the European parliament.\par \par \uc2 John Mann, the local Labour MP, said that Mr Challinor made a statement to the police about the incident. Mr Helmer said that any attempt to take the matter to the police would be "vexatious". He added: "I am certainly not apologising to him. They should be apologising to us for harassment and deliberately provocative behaviour."\par \par \uc2 The row came as Nigel Farage was forced to back down further over remarks about Romanians, while a string of senior Labour figures broke cover to brand him a racist. The Ukip leader said that he was sorry if he "gave the impression" during an interview last week that he was discriminating against those from the eastern European nation.\par \par \uc2 He said that he regretted using the words "you know what the difference is" when asked to explain the difference between Romanians and Germans, though he insisted that there was a "real problem" with organised crime among some Romanians in London that had been "brushed under the carpet".\par \par \uc2 Accusations of racism continued to dog the party as the founder of Ukip, the academic Alan Sked, revived claims that Mr Farage described black voters as "the n***** vote" in a private exchange in 1997. Ukip dismissed the claim by Mr Sked, who left the party almost 20 years ago, as "absurd".\par \par \uc2 Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, defied her party leader by describing Mr Farage's remarks about Romanians as racist. Ms Cooper, who is tipped as a future Labour leader, told ITV: "It's not racist to be worried about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  or to want stronger controls, but it is racist to somehow stir up fears about Romanians living next door." ? Senior Lib Dems are trying to claim credit for exposing the "nasty views" held by Nigel Farage and Ukip. Mr Clegg said that his decision to take on Mr Farage in two live TV debates had led to scrutiny exposing Ukip's questionable views on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , gay marriage and women in the workplace. "The mask is slipping for Nigel Farage and he is demonstrating or showing quite a nasty side to both him and his party," said a source close to Mr Clegg.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140520ea5k000bg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 David Cameron has spoken passionately about his desire for Scotland to remain in the UK, insisting that "we would be deeply diminished without Scotland". Now that sentiment is to take on a personal hue for the prime minister and his wife Samantha, who have hired a Scottish nanny to take care of their three children.\par \par \uc2 The helper has been hired to replace Gita Lima, the family's long-serving Nepalese nanny, who will shortly go on maternity leave.\par \par \uc2 The new nanny, whose name is not known, was shown the ropes yesterday by Ms Lima, joining her on the children's school run.\par \par \uc2 As well as strengthening the bond between London and Edinburgh, the appointment of a British nanny will also avoid awkward questions about the rights and wrongs of hiring foreign workers at a time when \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is a central electoral issue.\par \par \uc2 Downing Street was forced to defend the couple's decision to hire Ms Lima this year after a home office minister criticised a "wealthy metropolitan elite" who used migrants to provide "cheap labour".\par \par \uc2 The couple have previously demonstrated an unusual taste in au pairs. When Ms Lima took a break in 2012 they hired a smoking, drinking Australian backpacker to fill in.\par \par \uc2 Sammi Strange, then 24, got the job after a series of interviews with the Camerons conducted over Skype. In an online survey on a social networking site, she admitted shoplifting, smoking and drinking, but denied taking drugs "in the past month".\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140520ea5k000b7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

It said: "We see no reason why, with the help of EU membership and the right economic policies Scotland could not attract sufficient labour to fuel healthy economic growth rates."\par \par \uc2 Labour's shadow pensions minister Gregg McClymont, below, said: "\uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  must come clean on how much extra \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  would be needed to pay for pensions in a separate Scotland." SNP Veterans minister Keith Brown said: "Our controlled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system will ensure those given entry are here for right reasons."\par \par \uc2 chris.musson@thesun.co.uk The Sun Says \u8212\'20\'14 Page Eight\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140520ea5k000ft\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSE prices could go on rising for four more years without causing concern, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  suggested yesterday.\par \par \uc2 Speaking after the Bank of England raised the prospect of intervention to cool the property market, the Prime Minister urged people to be "careful" over talk of a housing bubble.\par \par \uc2 Surveys suggest that house prices in Britain are rising by more than 10 per cent a year, and by more than 40 per cent a year in parts of London.\par \par \uc2 Some economists fear buyers could be taking on unsustainable levels of debt.\par \par \uc2 Mark Carney, the Bank governor, said on Sunday the housing market posed the "biggest risk" to the economic recovery. He suggested he could intervene to stop banks lending large mortgages.\par \par \uc2 But in a BBC interview yesterday, Mr Cameron appeared to downplay concerns about the property market. He insisted that allowing for inflation, houses were still cheaper than seven years ago.\par \par \uc2 "We have to be careful when we look at the figures," he said. "We are still seeing house prices in real terms that are 15 per cent off the peak they reached in 2007.\par \par \uc2 "The most recent forecast I saw was that house prices in real terms would not achieve their previous level until 2017/2018."\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron also defended the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which gives guarantees for people taking out mortgages of up to \u163\'00\'A3600,000.\par \par \uc2 Liberal Democrat ministers including Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, have suggested the scheme is helping to inflate the housing market.\par \par \uc2 However, Mr Cameron said the scheme was delivering positive results. "Help to Buy was not a return to irresponsible lending practices," he said. "I think [Help to Buy] has made a difference."\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron was speaking on an election campaign tour in Essex, where the Conservatives are facing a challenge from the UK Independence Party for the support of working\u8211\'20\'13class voters.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister used the visit to accuse Nigel Farage of trying to "frighten" voters about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Mr Farage said last week people felt uncomfortable about living next to Romanian migrants.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron said: "Farage has said pretty appalling things and he has not had to very publicly eat his words. Some of the messages they have been making are about trying to frighten people."\par \par \uc2 Remove only the lies from internet, says Cameron\par \par \uc2 People should not be allowed to erase information about themselves from the internet if it is factually correct, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  has said.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister was reacting to a European court ruling last week that there should be a "right to be forgotten" on the internet. It compels \uc2 Google\uc2  and other search engines to remove the links to information, rather than the information itself.\par \par \uc2 Since it was introduced, more than 1,000 people have asked \uc2 Google\uc2  to remove links to unfavourable reports. They included a former MP seeking re\u8211\'20\'13election, a man convicted of possessing child abuse images and 20 convicted criminals.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister's official said yesterday that Mr Cameron felt that a distinction had to be drawn between truth and falsehoods on the internet.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140520ea5k0009c\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par
