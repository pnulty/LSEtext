It said organised criminals and terrorists use the aviation sector for crimes ranging from illegal \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , importing hard drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines, and trafficking firearms.\par \par \uc2 The NCA is asking farmers and airstrip operators to look out for planes that are "covered in mud" when only Tarmac strips are listed on their flight plans. Aircraft that stay "very briefly" at foreign destinations should also be reported, it said.\par \par \uc2 Planes that regularly suffer minor damage, and those modified to increase range or load, should also be monitored, it added.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140506ea560002z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business\par \b \uc2 House prices are as big a challenge as inflation in the Seventies and Eighties\b0\par\par\uc2 Jeremy Warner   \par \uc2 1,295 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph\par \uc2 DT\par \uc2 1; National\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Viewpoint\par \par \uc2 Oh for a world of stable or falling house prices. Outside estate agents, property developers, second\u8211\'20\'13home owners and buy\u8211\'20\'13to\u8211\'20\'13let landlords, it is hard to find anyone who unambiguously welcomes double\u8211\'20\'13digit house\u8211\'20\'13price inflation, the return of which was confirmed last week by the latest Nationwide survey.\par \par \uc2 If it makes you feel a bit wealthier, good for you, but it's largely illusion, for only by cashing in and moving somewhere cheaper will you enjoy any tangible difference to spending power.\par \par \uc2 Otherwise, it brings only the pervasive grind of ever higher levels of debt to pay for the next step up on the housing ladder, and the troublesome worry about the welfare of one's children, and how on earth they are ever going to be able to afford a roof over their heads. Politicians may be making a mistake if they think stoking house prices is the way to electoral victory.\par \par \uc2 With the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 's Financial Policy Committee belatedly showing signs of alarm over the latest boom, what can or, more particularly, should be done about it? Before answering this, let's first ponder why house prices are rising so fast and dispel one or two myths about the nature of the UK housing market. The causes are easily distilled down to just two \u8211\'20\'13 low interest rates and shortage of supply.\par \par \uc2 Neither of these are tackled by Ed Miliband's naively inappropriate proposals for rent controls, as indeed is the case with all the other ideas he has put forward for market intervention to ease the cost of living.\par \par \uc2 These only target the symptoms, and by doing so, tend to make the underlying causes even worse. There is nothing more guaranteed to create a shortage than attempting to control prices. To see this principle at its most extreme, go to Venezuela where price controls are de rigueur. If official prices ruled, things might not be so bad, but of course they don't. To get the products at all, you have to pay way over the odds.\par \par \uc2 Besides, today's housing "crisis" is largely one of the last government's own making. To run an open doors \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy while failing to solve supply in the housing market was bound to create trouble. It ill becomes Mr Miliband and much of his shadow cabinet to complain. They could have done something about it, but didn't.\par \par \uc2 In any case, the best and most obvious solution to house price inflation is to improve supply, as urged by the likes of Simon, Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next. The Government has chipped away at planning reform, leading to a significant rise in planned housebuilding. Slowly but surely, it is becoming easier to build. Even so, the reforms so far do no more than scratch the surface. What's needed is something very much more radical.\par \par \uc2 As Lord Wolfson points out, it is a myth that Britain is already an overdeveloped country; giving over just an extra 1pc of all land to development \u8211\'20\'13 raising its coverage from 8pc to 9pc \u8211\'20\'13 would release 808 square miles for housing and nonagricultural endeavour, more than enough to cure the housing shortage once and for all.\par \par \uc2 Yet we have to be politically realistic about this. Planning reform is a protracted and difficult process, involving a myriad local sensitivities which cannot lightly be trampled on. Any big bang approach to housing supply is extremely unlikely, whichever political party is in power.\par \par \uc2 Policy is therefore left unduly reliant on demand\u8211\'20\'13side solutions, which is always going to be problematic when attempting to maximize economic growth. Crack down on demand for housing, and inevitably you will end up restricting growth.\par \par \uc2 If one of the myths about UK housing is that we have run out of space, the other is that the UK housing market was the major cause of the banking crisis. It was not. Indeed, throughout the crisis, UK mortgage lending remained strikingly immune to default.\par \par \uc2 This might not have been the case were it not for record low interest rates, but then an awful lot of things would have looked much worse but for rock bottom rates. Whatever; the fact is that UK banks lost far more on overseas mortgage lending, particularly American, than they ever did on home loans back here.\par \par \uc2 Historically, UK mortgages have proved an extremely low risk form of lending, which is why banks tend to be so keen on them. Even \uc2 Northern Rock\uc2 , which engaged more enthusiastically than most in higher risk mortgage lending and used a very unsafe business model to sustain it, will not overall lose money once runoff has been completed. Small wonder that much of the increase in UK credit over recent decades \u8211\'20\'13 indeed, on some accounts the overwhelming bulk of it \u8211\'20\'13 has been focused on the housing market.\par \par \uc2 But although excessive UK mortgage lending may not of itself have been a cause of the banking crisis, it does seem to pose a threat to wider macroeconomic stability. What the crisis demonstrated was that countries with very high levels of household indebtedness tend to be particularly vulnerable to any collapse in economic confidence. High debt may explain why Britain had a much deeper recession than, say, France.\par \par \uc2 It also makes weaning the country off very low interest rates much more difficult, since any significant rise in rates is going to eat deep into disposable incomes, and therefore harm demand in the wider economy. Cheap money in turn only encourages more mortgage borrowing, further adding to household debt and wider economic vulnerabilities.\par \par \uc2 Personally, I think the situation is already serious enough to justify urgent interest rate action. As a pedant on such matters, I don't much like use of so\u8211\'20\'13called "macro\u8211\'20\'13prudential tools", because this is just credit rationing by another name and I can't see how limiting demand for something is ever going to be a good solution. We may have come to dislike ever rising house prices, but the return of mortgage queues would be even less welcome.\par \par \uc2 All the same, the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  is plainly preparing to give such tools a go, and in the absence of any credible supply side fix, I'm at least prepared to reserve judgment.\par \par \uc2 Experience from abroad is mixed. Cooling measures such as higher capital requirements on mortgage lending, tougher loan\u8211\'20\'13to\u8211\'20\'13value criteria, and the imposition of loan\u8211\'20\'13to\u8211\'20\'13income rules, have achieved some success in both Sweden and Singapore.\par \par \uc2 Again, much higher minimum deposits for second mortgages are said to have had a significant impact on speculative buying in Singapore, even if it has only pushed many Singaporeans into buying in London instead. Indeed, the policy has been so successful that local developers complain of a growing overhang of vacant property. A hard landing in the housing market may not matter so much in a fast\u8211\'20\'13growing surplus economy such as Singapore; it matters a lot for an economy as dependent on house prices for confidence as the UK.\par \par \uc2 Something has to be done to free the British economy of its addiction to rising house prices. To me, this now seems as big a structural challenge for the UK economy as high levels of ordinary price inflation were in the Seventies and Eighties. There is ultimately only one solution, but we seem too cowardly to grasp it.\par \par \uc2 UK dwellings price Index February 2002=100 200 190 180 170 160 150 140 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 Source: ONS Starts and completions England 12 month rolling totals, 000s 200 180 160 120 100 80 140 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 Source: ONS Starts Completions\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140506ea560001c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw142\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 News | POPULATION\par \par \uc2 Britain's five largest ethnic minorities are growing so fast that by 2050 they could constitute more than a fifth of the total population, a report concludes today.\par \par \uc2 The conjecture is not meant as a warning to white Britain that its identity is under threat.\par \par \uc2 The authors, both from ethnic minorities, have compiled their report, entitled A Portrait of Modern Britain, to celebrate 'melting pot' Britain.\par \par \uc2 They argue that politicians should stop treating ethnic minorities as one homogeneous group and start appealing to the varied political views and concerns of non-white Britons.\par \par \uc2 The report argues that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  since the Second World War has resulted in diverse groups with widely differing opinions and traditions. It says politicians have failed to address these groups individually and says there are "clear and meaningful differences between each of these communities, which need to be fully understood" by policymakers.\par \par \uc2 Rishi Sunak, the co-author and the head of Policy Exchange's BME Research Unit, said: "These communities will continue to become an ever more significant part of Britain, especially in future elections."\par \par \uc2 The report draws on survey, census, academic and polling data to build a detailed picture of the five largest minority groups: Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black African and Black Caribbean. It says currently eight million people, or 14 per cent of the UK population, are from ethnic minorities.\par \par \uc2 It claims that with the exception of those with an African heritage, a majority of non-white Britons describe themselves as "British-only".\par \par \uc2 The right-leaning think tank says that currently voters in black and minority ethnic communities overwhelmingly identify with and vote for the Labour Party "regardless of class or association with Conservative policies", with 68 per cent voting for \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 's party at the 2010 General Election, compared with 16 per cent for the Conservatives and 14 per cent for the Liberal Democrats.\par \par \uc2 The report cites work based on the 2001 census by Professor Philip Rees, of \uc2 Leeds University\uc2 , who calculated that the size of the ethnic minority population will double to 16 million, and will make up 20 per cent of the population by 2051.\par \par \uc2 The authors suggest that when the figures are revised to take in the 2010 census, that 20 per cent figure will be higher.\par \par \uc2 Around 21 per cent of Team GB's gold medals at the 2012 London Olympics - including individual and team sports - were won by \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  or those with \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  parents.\par \par \uc2 Drinking from the one cup The Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin (pictured), a parish priest in east London and chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, was born in Jamaica and believes that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has helped to warm up the "cold" British.\par \par \uc2 "The majority of those from the Caribbean who came to Britain in the late 50s and throughout the 60s and 70s were Christians... Sadly, they discovered that the church was not waiting with arms outstretched to welcome them," she said.\par \par \uc2 "Today in our inner cities, up and down the country, our churches are filled with significant numbers of those from the minority ethnic community.\par \par \uc2 "Their children fill the Sunday schools and our schools. The reality is that we are looking at second, third and fourth generations now.\par \par \uc2 "The majority of the minority ethnic population cannot be referred to as a migrant community.\par \par \uc2 "They are British; they belong here; this is their home. They do not want to be tolerated and they do not want to be treated as visitors. It is important to note that church is the one place where we have people from different cultures and class meeting and 'drinking from the one cup'."\par \par \uc2 Document IIND000020140506ea5600006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Comment\par \b \uc2 Despite appearances, it's Miliband, not Farage, who's breaking with tradition and upsetting the status quo\b0\par\par\uc2 Steve Richards   \par \uc2 803 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par \uc2 The Independent\par \uc2 IND\par \uc2 1ST\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Comment\par \par \uc2 There is a striking disparity between the perception of two party leaders and the policies they espouse. Nigel Farage triumphs as the anti-establishment outsider, challenging orthodoxies and fuelling the anti-politics mood of which he is a beneficiary. Meanwhile, suffering poor personal ratings, Ed Miliband is viewed as part of the loathed Westminster establishment, a former minister who has spent most of his life in politics.\par \par \uc2 Such perceptions are easily formed. Farage has never been a minister. He has no record to defend. He is not an MP at Westminster. Miliband was briefly a TV producer on a political programme before becoming a special adviser at Westminster. He has worked at Westminster ever since.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2 's BBC show staged an illuminating sequence, one that showed how easily formed perceptions are misleading. There was an interview with Farage followed by one with Miliband. Finally, the two sat together and had a mini-debate. What became clear was how much Farage is a product of the Thatcherite 1980s, at least as much as \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 . Indeed I suspect if Margaret Thatcher were still active she would be a fan of Ukip, or at least urging Cameron to be more Ukip-like. Her voice is not required in that respect because Cameron is to some extent dancing to Ukip's tunes. He does so partly out of fear, but also because there is quite a lot on which he and Farage agree.\par \par \uc2 Both men are small-state economic liberals, except in relation to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Farage supports a so-called flat tax, one rate of tax on all earners. Osborne's first move as shadow Chancellor in 2005 was to declare his interest in a flat tax, a support that faded only when the likes of The Economist dismissed the idea as being too right-wing.\par \par \uc2 Farage wants a smaller state. The essence of Cameron and Osborne's economic policies has been to regard the state as the cause of the crash in 2008, in the form of too much public spending. They too seek a smaller, less active state. As Cameron declared at the beginning of his leadership, there IS such a thing as society but it is not the same as the state - an elegant reworking of Thatcherism.\par \par \uc2 Miliband and Farage were something of a novelty on Marr. What also became clear in the programme was the degree to which Miliband seeks a break with current orthodoxies. While Cameron, the 1980s free marketer, stands back as \uc2 Pfizer\uc2  proposes to take over \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2 , Miliband proposes intervention. This is not merely opportunism on his behalf. His belief that government can make a positive difference is the essential dividing line at the next election.\par \par \uc2 Since 1979, orthodoxy insists that the state is always stifling, that it wrecks markets. On the whole this remains the instinct of Farage, Cameron and some of the more extreme Blairites.\par \par \uc2 On the other side of this divide there is Miliband, Michael Heseltine, John Major (at least in relation to the energy market), Vince Cable, and more rounded Blairites like Alan Johnson, who in an interview yesterday, urged Miliband to propose a wider range of interventions.\par \par \uc2 Their advocacy of state intervention would be mainstream in most equivalent countries. As Miliband said on Sunday, there is no other government that would sit back and let a significant takeover happen without getting involved. In the UK, Miliband's arguments mark a big leap.\par \par \uc2 Of course, Farage seeks to leap out of Europe, and Cameron pledges an in/out referendum that could also lead to such a big jump, but these two positions are also a consequence of 1980s and 1990s-style politics, an assumption that the EU is to blame for virtually everything.\par \par \uc2 I have argued before that it is tempting to follow the personalities rather than the policy trail - good old Nigel with his pint and cigarette; emollient Dave. When Miliband tries to look like the outsider, addressing small groups with a loudspeaker in town centres, he looks silly. He reinforces a sense that he is an insider uncomfortable with a more challenging environment. When Farage does the same he seems the perfect fit, one of "us" raging against the political consensus.\par \par \uc2 But follow the more important policy trail and Farage moves closer to the consensus. Harold Macmillan's policies were well to the left of Cameron's. In policy terms, if voters want more of the same they must choose between Farage and Cameron. Perhaps a majority of voters in England will opt for variations of that status quo.\par \par \uc2 But in policy terms there is only one candidate for significant change and it is not Farage.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140506ea5600020\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 UK ethnic population to boom to 1 in 3 Brits by 2051, new study reveals\b0\par\par\uc2 By Martyn Brown   \par \uc2 518 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par 03:33\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 ONE in three people in Britain will be from an ethnic minority by the middle of the century, a report forecasts today.\par \par \uc2 It will rocket from the current figure of eight per cent to as much as 30 per cent \u8211\'20\'13 a total of 23 million \u8211\'20\'13 over the next 40 years, it said.\par \par \uc2 The study by influential think-tank Policy Exchange lays bare the effect of decades of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and reveals the huge impact of Labour\u8217\'20\'19s open door policy to migrants between 1997 and 2010.\par \par \uc2 It also supports previous studies which have shown Britain will be the Western world\u8217\'20\'19s most ethnically diverse nation after 2050.\par \par \uc2 The report reveals that the population from the five largest distinct black and minority ethnic communities could rocket from eight million to 23 million people by 2051.\par \par \uc2 By then the UK\u8217\'20\'19s population is forecast to hit 77 million. One in three children at state schools today is from an ethnic minority.\par \par \uc2 The report, A Portrait of Modern Britain, draws on an extensive set of survey, census, academic and polling data to build up a detailed picture of the five largest minority groups in the UK \u8211\'20\'13 Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, black Africans and black Caribbeans.\par \par \uc2 It reveals that black Africans and Bangladeshis are the fastest growing of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s ethnic minorities.\par \par \uc2 Adam Afriyie is the first black Conservative MP [REX]\par \par \uc2 The study also shows that while Britain has changed and is continuing to become even more multi-racial, people from ethnic minority backgrounds have a far stronger association with being British than the white population.\par \par \uc2 In the 2011 Census, only 14 per cent of whites identified themselves as being purely British, with 64 per cent seeing themselves as English.\par \par \uc2 All other ethnic minority communities were more than four times more likely to associate themselves with being British.\par \par \uc2 Some 71 per cent of Bangladeshis and 63 per cent of Pakistanis considered themselves purely British. A quarter of the black Caribbean community see themselves as English, while 55 per cent see themselves as just British.\par \par \uc2 Rishi Sunak, co-author of the report, said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe face of Britain has changed and will keep changing over the next 30 years.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFrom the post-war arrival of Jamaicans and Indians to the recent influx of Africans, the UK is now home to a melting pot of different cultures and traditions. These communities will continue to become an ever more significant part of Britain, especially in future elections.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The think-tank says that currently voters from ethnic groups overwhelmingly identify with and vote for the Labour Party.

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Ex-Brussels counsel claims new EU law not required\par \par \uc2 Piris sees other ways to meet premier's demands\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's demands to renegotiate British membership of the EU would not necessarily require a treaty change, according to the top Brussels lawyer who helped to draft every EU treaty from Maastricht to Lisbon.\par \par \uc2 Jean-Claude Piris, former legal counsel of the European Council and the \uc2 Council of Ministers\uc2 , said that Mr Cameron's seven key demands could be met with some deft legal drafting, provided there was political will and a mood for compromise on both sides of the negotiations.\par \par \uc2 Mr Piris's legal analysis of Mr Cameron's EU strategy for the Financial Times is likely to reinforce a view among Tory MPs that the prime minister's European strategy is too timid and open to a political fudge.\par \par \uc2 The prime minister set out some of his "key" demands in a Sunday Telegraph article in March, the closest he has come to explaining the deal he is seeking before his planned 2017 referendum on continued British membership of the EU.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron's list was calibrated to avoid any obvious deal-breakers, such as a demand for a limit on migration between existing EU members. \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2 , the German chancellor, has ruled out any unpicking of EU treaties .\par \par \uc2 Although he said his list was not comprehensive, Mr Cameron said he wanted power to "flow away" from Brussels, a greater role for national parliaments in blocking EU legislation and a cut in red tape.\par \par \uc2 His plan also called for less EU intrusion in the British justice system, restrictions on benefit claims by migrants, restrictions on "vast migrations" from new member states and "dealing properly with the concept of 'ever closer union'".\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron wants a treaty change to underpin his planned reforms but Mr Piris, head of the European Council's legal service for more than 20 years until 2010, said British demands could be accommodated in other ways.\par \par \uc2 The French lawyer said that was important because "in the medium term I don't think we will agree to a treaty at 28 member states" and even a limited treaty affecting the eurozone could be hard to agree before Mr Cameron's 2017 deadline.\par \par \uc2 "If we don't change the treaty for the eurozone, there is no way we will change the treaty just for the UK," he said. Many member states fear a new treaty, since it might trigger national referendums.\par \par \uc2 Mr Piris says much depends on whether Mr Cameron takes a tough approach and insists on enshrining his reforms in treaty change.\par \par \uc2 He said the Lisbon treaty already allowed for powers to flow from Brussels back to member states, although putting that into practice would require widespread EU agreement.\par \par \uc2 Mr Piris said a political commitment could reinforce the existing role of national parliaments in scrutinising new EU laws, although that would not allow them to block new proposals.\par \par \uc2 Reducing red tape would require political will rather than a treaty change, while Mr Cameron's criticisms of the \uc2 European Court of Human Rights\uc2  refer to a body that works under the framework of the \uc2 Council of Europe\uc2 , not the EU. Britain already enjoys extensive opt-outs from EU justice and police co-operation.\par \par \uc2 The EU could toughen rules on benefit claims by migrants without treaty change, while accession treaties for new member states could apply longer "transitional" rules on free movement of workers.\par \par \uc2 Even on the commitment to "ever closer union among the peoples of Europe", Mr Piris said a political declaration might be drafted recalling that the current treaty obliges the EU to respect the history, national identities and political and constitutional structures of member states.\par \par \uc2 "If the current mood among most EU governments continues to try to improve the functioning of the EU while absolutely avoiding a revision of the treaties, most of Mr Cameron's demands as presented in his Telegraph article could nevertheless be given adequate answers," Mr Piris said.\par \par \uc2 "However, the hardest would be to get the political will from others to "repatriate" powers from Brussels."\par \par \uc2 David Lidington, Europe minister, said: "A large amount can be achieved without treaty change but we think some treaty change will be required."\par \par \uc2 Mats Persson, head of the Open Europe think-tank, said Mr Cameron and Tory MPs wanted to enshrine some of the changes in treaty to prove they would "stand the test of time".\par \par \uc2 Piris's proposals The expert verdict on No 10's wish list\par \par \uc2 1 Powers flowing from Brussels, not always to it\par \par \uc2 Since the Lisbon treaty, there is no legal impediment to that.\par \par \uc2 A revision of the treaties is possible either to increase or to reduce the competencies conferred on the union in the treaties. Member states may request the commission to submit proposals to repeal a legislative act.\par \par \uc2 The \u64258\'FB\'02ow of powers in the case of shared powers with the member states is limited.\par \par \uc2 2 National parliaments able to block EU legislation\par \par \uc2 Under Lisbon, either one-third or one-quarter of national parliaments, according to the area concerned, may oblige the commission to review a piece of legislation.\par \par \uc2 This has rarely been used: the delays imposed on national parliaments are too short, and their opinions are not binding.\par \par \uc2 System could be improved: political commitment to follow national parliament conclusions?\par \par \uc2 3 Prevention of further EU red tape\par \par \uc2 Firstly, by construction, one EU legislation replaces 28 national laws and allows the single market to function better.\par \par \uc2 Secondly, preventing EU legislation from creating red tape is day-to-day work, which is taken more seriously today by the member states and the EU institutions.\par \par \uc2 However, there is no simple legal option available to avoid red tape: this cannot be decided by a treaty.\par \par \uc2 4 European human rights court\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Court of Human Rights\uc2  works in the framework of the \uc2 Council of Europe\uc2 : it is not part of the EU.\par \par \uc2 As for the EU, the UK has already obtained several opt-outs from policies in that domain, including Schengen and the area of freedom, security and justice. It has a special position on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.\par \par \uc2 5 Freedom of movement to take up work, not benefits\par \par \uc2 This is an issue on which several EU states agree.\par \par \uc2 There were some limited abuses and a stricter interpretation, or even legislative improvement, has been asked for. This does not need any treaty change.\par \par \uc2 The principle of free movement of EU citizens is a cornerstone of the treaty: its questioning would be a non- starter for most EU states.\par \par \uc2 6 Continuing enlargement without vast migrations\par \par \uc2 A treaty of accession has to be negotiated, signed and rati\u64257\'FB\'01ed by each EU state.\par \par \uc2 The past two treaties included an option for member states to suspend \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from new members for seven years.\par \par \uc2 Future treaties of accession could include longer periods of adaptation and safeguard measures. But questioning the very principle of free movement of persons would be a non-starter.\par \par \uc2 7 Ever closer union among the people of Europe\par \par \uc2 The process of creating an ever closer union is enshrined in the treaty. But the political concept does not have the aim of establishing a federal union.\par \par \uc2 The treaty obliges the EU to respect the history, culture and traditions of the peoples of Europe and to respect national identities of states and their fundamental structures.\par \par \uc2 Maybe a political declaration recalling that, would help.\par \par \uc2 8 Protecting the rights of non-euro countries\par \par \uc2 Not mentioned in Mr Cameron's Telegraph article.\par \par \uc2 Non-eurozone members fear the eurozone will integrate further and adopt decisions that have a negative impact on them.\par \par \uc2 In the medium term the eurozone could reassure them in a new treaty of their legal obligation to guarantee the rights of non eurozone countries.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140506ea5600009\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Small private airfields, helipads and even farmers\u8217\'20\'19 fields are being used by smugglers and people traffickers as a weak link in Britain\u8217\'20\'19s border security.\par \par \uc2 Microlights, helicopters and private business jets are being used to fly drugs, guns and explosives to remote or unstaffed airstrips where security is weaker or impracticable. Illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are also being transported in this way, police say.\par \par \uc2 There are more than 3,000 small landing sites in Britain, from private aerodromes and small flying clubs to old bomber bases and grass strips surrounded by farmland. There are 20,000 light aircraft and almost 47,000 licensed pilots.\par \par \uc2 Growing concern about the use of the landing sites by organised crime gangs has prompted an appeal for help from people living near private airfields by the National Crime Agency, UK Border Force and the \uc2 Association of Chief Police Officers\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 They want people to report the appearance of windsocks or lights at odd times, unusual activity around an aircraft once it lands, aircraft that are covered in mud, or packages being dropped from low-flying aircraft.\par \par \uc2 People who fly from or work at private airfields or flying clubs have been urged to report aircraft that have been modified to adapt their range or load or carry extra fuel, unexplained damage to aircraft, or pilots joining a club and flying to unusual destinations, especially long-distance foreign flights with only a brief stay.\par \par \uc2 Suspicion may also be aroused by pilots who are determined to fly in poor weather or low light, who land short of their notified destination, who disguise flight plans, or who are evasive about passengers or routes.\par \par \uc2 Police and security chiefs have also asked people to look out for activity that could be reconnaissance by criminals to test or research security around an airfield, or for visitors who buy uniforms, badges and other equipment.\par \par \uc2 All forms of private aviation are thought to be at risk of exploitation by smugglers, including gliding, parachuting and aerial surveys.\par \par \uc2 David Armond, director of the National Crime Agency\u8217\'20\'19s border policing command, said: \u8220\'20\'1CThis is an area where we are convinced the public can really help law enforcement disrupt criminal activity. You might have seen unfamiliar people in sensitive areas of the airport, or unusual patterns of activity such as night-time airdrops. That information could be key to an investigation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The agency asked people who saw suspicious activity to note the date and time and details of the aircraft, such as a description of markings and modifications, and of the pilot or crew.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140505ea56002ta\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 National Insurance figures paint an alarming picture of \uc2 immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 437 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par 01:01\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 EACH week no fewer than 4,000 National Insurance numbers are given to migrants from Eastern Europe.\par \par \uc2 But even this staggering figure fails to reveal the true scale of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  for those who apply for NI numbers are those who intend to work and pay tax, not those who don\u8217\'20\'19t.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 This is one of the facts to emerge about EU migration from new data published by the Department for Work and Pensions showing where migrants have settled in the UK.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The 1.2 million Poles have tended to settle in north London, Edinburgh and Birmingham. Lithuanians go to agricultural East Anglia, Romanians and Bulgarians make for the Welsh borders and Czechs favour Manchester.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Since 2002, 2.3 million migrants from former communist countries have moved here and last year saw more arrive here than at any time since 2008.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Significantly these figures do not include the Romanians and Bulgarians who have come here since the beginning of the year when visa restrictions were dropped.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 We are used to hearing about such large numbers of people but having a sense of where they are settling, swelling and changing the face of entire regions brings home the sense of an unstoppable movement that is beyond the control of government or local authorities.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 And these, remember, are the migrants we know about, not the ones living in garden sheds or with criminal intent.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 No wonder Ukip is riding high in the polls.

Quite rightly we want carrying a knife to be regarded as a serious matter.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Yet in more innocent times all small boys carried a penknife and a piece of string in their pockets. And many will sympathise with Chief Scout Bear Grylls when he says that all children should be given penknives so they can learn to use them responsibly.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 A toxic combination of fear of crime and a desire to mollycoddle children has led us to this lamentable state of affairs where a pocket knife is viewed only as a deadly weapon rather than a useful tool.\par \par \uc2 ..........................................................................................................\par \par \uc2 British cup that cheers\par \par \uc2 Nine out of 10 of us say a cup of tea is the most British drink of all, good first thing in the morning and in times of crisis.

\par\par \uc2 NEWS\par \b \uc2 A nation so many are proud to call their own\b0\par\par\uc2 By Telegraph View   \par \uc2 473 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par 01:01\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 A majority of members of ethnic minorities in this country consider themselves British - a reminder of how important and splendid a concept Britain is\par \par \uc2 On the face of it, new research by the Policy Exchange think tank into modern Britain suggests that our country is changing at a staggering rate. By 2050, it says, one in three people in England and Wales will come from an ethnic minority, a demographic change driven by higher birth rates as well as \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Further, the report also suggests that, among the five largest minority groups, only 20 per cent of those surveyed identified themselves as English, compared with more than 60 per cent of white people. Among many, those figures will understandably prompt a concern that our sense of national solidarity is being eroded.\par \par \uc2 There is, however, a more positive story contained in the figures. Because while ethnic minority citizens may not call themselves English, on the whole, a good majority describe themselves as British. Among British Indians and Pakistanis, more than 60 per cent consider themselves British; among Bangladeshis, that figure is 74 per cent. The numbers are lower among black Africans and Caribbeans, but none the less, the picture is a heartening one. Britain has taken these citizens (or rather, in most cases, their parents or grandparents) in, and made them its own; and they, in turn, make Britain theirs.\par \par \uc2 It is a reminder of what a unifying concept Britain is. It includes separate nations in a single state, allowing each their own identity while binding them into a larger whole; it has welcomed, over its long and varied history, invaders and refugees and \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , and been changed by all, while remaining fundamentally the same. Its constancy in the face of change, like its unity from divided parts, ought to be a contradiction, and yet it is not.\par \par \uc2 There is much to be proud of in this idea; yet it is under attack on two fronts. One is to the north: \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  and his Yes campaign will try to tear the Union apart later this year, when the referendum on Scottish independence takes place. For all his soothing noises about how nothing will really change, Britain, as we know it, may no longer exist.\par \par \uc2 The second is to the south, where Nigel Farage and Ukip are leading the polls for the approaching European elections. While it is true that uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  carries risks, the tone of Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s campaign is entirely at odds with the inclusive picture of Britain that the Policy Exchange research paints.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, Mr Salmond and Mr Farage do not represent the country as a whole. As today\u8217\'20\'19s report shows, Britain is a nation that even its newest citizens are proud to call their own.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140505ea5600565\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Features Pages\par \b \uc2 G2: Arts: How we made ... Goodness Gracious Me 'How could a show with more than 100 characters in it be peddling stereotypes?'\b0\par\par\uc2 741 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Meera Syal, writer and performer\par \par \uc2 In the mid-1990s, nobody knew what British-Asian comedy was. It had never been seen on TV. I'm not sure we really knew what it was ourselves. But there was a small live comedy scene, and we thought a TV sketch show could be something our community would watch. We had no idea if it could cross over into the mainstream.\par \par \uc2 I was a performer-writer on [BBC comedy show] The Real McCoy, where Anil Gupta was script editor. I was thrilled to be working on it, but it was an African-Caribbean TV show, very culturally specific. So Anil and I started chatting about doing something similar about British Asians. He got a team together and the BBC helped us to do a live stage show.\par \par \uc2 This went so well we were asked to do a pilot for Radio 4. They gave us the graveyard slot: 11pm on a summer Friday. We knew British Asians wouldn't be listening then. It would be middle England. And there was an amazing reaction - I think it really made the BBC sit up. We were offered a radio series, then a TV pilot, then a TV series. But it wasn't easy. It was a long, hard slog.\par \par \uc2 There were five of us at first: me, \uc2 Sanjeev Bhaskar\uc2 , Kulvinder Ghir, Nina Wadia and [the musician] Nitin Sawhney. Working together felt like coming home. We'd all grown up thinking, "Am I the only one who finds it funny that everyone covers their sofas in plastic, and has a drawer full of \uc2 Tupperware\uc2 ?" With these guys, I could just say, "\uc2 Tupperware\uc2 " and everyone would go, "Yeah!" I'd found my comedy tribe.\par \par \uc2 Sanjeev Bhaskar\uc2 , writer and performer\par \par \uc2 Goodness Gracious Me changed everything for me. I was doing a standup show with Nitin Sawhney called The Secret Asians. Anil Gupta and another writer from the BBC, the late Sharat Sardana, came to see a gig in a tiny studio in south London. They'd tossed a coin: heads, they'd come to our gig; tails, they'd go to the pub. Afterwards, they told us our act had exactly what they were after for a new sketch show.\par \par \uc2 I'd spent my 20s in marketing; suddenly I was 32 and working with this amazing group of proper actors. I'd seen Meera perform before, but this was the first time I'd worked with her. That, of course, would later turn out to be important personally as well as professionally. [The pair married in 2005.]\par \par \uc2 I was surprised by the degree to which the show was embraced by people outside the British-Asian community. A lot of the sketches were universal, I suppose - about families, greed, ambition, expectation, duty. My guru character was one of my favourites: he was a charlatan who answered any question about eastern culture with a reference to Star Wars or the Queen. I also remember a very funny version of Brief Encounter, set in an Indian railway station: the couple's long goodbye keeps getting interrupted by hawkers.\par \par \uc2 We did get some negative reactions from the British-Asian community, particularly from the older generation. One guy came up to me in the street and said: "Why are you washing our dirty linen in public?" I said: "Wouldn't you rather your dirty linen was washed?" Someone else told me the show was just peddling stereotypes. I pointed out that we had more than 100 characters: how can you have 100 stereotypes?\par \par \uc2 I understood where these concerns were coming from, though. As an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  culture, part of the unspoken message we were given was not to draw attention to ourselves. Goodness Gracious Me must have seemed as if it was mocking all that. But people seemed to come round when they realised that we weren't coming from a malicious place. We weren't denying who we were: we were targeting British behaviour and attitudes. We were all British Asians, with the "British" coming first.\par \par \uc2 Interviews by \uc2 Laura Barnett\uc2 . A special one-off episode of Goodness Gracious Me will be shown on BBC2 on 26 May.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 'I'd found my comedy tribe' . . .

And will vitamin drinks and dad naps be enough to keep them going? Laura Barnett hits the road with Kitten Pyramid\b0\par\par\uc2 1,549 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A tin of chicken soup, a Kinder egg, a bag of salt and vinegar crisps, and a sponge. These are the items I'm given, in a carrier bag, when I arrive in Shrewsbury to set off on tour with Kitten Pyramid - Britain's latest, and probably most surreal, purveyors of prog rock. "Your welcome pack," says bass player Mark Hamon, who has a tufty yellow beard and a tattoo of an octopus on his right shin. "What's the sponge for?" I ask. Hamon's smile broadens. "You'll find out."\par \par \uc2 In the world of Kitten Pyramid, such a random collection of objects makes a kind of sense. Formed in Burton upon Trent in 2010 by songwriter Scott Milligan, the band is a loose five-piece, swelling to 14 for some gigs (when guitars, bass and drums are joined by trumpets and strings). Out this month, their first album is called Uh-Oh! and is pitched somewhere between Talking Heads at their most fractious and strange, and Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd.\par \par \uc2 Lyrically, Milligan's songs are both hilarious and bizarre. "I want to see you naked in a caravan," he reveals on Chester. Elsewhere, he sings the praises of "gorilla fajitas", "ladybird jumpers", and a "pyramid army with their bags of peshwari". Clearly, Milligan is bored by conventional pop. But much of Uh-Oh!'s freshness and richness springs from the fact that it's a concept album inspired by Milligan's late Uncle Jarek, a Polish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  who had schizophrenia.\par \par \uc2 To launch it, and to draw attention to the issues around mental health, Kitten Pyramid have put together their own idiosyncratic tour - of psychiatric hospitals, performing for patients and staff, with each daytime hospital session followed by an evening gig in a pub. Their aim is to raise money for, and awareness of, Arts for Health (AFH), an arm of the band's local \uc2 NHS\uc2  trust, South Staffordshire and Shropshire, which organises arts events for patients.\par \par \uc2 All of which explains why, still puzzled by my welcome pack, I am watching Kitten Pyramid perform in Redwoods hospital on the outskirts of Shrewsbury. The gig takes place in the bright, domed foyer, around a splendid grand piano, with a string of fairylights marking out a makeshift stage. The band kick off quietly, strumming through Red Shoes, a song that traces feelings of alienation in a supermarket. "You can't look down," Milligan sings, "because she'll think you're weird." The woman sitting beside me has a complaint. "I can't hear you!" she shouts. "Louder?" asks Milligan. "Yes!" the audience call back as one.\par \par \uc2 John, sitting next to me, tells me he recently lost his wife, Glenys, to early-onset Alzheimer's. They used to go to singing workshops run by AFH. "Even when she was hardly able to speak," says John, "she could still sing whole lines from her favourite songs. Music is incredibly powerful for people with dementia. It seems to stir up so many memories."\par \par \uc2 Certainly, something similar seems to be happening today. As the band play Whale, a track that requires the audience to shout the song's title at regular intervals, even the most distracted patients seem to sharpen their focus. An elderly woman with a cotton cloud of white hair taps out a steady rhythm on the footrest of her wheelchair. "It was wonderful," she tells me afterwards. "I used to be a ballet dancer. Listening to the music brought it all back."\par \par \uc2 Jessica Kent, the AFH manager behind the concert, thinks the band went down well. "Kitten Pyramid have a unique sound," she says. "It's like a musical patchwork, with something all ages seem able to relate to. It's so important to have events like this in psychiatric hospitals. The age of the asylum is over. New psychiatric hospitals are very different places."\par \par \uc2 As we all sit down to post-gig fish-finger sandwiches in a nearby pub, Milligan tells me the album's concept began with a bus. "Where I used to live," he says, "was opposite a bus-stop. I was sitting in my bedroom one day, looking out the window, when a bus arrived. I started thinking how weird it would be if I climbed into a bus with no driver, no passengers, and the bus took me to Burton, and there was nobody anywhere. Then I started to think that maybe this was the sort of thing my Uncle Jarek used to experience."\par \par \uc2 Milligan fleshed out his daydream until he had a detailed treatment for a film (his day job involves making lawyer training videos). In the meantime, he set about bringing together musicians to work on songs he'd composed over the last decade. He soon realised most of them touched, to some extent, on Jarek's condition. "One song, Fire, is about the time my uncle set fire to a brand-new mattress," he says. "Not all the songs are that specific, but a lot of them relate to what my uncle went through."\par \par \uc2 Kitten Pyramid were born. Milligan secured a bank loan to record an album and, in January 2013, the core five-piece - Milligan, Hamon, drummer Rob Redfern, guitarists Chris Baldwin and Dan Baker - went into the studio with producer Nick Brine, best known for his work with Oasis, the Stone Roses and Super Furry Animals. Uh-Oh! was the result.\par \par \uc2 The trouble with concept albums is that they can be a bit, well, conceptual: they can risk sacrificing musical coherence to high-art pretension. But Milligan's songs would still make an impact without any knowledge of the underpinning concept. "What sets this apart from other concept albums," says Baker, "is that we're not ponces."\par \par \uc2 Milligan is still planning to make his film. Each band member has been assigned a character: Milligan a psychiatric nurse, the luxuriantly bearded Baker a bear. There's talk of a musical. All this from a band that are unsigned. When I ask if they're looking for a major label, Milligan looks anxious. "This way," he says, "we have more freedom."\par \par \uc2 They are making no money from their tour: the hospital concerts are unpaid, and they're donating a pound to AFH from every CD sale. What's more, they've all had to take time off from their day jobs, which range from teaching to construction. There's no tour bus either: sustained by \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2  and elaborate in-jokes about dolphins, they're travelling in a Ford Focus and a \uc2 Volkswagen\uc2  Polo, although sometimes they get to pile into the "jaffa cake", Hamon's orange and brown VW campervan. Their stimulants of choice are "dad naps" (they range from 31 to 45, and they all have young children) and vitamin drinks spiked with Solpadeine.\par \par \uc2 It's all quite un-rock'n'roll - and rather refreshing and cheering, especially when it's clear how well the band's gigs go down, both in and out of psychiatric hospitals. After Redwoods, they hit an open-mic night in the Wrekin Inn in Telford, where the walls are lined with posters for the 1960s psychedelic band the Groundhogs (its founding member Tony McPhee's partner, Jo, runs the open mic). Kitten Pyramid blow the place away, with shouts of "Whale!" threatening to lift the roof. By the end of the set, two locals ("Juke Joint" John and "Dead Hand" Terry) have joined them on harmonica and kazoo.\par \par \uc2 The next day takes us to St George's in Stafford, where Milligan's uncle was once admitted. Kitten Pyramid are playing two concerts. The first is on a ward filled mainly with elderly patients. Between songs, an old man in a hospital gown shouts huskily: "Brilliant!" His name is Tony and he loves the blues. "Loved this, too," he says. "They blew my head."\par \par \uc2 Later, in a therapy room, the band perform shoeless and cross-legged beneath a board advertising classes: Monday is relaxation, Wednesday coping skills. I'm not sure which category Kitten Pyramid fall into, but their flight-of-fancy lyrics and helter-skelter guitarwork go down a storm. After the concert, one patient comes over. "Hopefully I'll get out quicker now," he says with a grin. "You've put me back on my feet."\par \par \uc2 It is this kind of reaction that makes all the hassles - the long drives, the dad naps, the Solpadeine cocktails - worthwhile. "That's what it's all for," Hamon says as we load the equipment back into the cars. With my somewhat surreal stint as roadie now at an end, I look again inside the bag they gave me. I never got the chance to eat the chicken soup - and I still have no idea what the sponge was for.\par \par \uc2 Uh-Oh! is out on 26 May. Kitten Pyramid play Newhall Social Club on 30 May and the Alsager Music Festival in Milton Park on 12 July.

We guide you through the post-election scenarios, and take into account Scotland's vote on independence. While ahead in the voting intention polls, Ed Miliband's lead is said to be soft because he is consistently behind on the questions of leadership and economic stewardship, which are generally thought to settle elections. Labour's hopes rest on the apparent failure of the recovery to translate into rising living standards, the faith that the tide of history has turned against the free market right, and wear and tear blighting a five-year-old Cameron administration.\par \par \uc2 Scotland factor After a yes vote Labour would lose 40-odd Scottish MPs, a year into the parliament, so if Labour did win in 2015 its future would be immediately in doubt.\par \par \uc2 Labour/Lib Dem coalition\par \par \uc2 The polling and the electoral system point to this being relatively likely. Even if the Tories catch up with Labour on share of the poll, the electoral system could still hand Labour the edge. More opposition voters live in more electorally propitious places, and too many Conservatives turn out in safe seats; Labour seats also have fewer potential voters on average. All this makes it more likely that Labour will be pushed decisively over the winning line by a majority with a diminished Lib Dem party. Most Lib Dem activists would probably be keen. Clegg might be less comfortable, but the betting must be that he would not last long after the end of the Tory partnership. The relative stability of the Cameron years would probably incline Miliband to a partnership, rather than seek to go it alone. But would his party let him?\par \par \uc2 Labour minority\par \par \uc2 Deep tribal feelings, which can be traced to Ramsay MacDonald's move into the National Government in 1931, associate coalition with betrayal. Allergy to coalition is not a preserve of the Labour left, either - in 2010 \uc2 John Reid\uc2  and David Blunkett were early voices raised against trying to stitch together a Lib/Lab deal. If Labour comes out ahead in seats in 2015, some within its ranks will say that the very idea of coalition is discredited and urge the party to follow \uc2 Harold Wilson\uc2 's precedent in the face of a micro-majority in 1964 and a hung parliament of 1974, which is to govern alone for a short spell before going back to the electorate to try for a working majority.\par \par \uc2 Labour rainbow coalition\par \par \uc2 The idea of all anti-Conservative parties standing together in a progressive government was mooted after the last election. Plaid Cymru and the Northern Irish SDLP could be reasonable allies, but they are likely to be few in number. If the single Green MP, Caroline Lucas, were re-elected (which is uncertain) and even joined by a colleague or two, Labour would be nervous about how long a programme for government would endure with a party that has some protest movement instincts. By far the most important stripe in the rainbow (besides the Lib Dems, who some on the left no longer class as progressive) would be the Scottish National party. But its relations with Labour are poisonous.\par \par \uc2 Scotland factor After a yes vote all sorts of temporary arrangements could become possible. After a decisive no vote, a bruised SNP might not be in any mood to help Labour.\par \par \uc2 Conservative majority\par \par \uc2 No party of government completing a proper stretch in office has increased its share of the vote since 1955, when new prime minister Anthony Eden went to the country to seek a fresh mandate and romped home with nearly 50% of the poll. \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  could muster only 36% of the UK-wide ballot when up against \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 's fag-end administration in 2010. Next year he will almost certainly need to expand his appeal to secure an outright majority. Cameron's hopes of defying the record books rest on the economic recovery, and the reality that all politics is relative - so that even if voters do not "do gratitude" some may switch to him out of fear of an Ed Miliband administration.\par \par \uc2 Scotland factor If Cameron again came just short after a yes vote, the secession of Scottish MPs in (probably) 2016 could well lend him a majority, although whether he could survive in these circumstances is moot.\par \par \uc2 Conservative/Lib Dem coalition\par \par \uc2 Although the continuation of the status quo is always easy to countenance, there are substantial obstacles in the way of the Cameron/Clegg partnership continuing past 2015. Personal relations have been strained and Cameron's recent insistence that an in/out EU referendum would be a red line for negotiating any future coalition would make the haggling even harder: Clegg's deepest political commitment is to the European project. Nonetheless, with the right parliamentary arithmetic Cameron and Clegg might be tempted to go for it again - so long as their parties would let them.\par \par \uc2 Scotland factor The Lib Dems are disproportionately represented in Scotland. So if Scottish MPs were set to leave Westminster, the prospective usefulness of coalition would diminish to the Tories.\par \par \uc2 Conservative minority\par \par \uc2 Relations between the two coalition parties are even more strained than those between the men at the top. Tories blame the Lib Dems for a lack of red meat on tax and deregulation, while the Lib Dems have criticised Tory stances on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , human rights, and Europe. If, as the polls suggest, both parties win fewer seats than in 2010, neither would be enthusiastic about keeping a partner of sagging popularity in power. So in a parliament where the Conservatives are the biggest single party, a Tory minority government becomes the most likely option, even if its lack of a majority would still preclude the sort of policies that activists are keen to see.\par \par \uc2 Scotland factor: after a yes vote, governing in a minority would be more viable and attractive for a Conservative party that would anticipate the arithmetic shifting in its favour after the ejection of the Scottish MPs.\par \par \uc2 Conservative rainbow coalition\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage has claimed his party will hold the balance of power after the next election. This is unlikely. Ukip does not have a single MP, and Farage's own recent refusal to stand in the Newark byelection indicates a lack of confidence about exceeding strong second and third places chalked up elsewhere. Even if Ukip does get a few MPs it could only make up the numbers needed for a Tory majority with exactly the right arithmetic. An understanding with the unionists could be more plausible, but the Tories might be nervous about entering the thicket of unionist policies, and making themselves hostage to unionist demands.\par \par \uc2 Scotland factor Ukip fares badly\par \par \uc2 in Scotland, so the relative clout of\par \par \uc2 any Ukip MPs, as well the Ulster\par \par \uc2 unionists, would increase after a yes vote, making this very unlikely\par \par \uc2 scenario marginally more tenable.\par \par \uc2 Analysis by Tom Clark\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140505ea560003g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Comment and Debate Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: Don't agree with Nigel: In a TV debate, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  should confront the Ukip leader, but acknowledge his appeal\b0\par\par\uc2 Melissa Kite Melissa Kite is a contributing editor of the Spectator   \par \uc2 674 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 As Nigel Farage delivers a killer line, with his customary blend of humour and pluckiness, the studio audience bursts into applause. \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  shifts uncomfortably at his podium. He opens his mouth and declares: "I agree with Nigel."\par \par \uc2 You can picture this scene only too easily. In order to win, or even survive, a TV general election debate with the insurgent Ukip leader, the prime minister may well decide that not attacking is the best form of defence. This is the big dilemma for Cameron as he prepares to square up to Farage in a series of party leader debates, now said to be likely after No 10 dropped its initial wariness and agreed in principle.\par \par \uc2 All eyes will of course be on the Dave v Nigel element. And key advisers are already split on whether the prime minister should opt for politeness or attack. The drawbacks of appearing shrill and rattled are obvious. But Tory strategists may yet decide there is an even bigger danger for Cameron if he opts for the "I agree with Nigel" strategy.\par \par \uc2 They need only remember what happened after \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  deployed the "I agree with Nick" line during the TV debates at the last election to see how this could go awry. The Lib Dem leader went from zero to hero, and then became deputy prime minister.\par \par \uc2 Those in the attack camp believe Cameron's best chance of dealing with Farage is to paint him as an extremist and stoke the fears of moderate Tories who have doubts about Ukip's credentials on race and equality.\par \par \uc2 I'm inclined to agree. I've spoken before of the sense of despair many grassroots Tories feel at being driven into the arms of Ukip. My parents, for example, feel they have no choice but to back a Ukip candidate in Warwickshire because they have been denied compensation for the catastrophic fall in value of their home thanks to HS2.\par \par \uc2 But they are not happy about it. If they vote Ukip, they will hold their noses as they do so. My father is that rare thing, a \uc2 Ken Clarke\uc2 -style pro-European. Every time there is a story about a Ukip candidate saying something idiotic, my parents get pretty depressed.\par \par \uc2 If Cameron were to come out fighting against Ukip, Conservative waverers might just listen. But it is no good him demolishing Farage without telling disaffected Tories why they should keep the faith with him instead.\par \par \uc2 The prime minister must put Farage on the spot while communicating to moderate Tories that he understands why they find him appealing. This sounds tricky. But it ought to be possible to disagree with the wilder excesses of Ukip's position on Europe, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and foreign policy, while agreeing that the party has a point when it criticises the long arm of Brussels and the pressure \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  puts on public services.\par \par \uc2 Labour had to do this when it faced a drift in its heartlands towards the BNP. No good would come of simply denouncing the tattooed skinheads. It was only when braver ministers such as Margaret Hodge acknowledged the reason for the BNP's appeal that the drifters started to return. What Hodge identified was that the rise in English nationalism in places such as Barking and Dagenham showed that her party had betrayed the white working class.\par \par \uc2 Cameron needs to demonstrate he understands that the rise of Ukip in the well-heeled Tory shires is because parts of Middle Britain feel woefully under-represented. Until he begins to acknowledge the reasons for their reluctant choice of Ukip, he cannot begin to earn himself a hearing with these people.\par \par \uc2 Maybe he doesn't have to say "I agree with Nigel." Maybe he could say "Nigel has a point, but . . ."\par \par \uc2 Melissa Kite is a contributing editor of the Spectator\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140505ea560002z\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 David Cameron pledges he WILL go head-to-head with Ukip leader Nigel Farage in televised debate in run up to 2015 general election\b0\par\par\uc2 MIA DE GRAAF   \par \uc2 564 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 May 2014\par 09:40\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

We're just not going to start negotiating now.'\par \par \uc2 Cameron notoriously lost out to his Coalition partner Nick Clegg in the first TV debates ahead of the 2010 general election.\par \par \uc2 As the least known leader at the three, Lib Dems' Mr Clegg was seen as the big winner of the first of the three debates against Labour PM Gordon Brown and Cameron, with his poll ratings rocketing to record levels.\par \par \uc2 Since taking office, the prime minister has made clear he found the debates to be a distraction to the election.\par \par \uc2 But in recent months, Cameron has come under increasing pressure to agree to a debate.\par \par \uc2 In January, Farage - who is wooing the Tory Right with his strict anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  campaign - began threatening to broadcast a rival show to voters if Cameron excludes Ukip from the debates.\par \par \uc2 He told the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s Daily Politics: \u8216\'20\'18Politics has changed a lot since 2010. We\u8217\'20\'19ve seen radical change in Scottish politics in the last decade, in Northern Irish politics and English politics is going through a big change.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I remember in 2009, when Ukip came second in the euro elections, being told it can never happen in domestic politics and in this year\u8217\'20\'19s English county elections, we got nearly a quarter of the vote.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18The point is, Ukip is now a significant force in British politics; we\u8217\'20\'19re polling double what the Lib Dems are and I think frankly, to exclude Ukip from these debates would probably give us the benefit of the underdog because it would look like the political class closing ranks on itself.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140504ea54000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

They include aerodromes, small airfields, farmers\u8217\'20\'19 field strips, and helipads.\par \par \uc2 There are almost 20,000 light aircraft registered in the UK, and 47,000 Civil Aviation Authority-licensed pilots.\par \par \uc2 The agency said that organised criminals and terrorists use the aviation sector for crimes ranging from illegal \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , importing hard drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines, and trafficking firearms.\par \par \uc2 In 2006 three members of a people smuggling gang who flew illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  into the country to secluded airstrips in Kent and the south east were convicted.\par \par \uc2 Turkish nationals were flown from locations in France and Belgium to airstrips in England. A runway in Lamberhurst was one of the places used to transport the people in a six-seater Piper Cherokee light aircraft.\par \par \uc2 David Armond, Director of the NCA\u8217\'20\'19s Border Policing Command, encouraged people living near potential landing sites to report anything unusual.\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8220\'20\'1CYou might have seen unfamiliar people in sensitive areas of the airport, or unusual patterns of activity such as night-time airdrops.\par \par \uc2 That information could be key to an investigation into an organised criminal network or terrorist group.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The National Crime Agency is asking farmers and airstrip operators to look out for planes that are \u8220\'20\'1Ccovered in mud\u8221\'20\'1D when only tarmac strips are listed on their flight plans.\par \par \uc2 Aircraft that stay \u8220\'20\'1Cvery briefly\u8221\'20\'1D a foreign destinations despite a huge effort being made to get there should also be reported.\par \par \uc2 And planes that regularly suffer minor damage and those modified to increase range or load should also be monitored, the agency says.\par \par \uc2 The NCA say that the criminals will \u8220\'20\'1Cexploit any opening they can find\u8221\'20\'1D in rural airfields, small club strips and old bomber bases.\par \par \uc2 Pilots who are inexperienced, nervous or who appear to be vulnerable to pressure should also be reported under new guidelines issued by the NCA.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140505ea55001uq\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Joe Riley on compassion in care homes, Nigel Farage and how British justice is a laughing stock\b0\par\par\uc2 By Joe Riley   \par \uc2 570 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 May 2014\par 13:54\par \uc2 liverpoolecho.co.uk\par \uc2 LIVEONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Trinity Mirror   \par \par \uc2 Columnist says too many carers are now abusers\par \par \uc2 The latest Panorama expose of staff violence and neglect in old people's \u160\'00\'A0homes is part of a growing trend of such disgraceful incidents.\par \par \uc2 Merseyside has not escaped \u160\'00\'A0its own vile incidents, including \u160\'00\'A0convictions of \u160\'00\'A0despicable carers who have robbed elderly residents or embezzled their savings.\par \par \uc2 We can no longer heed the once universal assumption that our loved ones are being compassionately treated.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0And lest we forget, many of these unfortunate folk have had to sell their homes to pay for such a so-called privileges.\par \par \uc2 The costs are astronomical \u8211\'20\'13 up to \u163\'00\'A31,000 a week \u8211\'20\'13 equivalent to full board at a top class hotel.\par \par \uc2 Which beggars belief when the majority spend most of the day sitting in a circle watching one random, blaring, TV channel and occasionally nibbling at soggy \u160\'00\'A0triangular salmon paste sandwiches.\par \par \uc2 Clearly things have to improve.

David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband have both been hit by eggs, although rather than fight back they both promptly scarpered.\par \par \uc2 So perhaps UKIP leader Nigel Farage should be worried, after he was egged during a campaign visit to Nottingham.\par \par \uc2 It suggests he\u8217\'20\'19s become part of the establishment. And that\u8217\'20\'19s the last thing he wanted to be.\par \par \uc2 The UKIP bandwagon shows no sign of stopping \u8211\'20\'13 at least, not before the European elections on May 22 \u8211\'20\'13 but not because British voters are obsessed with the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some of UKIP\u8217\'20\'19s support, at least, comes from people who are annoyed, angry or disappointed with the other parties and warm to Mr Farage because he seems like a genuine person who says what he thinks.\par \par \uc2 And that leaves the other parties in a bind. When they attack UKIP and Farage as \u8220\'20\'1Cfruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\u8221\'20\'1D, to use David Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s words, they do more harm than good.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The message is that UKIP are outside mainstream politics. They are something different and rather sinister, in the eyes of the political establishment.\par \par \uc2 But that\u8217\'20\'19s one of the reasons why people want to vote for them. Being outsiders who scare Mr Cameron is a big part of their appeal.\par \par \uc2 However, the fact remains that UKIP does seem to have recruited a number of people with unpleasant and very odd views.\par \par \uc2 There was the William Henwood, the UKIP candidate in Enfield, who said Lenny Henry \u8220\'20\'1Cshould emigrate to a black country\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Henley UKIP councillor David Silvester said recent floods were God\u8217\'20\'19s punishment for gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 UKIP Camden candidate Magnus Nielsen claimed that \u8220\'20\'1CIslam is organised crime under religious camouflage.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 And Andre Lampitt, a UKIP candidate in Merton who appeared on a party election broadcast, said Ed Miliband was \u8220\'20\'1Cnot a real Brit... he was only born here\u8221\'20\'1D, because the London-born politician is the son of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There have been occasions in the past when other parties discovered they\u8217\'20\'19d somehow recruited a someone with offensive or extreme views as a candidate.\par \par \uc2 UKIP isn\u8217\'20\'19t unique. But it does seem to have recruited rather a lot of them.\par \par \uc2 Document EVEMONL020140505ea55000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Campaigners argue that it often leads to rushed and unfair outcomes.\par \par \uc2 Friday\u8217\'20\'19s demonstration is understood to have been sparked by a broken fax machine, out of commission for several days \u8211\'20\'13 which many detainees were relying on to lodge their appeals.\par \par \uc2 The protesters decided to suspend their hunger strike over the weekend after Home Office officials agreed to meet a delegation of detainees, but it could be resumed if their concerns are not met.\par \par \uc2 One detainee told The Independent: \u8220\'20\'1CIf we are stuck in a detention centre without a working fax machine or internet access, how can we be expected to get the necessary proof needed to challenge decisions?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 An HM Inspectorate of Prisons report this year revealed that an 84-year-old dementia sufferer, Alois Dvorzac, had spent almost three weeks in the facility before he was taken, handcuffed, to hospital, where he later died.\par \par \uc2 A Home Office spokesman said: \u8220\'20\'1CDetention remains an essential element in protecting the UK\u8217\'20\'19s borders and maintaining an effective \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  control. Detention is only used sparingly and for the shortest period necessary.\u8221\'20\'1D GEO Group, the centre\u8217\'20\'19s operator, declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for GEO Group, the centre\u8217\'20\'19s operator, said:\u160\'00\'A0"A short and entirely passive protest took place at Harmondsworth IRC, involving between 30 and 40 detainees, over their concerns relating to their \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  status.\u160\'00\'A0 They missed one meal."\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140504ea54001up\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 JUSTICE AT LAST FOR PHILIP?\b0\par\par\uc2 Christopher Wilson   \par \uc2 1,522 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 May 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Express\par \uc2 THEEXP\par \uc2 1; National\par 22,23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Express Newspapers   \par \par \uc2 The arrest of Gerry Adams was the result of taped interviews with IRA members held by a US college. Could this archive also hold vital clues about the murder of a Daily Express reporter in the \uc2 Harrods\uc2  bomb outrage and bring\par \par \uc2 WHATEVER the fallout from this weekend's detention of Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams it has brought hope to the many people on mainland Britain, and in Ulster too, who never thought they would see justice for the victims of IRA atrocities.\par \par \uc2 The law states clearly that Mr Adams, interviewed for four days over the torture, abduction and murder of Jean McConville is innocent until proven guilty \u8211\'20\'13 and yesterday he was released without charge. But questions about the unaccountable deaths and torturings perpetrated by the IRA will now be answered. It may take time but the truth will out.\par \par \uc2 One of those deaths was that of Philip Geddes, a Daily Express reporter. Philip died, aged 24, in the IRA bomb attack on \uc2 Harrods\uc2 , the Knightsbridge department store, on December 17, 1983. He had been shopping for Christmas presents and, warned there was a security alert, hastened to the heart of the story. The IRA's bomb killed him instantly. He was just a reporter doing his job.\par \par \uc2 Others died that day, many more were injured and even now they and their families bear the burden of that ferocious attack. They in turn are a mere fraction of the other deaths, maimings and injuries perpetrated on innocent citizens by the IRA.\par \par \uc2 As one closely connected to this IRA murder I can speak with confi\u8211\'20\'13dence of the feelings which were triggered by Mr Adams' arrest. Hope, fear, anger and remorse will have crowded the minds of those connected with Warrington, Hyde Park, Enniskillen, Omagh, Chelsea. Each will think of their loved ones. Each will pray that at last justice may be done and the culprits \u8211\'20\'13 so many of whom slipped into the shadows to live a peaceful and carefree life today \u8211\'20\'13 may finally be apprehended.\par \par \uc2 I recall the days I spent sharing an office, and sharing a pint, with Philip. We were young, we were having fun, we were going to live for ever. Journalism was the best job in the world.\par \par \uc2 I wasn't kith and kin, just a work colleague, yet the day he never came back to the office has haunted me for 30 years. How much worse must it be for the relatives and dependents of those whose innocent lives were snatched away.\par \par \uc2 For the information which led to Mr Adams's arrest contains a treasure trove of other names, other atrocities, all of which will sooner or later come to light.\par \par \uc2 It is a fearful, also a liberating moment but too late for Philip's family to share \u8211\'20\'13 his father died of a broken heart, friends say, and his mother retreated into the shadows. They have all gone.\par \par \uc2 Philip was the only child of a Polish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  tailor and his English wife. The early years of his life were spent in the tiny flat they occupied at the top of a building in Barrow\u8211\'20\'13in\u8211\'20\'13Furness, Cumbria, which also contained a tailoring workroom and shop.\par \par \uc2 Philip's father Michael came from a small village near the Russian border. He joined the Polish army at the outbreak of the Second World War and was captured by the Germans, but managed to escape and make his way to England with the help of the Resistance.\par \par \uc2 Philip's father changed his name from Gedshkia to Geddes and determinedly settled into the life and community of Barrow, a popular figure who worked all hours to make his tiny business succeed. After primary school Philip won a place at the local Barrow Grammar School for boys and, such was his brilliance, he landed a place at \uc2 Oxford University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 From there it was a short step to Fleet Street, first as a reporter on the London Evening Standard, later on the Daily Express. As a reporter he was fearless, inventive, and ambitious while retaining a sympathetic streak and the ability to take a joke. While others chose smart London stores for their clothes, he wore with pride the suits his tailor father made for him.\par \par \uc2 FOR one so young Philip generated an extraordinary amount of affection and his death cast a long shadow over many lives. Only last week prior to Mr Adams' arrest emails were circulating which contained memories of the man who died 31 years ago.\par \par \uc2 Channel 4's political correspondent Michael Crick, an Oxford contemporary, recalled: "He always struck me as such a gentle, decent, intelligent person with a good sense of humour and mischief. He would have gone on to great success as a big\u8211\'20\'13name journalist."\par \par \uc2 Chris Blackhurst, former editor of The Independent, was a year behind Philip at Barrow Grammar and counted himself a friend: "He was clever, funny, smart \u8211\'20\'13 and very kind. Extremely well\u8211\'20\'13read and erudite. When Philip died his parents never recovered."\par \par \uc2 Peter Freeman, one of Philip's early employers, said: "He worked hard, played hard and had a rare ability to communicate joie de vivre and a sense of fun."\par \par \uc2 He is remembered too with immense pride by many colleagues from his days on the Daily Express. They contributed generously to a memorial set up in Philip's name which drew together the two great loves of his life \u8211\'20\'13 journalism and Oxford \u8211\'20\'13 and helped created the Geddes Awards, which to this day are competed for each year by young replicas of that swashbuckling reporter, all hoping to make their way in the world of journalism.\par \par \uc2 Each year a lecture in Philip's name \u8211\'20\'13 given by leading journalists such as Jeremy Paxman and Jon Snow \u8211\'20\'13 is delivered at \uc2 Oxford University\uc2  while over at \uc2 Harrods\uc2  every Christmas a vigil is held to commemorate not just Philip but the many others who were involved in that atrocity.\par \par \uc2 Last December, the 30th anniversary of the bombing, the traffic in Knightsbridge came to a halt as a minute's silence was held in memory of the three police officers and three members of the public who died, and the 90 who were injured.\par \par \uc2 More than 300 people turned out to attend in a scene that is repeated all over the land where the IRA left their bloody mark. Philip was just one \u8211\'20\'13 there have been so many more. But what gives hope to those touched by death and despair is the evidence which brought Mr Adams to Antrim police station last Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 THE Boston College oral history project, which involved interviewing 26 IRA members and 20 members of the opposing UVF (\uc2 Ulster Volunteer Force\uc2 ), started out as a way of writing an accurate history of The Troubles through spoken evidence from those who participated in the violence.\par \par \uc2 What the American academics involved failed to realise, perhaps, was that many crimes remain unsolved \u8211\'20\'13 and while their perpetrators remain alive they are subject to British law, which requires their arrest and conviction.\par \par \uc2 US and British authorities last year won a court battle against the Massachusetts college to obtain interviews from the oral history archive. They said the records were needed to investigate the 1972 killing of a widowed mother by the IRA. It is as a result of this action that Mr Adams was detained last week.\par \par \uc2 So far the US authorities are rejecting the idea that further extracts should be made available to the British authorities. But sooner or later it will become a human rights issue for the victims of the IRA and the truth will out. It behoves the \uc2 British Government\uc2  to be seen to be pursuing the opening up of the Boston College archive and in the coming days Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  will inevitably find himself closely questioned in the House of Commons as to his intentions.\par \par \uc2 For Philip and for his family justice will come \u8211\'20\'13 if it comes \u8211\'20\'13 too late. I last saw his mother three years ago in Barrow\u8211\'20\'13in\u8211\'20\'13Furness as we once again commemorated her son but by now she was a silent figure who had retreated into the shadows. She has since died.\par \par \uc2 For Michael, the soldier\u8211\'20\'13tailor who made a new life in Britain to escape the atrocities of the Russian military, the last word must come from Helen Haddon, Philip's closest childhood friend: "As the weeks and months passed Michael always seemed to be seated in the bay window of his house listening to Philip's voice on a dictaphone.\par \par \uc2 "Every time I called there he played it to me \u8211\'20\'13 telling me it was his son's voice and 'they killed him'.\par \par \uc2 "Michael never recovered from the shock of Philip's death. He died six and half years later and joined his son in his grave, ironically looking out over the Irish Sea, facing towards the island whose conflict had cost Philip his life."\par \par \uc2 Chris Blackhurst says simply: "Philip's dad died of a broken heart."\par \par \uc2 In the months before his death Michael Geddes wrote to Gerry Adams asking who had killed his son. He never received a reply.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140505ea550003q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

JOAN SMITH By email THE story that Peaches had taken heroin, and it could have led her death \u8212\'20\'14 leaving her tiny children without a mother \u8212\'20\'14 is as tragic as Kate McCann revealing she can't rest until she knows what has happened to her missing daughter Madeleine.\par \par \uc2 Both stories show in life bad things sadly do happen.\par \par \uc2 GARY TUTTON By email IT'S so sad to learn that heroin is likely to have played a part in Peaches' death.\par \par \uc2 What makes it more tragic is Peaches was a mother to two young children who she doted a week told crime is now told that being recorded.\par \par \uc2 on.\par \par \uc2 What about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , and so on?

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Our hypersensitivity about certain words is often silly - but it suggests the veneer of social tolerance is still very thin\par \par \uc2 There was a creepy fascination in seeing on screen the man behind the many letters: Demetri Marchessini. The retired businessman was on Channel 4 News as the "sixth biggest donor" to Ukip. Only ten thousand quid, but an irresistible chance for Michael Crick to sound shocked as Mr M reiterated his malign views on women, gays and slavery.\par \par \uc2 Women should be banned from wearing trousers because trousers do not "excite" men; rape in marriage is impossible because the woman signed up. As for homosexual love, it's impossible because even when men are partners they are just "roommates" who cruise for a dozen tricks a night. Oh, and slaves had a better life in the plantations than in Africa. Mr Crick elicited these views from the poor old loon, and was further rewarded by provoking from Neil Hamilton the defence that they were not party policy because "everyone knows that Christine wears the trousers in our house".\par \par \uc2 Many of us in media have been long familiar with the Marchessini letterhead. This year he even took a quarter-page ad in The Daily Telegraph to condemn me, following it with a demand for a public debate. A mild refusal provoked an invitation to lunch (no!) and a box of chocolates delivered to the BBC (the little ladies may dislike compulsory skirts and rape, bless 'em, but can be mollified with cocoa-butter). We offered them to the nearest gay colleagues. It's not only journalists: one theatre director was so impressed with his many Marchessini letters that he became convinced it was a Rupert Everett hoax and replied joyfully claiming he'd rumbled him.\par \par \uc2 That this elderly, angry, affluent man should be attracted to Ukip was inevitable. As flies to a dungheap it draws people with confused resentments about a world they fear is leaving them behind. Some are genuinely, dangerously racist: various Ukip candidates have been outed telling Lenny Henry to go to a "black" country, calling Muslims "devils' kids", etc. Less malevolent idiocies make spot-the-nutter a sport: calling women "sluts" for poor fridge hygiene, thinking gay marriage causes floods. That selfappointed verbal outlaws should crowd to Ukip as candidates, donors and creators of nasty slogans is Mr Farage's problem, and he has not dealt with it well. It has made even reasonable Euroscepticism and worries about mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  equate in many minds with embarrassing xenophobia and malicious narrowmindedness.\par \par \uc2 But reflecting on the extremes, I found my eye sliding sideways to the Jeremy Clarkson affair and a more general quirk of human behaviour. Clarkson is not, I suppose, a racist.\par \par \uc2 But an unbroadcast "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe" clip caused demands that the BBC sack him, because in slurring he might have seemed to use the N-word that used to be in the rhyme. Harriet Harman \u8212\'20\'14 never knowingly under-pompous \u8212\'20\'14 says "someone who uses the N-word in whatever context, in public or in private, has no place on the BBC". Any context, even historical and linguistic? Any private place? Come on \u8212\'20\'14 it's nasty, but it's not the Word of Power which unmakes the cosmos.\par \par \uc2 Fifty years ago horses and labradors bore the name and sofas were advertised as "n*****-brown". Many good people were unaware of its origins as a belittling insult associated with unforgivable persecution. As understanding grew it was outlawed, together with other markers of unjustifiable scorn: poof, taffy, left-footer, crip, pleb, yid \u8212\'20\'14 painful even to type them. Almost the only unthinking insult to someone's origins you can get away with now is "toff".\par \par \uc2 But when words or ideas become unsayable by decent people, they can develop a perverse magnetism. In private, between close associates who would never hurt a fly or join Ukip, mild xenophobic or homophobic asides become jokes. Oh yes they do. Especially among unimaginative middle-aged people. It's a mixture of defiance and nostalgia, possibly laced with a mischievous pleasure in imagining how it would upset Harriet Harman. And though we cannot know, it is easy to suspect that Clarkson was showing off to his crew the retro-laddish insouciance that is both his nature and his job, doing that mumbled take with an aren't-I-naughty giggle. It is not unimaginable that somewhere in his head he was being "free" and "brave". Just as when he insulted Mexicans or said "slope" in Burma.\par \par \uc2 Forbidden words give some people a guilty thrill, like cycling no-hands or flipping a V-sign to a policeman's back. By the same token \u8212\'20\'14 without suggesting that it actually happened \u8212\'20\'14 it is not impossible to imagine a stressed MP snarling "pleb" at an obstructive policeman. And regretting it.\par \par \uc2 It is not admirable but it is a common folly, an unfortunate relief of impotent stress. Go a bit deeper and you start to air private theories about lady-trousers and make lying, stupid generalisations about minorities. Silly, pitiable, not quite evil. The really interesting thing is how much it panics the rest of us, even from some no-hope candidate, powerless nutter or showbiz maverick. Marchessini's donation and Clarkson's b\u234\'00\'EAtise both made national news, even in a week when we jailed a lying judge and a sexually criminal celebrity PR and saw tragedies from Ukraine to Afghanistan. This outraged wincing feels as if the skin of social tolerance and understanding is still very thin: as if we fear that mere words from silly people will rip it open.\par \par \uc2 On balance, the hypersensitivity is probably a good thing. But it would be wonderful to think that in twenty years' time we'll be able to shudder and turn away, as if it was of no more significance than an obscene T-shirt slogan or a drunken burp in church.\par \par \uc2 Part of the thrill is in imagining how it will upset Harriet Harman\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140505ea550004j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business\par \b \uc2 Britain could become the worlds fourth largest economy within decades\b0\par\par\uc2 Roger Bootle   \par \uc2 1,074 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 May 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph\par \uc2 DT\par \uc2 1; National\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Viewpoint\par \par \uc2 Last week came news that, later this year, China is likely to overtake the US as the world's largest economy. There should not be any surprise in this \u8211\'20\'13 except that it is happening so quickly.\par \par \uc2 In fact, China will only pass the US on a particular measure of GDP that employs an artificial exchange rate called purchasing power parity (PPP). If you simply valued the two countries' GDPs at market exchange rates, the US would stay in front of China for many years to come. That said, arcane though it is, in many ways the PPP measure gives a more meaningful picture. Although the Chinese authorities are coy about admitting it, in this respect, China really is set soon to become the world's largest economy.\par \par \uc2 Arithmetically, this is the result of China recently growing faster than the US. And that is largely because of China being so far behind in development that it has greater scope for fast growth. But the fact that such a country can be top dog is a reflection of China's population being more than four times the size of America's. For a very long time after China has overtaken the US, American people will still, on average, be incomparably richer than their Chinese counterparts.\par \par \uc2 There is another important size issue closer to home which involves some of the same considerations. You might find the conclusions somewhat surprising. For most of my life the UK has been slipping down the rankings of countries rated by size of GDP. This does not mean that British people have been becoming worse off. Quite the opposite. But the rate of improvement has been slower than in many other countries. And the result is that the country has become less significant in economic terms.\par \par \uc2 Mind you, you can readily over\u8211\'20\'13do the declinism. Many people do not realise that on the market exchange rate measure, the UK is still the world's seventh largest economy, larger than India and Russia. On the PPP measure it is eighth.\par \par \uc2 Until recently, the widespread view was that, although this ranking might be surprisingly high, it was bound to slip inexorably over the next couple of decades.\par \par \uc2 In fact, the opposite may be true. The UK is growing at about the fastest rate of any economy in the G7. Later this year the UK will probably overtake France and Brazil, and in PPP terms it could soon overtake Russia. This would put it in fifth according to market exchange rates and sixth on a PPP basis. Now, there is an event in September which could radically change all this.\par \par \uc2 If Scotland votes for independence, the UK will immediately lose about 10pc of GDP and, accordingly, slip down the rankings quite a way. None of this would imply that people in the rest of the UK would be any worse off \u8211\'20\'13 at least not directly. Indeed, they may even be better off. But it would reduce the UK's weight in the world.\par \par \uc2 That aside, in the decades ahead the UK's ranking will be dominated, not just by matters of relative economic success, but also by demographics.\par \par \uc2 Because of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and a relatively high birth rate, the UK population is set to expand materially.\par \par \uc2 Now before the serried ranks of "Disgusteds from Tunbridge Wells" inundate me with abuse, let me make it clear that I am not saying that this is necessarily good. But what I am saying is that, if it happens, it will have major consequences that we need to take cognisance of.\par \par \uc2 Other things equal, it would increase the size of the UK's GDP. Again this does not necessarily imply a rise in per capita income relative to what would have happened anyway. Income could be increased, decreased or just left the same. But it does imply a larger economy. Many reputable judges believe that within a few decades the UK will have overtaken Germany as the country with the largest population in Europe. If we manage our affairs well and the UK's income per head at least stays level with Germany's, then this would imply that we would have the largest economy in Europe.\par \par \uc2 Where we would rank in the world, of course, would depend upon how other countries fared.\par \par \uc2 It is inconceivable that America and China would not occupy the top two slots, whichever was in pole position. And Japan would be bound to be number three. But thereafter there would be a good deal of uncertainty. The current fourth slot is occupied by Germany. If the UK overtook Germany then it is not inconceivable that we would be in the number four position.\par \par \uc2 For that to be true, though, the UK would have to continue to outgrow the countries that are currently snapping at its heels, and that may be difficult \u8211\'20\'13 although not impossible.\par \par \uc2 The key message is that the UK is not set to plummet down the rankings. I fully expect that during my children's lifetime it will become the largest economy in Europe and remain in the world's biggest 10 economies.\par \par \uc2 This should have a major impact on various aspects of public policy. Take our role in Europe, for instance. Could we contemplate an independent future outside the \uc2 European Union\uc2 ? A small and declining nation would find this more difficult than a large and growing one that is Europe's largest economy.\par \par \uc2 Should the UK continue to have a major role in global affairs, including retaining its permanent seat on the \uc2 UN Security Council\uc2 ? And, linked to this, should the UK remain a major military power? Our military planners and their political overseers seem to think that the next couple of decades are bound to be a continuation of the last couple, with persistent relative economic decline and therefore persistent decline in the affordability of, and the need for, strong defence forces.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes I think that the people who decide our defence strategy do not talk to the people who think about population trends. They need to. In 20 years time, the chances are that the UK will still be a large economy and a major force in world affairs.\par \par \uc2 Roger Bootle\uc2  is managing director of Capital Economics\par \par \uc2 'The UK's GDP ranking will be dominated, not just by its relative economic success, but also by demographics'\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140505ea5500010\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Brighton College becomes the first school in the UK to make history compulsory up to the age of 18 following claims too many children are missing out on a proper understanding of UK and world events\par \par \uc2 A leading private school is to make history compulsory up to the age of 18 amid fears pupils across the UK currently drop the subject earlier than in any other European country.\par \par \uc2 Brighton College in East Sussex is believed to be the first school in Britain to force all pupils to take history in the sixth-form.\par \par \uc2 Teenagers will be given an hour of the subject each week irrespective of whether they choose it as one of their A-level options, it was announced.\par \par \uc2 In the lower-sixth, pupils will be taught a broad chronology of British history starting with the Romans, Anglo-Saxons and Vikings and ending with the Victorians.\par \par \uc2 The upper-sixth will focus on world history and politics with a particular emphasis on the development of the UK, Russia, China and the United States on the international stage.\par \par \uc2 The announcement was made as Richard Cairns, the Brighton College headmaster, insisted it was a "disgrace" that pupils were currently allowed to drop the subject just three years into secondary education.\par \par \uc2 History is compulsory up the age of 14 in state schools.\par \par \uc2 The Government insists the overall number of pupils taking it at GCSE level in England has increased over the last decade.\par \par \uc2 But a recent survey by \uc2 The Historical Association\uc2  found that the number of schools barring some pupils from history had risen by around a quarter in the last 12 months and more than doubled over a two-year period because of concerns it was too hard.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cairns said: "History is not compulsory beyond the age of 14 in Britain. It is a disgrace that we are the only country in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  where this is the case.\par \par \uc2 "This also means that most history is studied in primary schools, usually in bite-size chunks with no obvious connections between topics.\par \par \uc2 "Children are introduced to the Egyptians, the Tudors and Victorian women. It is as if they are on a journey through the history and periodically they are blindfolded.\par \par \uc2 "They leave the world of ancient Rome to find themselves chained to the railings outside Buckingham Palace with Emily Pankhurst."\par \par \uc2 Brighton, which charges up to \u163\'00\'A320,400 a year for day pupils and \u163\'00\'A332,800 for boarders, said all pupils would take part in the history hour in the sixth-form. Classes will also be compulsory for those sitting separate A-levels in the subject.\par \par \uc2 The lower-sixth will focus on the "story of our land", Mr Cairns said, looking at the impact of the Romans, Anglo Saxons and Vikings, the significance of 1066, England's complex relations with Europe during the Middle Ages, the Magna Carta, Agincourt and the Spanish Armada.\par \par \uc2 In the upper-sixth, pupils will study world events, focusing on the UK, Russia, China and the US. Topics will include Russia's relations with other former Soviet states such as Ukraine and how the Boxer rebellion and Japanese invasion of China in the 30s shaped Chinese attitudes towards the West.\par \par \uc2 The plans will be announced at a conference staged at Brighton College this week, which will also feature an address from Michael Gove, the Education Secretary.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cairns said: "Education should be about providing young people with a cultural hinterland.\par \par \uc2 "They should be able to recognise Roman influences on our language and architecture, they should be able to distinguish different forms of architecture, understand the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on England over centuries not decades, and explain why Britain is so often both insular and global in outlook.\par \par \uc2 "And we owe it to young people to find time in the curriculum to explain major issues of global politics. They need to understand Russian sensitivities towards the Ukraine - and Ukrainian sensitivities towards Russia. They need to understand China's traditional suspicion of the west.\par \par \uc2 "They need to understand that China and India were global economic powers well before Britain was. They need to understand why Germany is so reluctant to intervene in world affairs while France and Britain strive to punch above their weight."\par \par \uc2 The Department for Education has said entries for GCSE history in England were actually at a 16-year high in 2013, with pupil numbers increasing by 17 per cent in 12 months.\par \par \uc2 It follows the introduction of the English Baccalaureate - a new league table measure that marks out pupils who gain good GCSE grades in a range of academic disciplines including history or geography.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman said it had "helped schools focus on core subjects including history".\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140505ea550005n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

POSE WITH BLACK MEMBERS!\b0\par\par\uc2 BY JAMES CHAPMAN    \par \uc2 587 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 May 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 NIGEL Farage is planning a series of appearances alongside black and ethnic minority candidates in an attempt to show Ukip is not a racist party.\par \par \uc2 As more damaging details emerged about his candidates, the Ukip leader conceded that too many 'idiots' had slipped through the party's vetting procedures.\par \par \uc2 He said he planned to 'fight back' against the negative impression they had made on voters.\par \par \uc2 Two days ago it emerged that a candidate in Stockport had been suspended after calling Islam 'evil' and saying Pakistan should be 'nuked'.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said yesterday the party had 'made mistakes' but should not be judged by a 'handful of people' saying 'idiotic things'.\par \par \uc2 He insisted : 'These people are not representative of Ukip at all. Not only am I adamant that we are a non-racist party, this week we are going to fight back against it.\par \par \uc2 'You will see our election address for the local elections this year and you will see a lot of black ethnic minority candidates who are proudly standing for Ukip. I am going to approach this differently in future.' Sources said Mr Farage was planning to appear alongside ethnic minority candidates, including Amjad Bashir, a business spokesman for the party, and Steven Woolfe, an economics spokesman who is of mixed race.\par \par \uc2 However, he risked further controversy as he ramped up his party's anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  message in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  election campaign - saying people should be worried if \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from Eastern European countries moved into their neighbourhoods.\par \par \uc2 'The question was, you know, "If a whole load of Romanian men moved in next door to you, would you be concerned about it?". Perhaps you would, yes,' Mr Farage told the BBC's \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  programme.\par \par \uc2 He insisted the Eastern enlargement of the EU had allowed criminals to enter Britain.\par \par \uc2 'We have opened up the doors to countries that have not recovered from communism and I'm afraid it has become a gateway for organised crime. Everybody knows that. No one dares say it.'\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Tory MP Jacob Rees Mogg repeated his call for an electoral pact between his party and Ukip, which would see each agreeing not to field candidates against each other in certain seats.\par \par \uc2 He told Sky's Murnaghan programme: 'It is tremendously important because actually Ukip and the Conservatives both want one big thing in common and that is a totally new relationship with the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .' He added that 'both our interests are allied in doing some sort of a deal'.\par \par \uc2 But Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Every party has to manage who their candidates are, I think it is pretty apparent by this stage that Ukip have not done that. They have a remarkable string of individual circumstances which add up something bigger which does lead you to have concerns about some of the people involved in that party.'\par \par \uc2 Ukip was mired in further controversy after it emerged candidate in Liverpool had suggested homosexuals are 'ten times more likely' than 'normal men' to be child abusers. Paul Forrest also said the 'end of Islam is coming' and that its followers who refuse to 'turn to Christ' will be 'gone'.\par \par \uc2 Former Labour minister David Lammy said the country was 'on the cusp of a serious bit of self-mutilation' in backing Ukip.\par \par \uc2 'Many of its candidates are saying terrible things about people of colour, terrible things about people who are gay,' he said.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140504ea550001q\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 TV&Showbiz\par \b \uc2 Stick to crime, Vera! The shag-pile carpet's a job for Kirstie Allsopp: CHRISTOPHER STEVENS REVIEWS LAST WEEKEND'S TV\b0\par\par\uc2 CHRISTOPHER STEVENS   \par \uc2 793 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 May 2014\par 02:30\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Half the programmes in the TV schedules these days seem to be about property.\par \par \uc2 We\u8217\'20\'19re so used to them that everything starts to look like some sort of renovation, makeover or house-hunting show.\par \par \uc2 If you\u8217\'20\'19re actually watching a crime drama, the effect can be disorientating.\par \par \uc2 The cameraman in Vera (ITV) made such a fuss about the decor at one murder suspect\u8217\'20\'19s luxury pad that it suddenly stopped being a detective story and turned into a house-and-home show instead.\par \par \uc2 Brenda Blethyn, as the police inspector in her floppy hat and tweed overcoat, looked like a bemused farmer asked to stand in for Kirstie Allsopp.\par \par \uc2 The picture panned over a vast, studded-leather sofa, that stretched round three sides of a room the size of a tennis court.\par \par \uc2 The walls were panelled in fake oak or clad in equally fake stone; the floor was ankle-deep in pale camel Axminster carpet, and there was a glass-topped coffee table bigger than most people\u8217\'20\'19s kitchens.\par \par \uc2 The camera kept swooping up to the ceiling, just so all these magnificently tacky furnishings could be fitted in one frame.\par \par \uc2 Blethyn, as DCI Vera Stanhope, asked a lot of questions in her clucky, mother hen way, but the one we were all waiting for never came: \u8216\'20\'18How much is this place on the market for, pet?\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 It would have been no surprise to discover during the adverts that Vera was produced in association with Allied Sofa Planet or some such retailer, one of those \u8216\'20\'18everything must go, sale ends Bank Holiday Monday\u8217\'20\'19 merchants.\par \par \uc2 There was plenty of other product placement. Over and over we were told that one of the suspects drove a \u8216\'20\'18Qashqai\u8217\'20\'19, which looks like a four-wheeled spelling mistake but is apparently a Japanese car.\par \par \uc2 Vera followed the \u8216\'20\'18Qashqai\u8217\'20\'19 around town, she looked on CCTV at the \u8216\'20\'18Qashqai\u8217\'20\'19 and then, in a real tongue-twister, she found the \u8216\'20\'18Qashqai car keys\u8217\'20\'19. Gone are the days of The Sweeney, when every car was just \u8216\'20\'18a motor\u8217\'20\'19 and that was that.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s a shame that Vera makes such blunders, because the plotting and the characters are among the best of current detective dramas. The pace is superb \u8212\'20\'14 this story, about a seafront killing in Whitby Bay, delivered the crime, a round-up of the suspects, some flirting in the autopsy room, a tense CID briefing, a funeral and the first arrest, all before the first advert break.\par \par \uc2 The usual stereotypes are wittily upended: the Glaswegian hardman on Vera\u8217\'20\'19s team is not corrupt or bulletproof, as he would be in any other crime series, but a dimwit who couldn\u8217\'20\'19t tie his shoelaces without dislocating a finger.\par \par \uc2 Like its sister series, BBC1\u8217\'20\'19s Shetland, Vera is based on a series of crime novels by Ann Cleeves. But unlike Shetland, this show has abandoned any pretentious attempt to be Britain\u8217\'20\'19s answer to Scandi-noir.\par \par \uc2 Vera used to investigate the strangest and most bloodcurdling killings \u8212\'20\'14 victims torched and thrown blazing into lakes, for instance.\par \par \uc2 FORMAT OF THE WEEK\par \par \uc2 Every year millions of telly addicts like me swear we will stay away from the World Snooker championships (BBC2) and every year it hypnotises us again.\par \par \uc2 The makers of frenetic dramas like Prey should take note \u8212\'20\'14 a motionless picture can be more thrilling than any car chase.\par \par \uc2 But she\u8217\'20\'19s given that up: her bodies now are more old-fashioned Agatha Christie than Swedish crimefighter Saga Noren. Last week, for instance, it was an old lady stabbed on the train, and yesterday brought a simple coshing.\par \par \uc2 If the director could only resist the temptation to sell us foreign cars and three-piece suites, Vera might start to look like a modern classic.\par \par \uc2 In The Flesh (BBC3) isn\u8217\'20\'19t likely to ditch its principles and sell out. It\u8217\'20\'19s as earnest as a sixth-form drama production, and the dialogue is just as cringe-worthy. Despite game performances from old troupers Ricky Tomlinson and Kenneth Cranham, this tale of zombies in a rural Lancashire town is preachy and derivative.\par \par \uc2 The undead stalking the streets are called \u8216\'20\'18the redeemed\u8217\'20\'19 \u8212\'20\'14 but they are a metaphor for every kind of minority group, from \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to HIV sufferers.\par \par \uc2 If you are not accustomed to the cliches of B-movies about the living dead, be warned: In The Flesh features explosions of gore and dismemberment, as well as endless drooling corpses shouting \u8216\'20\'18Rarrrgghhh!\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 But they\u8217\'20\'19ll grow up soon enough, and before you know it the undead will be presenting home improvement shows. How about A Tomb With A View, presented by Zombie Allsopp?\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140505ea55000b7\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Hundreds of detainees threaten hunger-strike\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kunal Dutta   \par \uc2 205 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 May 2014\par \uc2 i\par \uc2 IIND\par \uc2 1ST\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd.

Harmondsworth, near Heathrow airport in west London, holds 615 detainees and is run by the GEO Group. On Friday more than 100 detainees staged a demonstration, threatening to starve themselves amid growing anger over the Government's fasttrack asylum procedure which involves \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  officers making an initial decision within two weeks while an asylum seeker is in detention. Campaigners argue that it often leads to rushed and unfair decisions as applicants are left with insufficient time to gather evidence.\par \par \uc2 The demonstration is understood to have been sparked by a broken fax machine that many were relying on to mount their appeals.\par \par \uc2 Campaigners say that they opted to suspend their hunger strike over the weekend after they were told of a meeting between Home Office officials and detainees scheduled for Tuesday. A Home Office spokesperson said: "Detention remains an essential element in protecting the UK's borders and maintaining an effective \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  control."\par \par \uc2 Document IIND000020140505ea550004j\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 @ i Your View\b0\par\par\uc2 1,089 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 May 2014\par \uc2 i\par \uc2 IIND\par \uc2 1ST\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd.

I have a concern, however, that the Panorama programme and subsequent journalistic responses may generate even more damage.\par \par \uc2 The current publicity will give some urgency to what is already known to be desperately needed: sound staff training, recognised national standards, more thorough inspection than received now, fair pay rather than the abysmal wages now offered, but most of all a recognition that care staff do vitally important and difficult work. There will be no chance of recruiting good, conscientious staff with the care "industry" treated as anathema, as it is now. Twelve years ago my 86-year-old mother had two serious operations but went on to enjoy five more years of good-quality life. Not only did she have excellent medical and nursing care in two London hospitals, for which the whole family is grateful, but she had two stays in a high-quality care home.\par \par \uc2 She enjoyed those stays and made rapid recovery there. We should recognise the good practice that does exist and that many staff are dedicated and caring. MARIANNE LEDERMAN HITCHIN, HERTFORDSHIRE For all of the bad press about bad carers and homes, there are also good ones. My wife has Alzheimer's, and has been in a home since 2010. She is very happy, thanks to the wonderful staff. So there are good stories out there, write about them too.\par \par \uc2 BARNABY JOHNSON We all know how badly the elderly are treated in some "care homes". I have, for the last year, taken my mother into my home. She has dementia so I am well aware of the many problems care staff have to deal with.\par \par \uc2 However the answer to care for the elderly is simple. Instead of the state paying \u163\'00\'A3700 or more a week, offer the family half of this to enable them to give their parent the care they need. At present I am penalised for having my mother. I now have to pay full council tax. Before she came to me, Mum lived in sheltered accommodation costing the local authority over \u163\'00\'A3800 per week.\par \par \uc2 I am sure many people have sleepless nights worrying about their relatives but cannot afford to give up work to take care of them.\par \par \uc2 ANN CRAIG RAMSGATE, KENT Look carefully at Ukip policies Andrew Grice makes a good point about Ukip ("Cameron must not insult Ukip voters", 3 May). If you want to take on Ukip, insulting its supporters is not the way to go about it. If anything, it emboldens them.\par \par \uc2 At one point I thought I might end up voting for Ukip but I decided not to after thinking about their policies for a while. If people spent more time actually criticising the party's policies instead of making racism claims and character assassinations, it could influence many undecided voters.\par \par \uc2 Ukip's policies don't seem to have been scrutinised as much as they should, and the scrutiny they get tends to focus on the EU and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Their poor environment policies, such as their denial of man-made climate change and wrongly blaming green taxes for energy price rises, was the main thing which stopped me supporting them. But this is just one area of Ukip policy which doesn't get as much attention as it should. All of Ukip's policies need to be put under the spotlight. REECE FOWLER MIDDLESBROUGH Worse things than the N-word Most black people are not worried about the N-word, whether Jeremy Clarkson said it or not; there are bigger problems to deal with.\par \par \uc2 Racism is still strong. I am 61 and it still happens to me. Some people won't rent to blacks. We are searched more at the airport for drugs and guns. My children are now experiencing racism.\par \par \uc2 D SIMPSON Loss of the 'Lusitania' David Usborne perhaps lets his imagination do the writing when he writes of "trepidation in the hearts" of all aboard the Lusitania as it left New York the last time (The Great War in 100 Moments, 2 May).\par \par \uc2 My father-in-law, William Jones, was one of the ship's engineers and survived the sinking. Years later he told my late husband that its sinking by a U-boat came as a complete surprise. As to whether the atrocity hastened the USA's entry into the Great War, a further passage of two years before it did so suggests otherwise. DAPHNE JONES MILTON KEYNES Paxman bested In his eulogy of Jeremy Paxman, Simon Kelner (2 May) was wrong to claim that "only Russell Brand got the better of him".\par \par \uc2 In April 2010 Eurfyl ap Gwilym, economic adviser to Plaid Cymru, clearly got the better of Paxman on public expenditure figures, telling him "to do your homework".

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 News | 2015 ELECTION In the first of a five-part series about Britain's key political battlegrounds for next year's elections, Oliver Wright reports from Crawley in West Sussex\par \par \uc2 It is always dangerous forming conclusions on the basis of a small snapshot of opinion.\par \par \uc2 But when you speak to around two dozen people in three different locations and the vast majority - unprompted - say that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is the political issue they feel most strongly about, it is hard not to form some certainties. And when those people live in one of the more marginal constituencies you begin to understand why politicians of all parties are, in different ways, struggling to address the problem. Voters in Crawley - a new town built in the shadow of \uc2 Gatwick Airport\uc2  - are not racist. They just feel successive governments have got it wrong. Take Joan - a woman in her early sixties: "People round here can't get jobs; can't get housing and they're living on benefits because they can't do anything but," she says. "Then you've got loads of people coming over here because they think the streets are paved with gold."\par \par \uc2 Then there is Patsy whose son left for Australia because, she says, London was too expensive for him to get on the property ladder.\par \par \uc2 "Those people coming from the EU get houses. My children have never been able to get houses. I don't mind so much a few refugees because I hate to think of people really suffering in the world. But it's not right as it is."\par \par \uc2 If Ed Miliband is to walk into Downing Street next May he will almost certainly have to win in Crawley. It is a key swing constituency - Tory throughout the Eighties to 1997, Labour until 2010 and now again Conservative with a majority for the sitting MP Henry Smith of 5,928. Last time Ukip only got around 1,400 votes.\par \par \uc2 Where the Liberal Democrat vote goes next year is likely to be crucial. Last time they got 14 per cent of the vote - but the party has no presence on the local council and party headquarters could find nobody to talk about their campaign.\par \par \uc2 Labour's candidate is Chris Oxlade, a former local radio DJ who lost in 2010 after the sitting MP, Laura Moffatt, stood down. The party has made steady gains in the local borough council elections and could take control when voters go to the polls later this month.\par \par \uc2 If the swings of last year's council elections were reproduced in 2015 it would see the Tories winning just 31.1 per cent of the vote and Labour taking the seat with 40.7 per cent. And that is before factoring in Ukip.\par \par \uc2 Mr Oxley says the key to a Labour victory is getting the party's core vote out.\par \par \uc2 "If we get in it won't be on the back of Lib Dem votes - it will be on the back of voters returning to Labour."\par \par \uc2 As for \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , Mr Oxley says: "There is a concern from people we speak to on the doorstep. It's in the top five worries for people definitely. But Crawley has always had \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ... We've got the highest BME (black and minority ethnic) population of any new town.\par \par \uc2 Outside a school in Langley Green, which is a poorer part of town that should be a Labour stronghold, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was also the dominant issue.\par \par \uc2 Those parents meeting children were mainly first-generation \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  both from eastern Europe and further afield, many of whom spoke little English.\par \par \uc2 White parents outside the school gates were angry and resentful.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to sound racist, that's the thing," said Nikayla before admitting that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is the one thing that really riles her.\par \par \uc2 "I'm white English but really this should be a Muslim school because of all the Muslims here. It's not really an English school."\par \par \uc2 So how does Mr Smith address these concerns and prevent the Tory vote haemorrhaging to Ukip? "It would be wrong for any candidate to say \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is not an issue on the doorstep because it is," he says. "But I do think the overwhelming concern among voters is the economy. And here things are really improving.\par \par \uc2 He may well be right. But it is hard not to think that Ukip's current support will have to collapse pretty spectacularly not to increase a lot on their 2010 vote.\par \par \uc2 And when there are only a few thousand votes in the contest it is really too close to call.\par \par \uc2 The floating vote Crawley 2010 election results Henry Smith (Con) 21,264 Chris Oxlade (Lab) 15,336 John Vincent (Lib Dem) 6,844 Richard Trower (BNP) 1,672 Chris French (Ukip) 1,382 Phil Smith (Green) 598 How the ethnic make-up has changed since 2001 White - UK: 76,888 in 2011 (-8.7%) White - other European: 7,248 in 2011 (+166%) Asian Indian: 5,530 (+25%) Pakistani: 4,548 (+52%) Black African: 2,164 (+198%)\par \par \uc2 Document IIND000020140505ea550001h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 History is to become a compulsory subject up to the age of 18 at a leading independent school, to broaden pupils\u8217\'20\'19 cultural knowledge and address the \u8220\'20\'1Cdisgrace\u8221\'20\'1D of children dropping the subject at 14.\par \par \uc2 Brighton College claims to be the first school in Britain to make the subject mandatory for all sixth formers. They will spend an hour a week studying the history in addition to their chosen A levels, though they will not sit an exam in the subject.\par \par \uc2 In the first year of the sixth form, lessons will span Roman Britain to the 19th century, covering the Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Normans, England\u8217\'20\'19s relations with Europe during the Middle Ages and key events such as Magna Carta, the Battle of Agincourt and the Spanish Armada. In the upper sixth, lessons will cover international history and how it has shaped foreign policy, looking at the US, China and Russia.\par \par \uc2 Leading academics have campaigned for history to be a mandatory subject to 16. This was among the principal arguments made by Sir David Cannadine in a book published in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Michael Gove, the education secretary, resisted such calls in his review of the national curriculum, maintaining the current position whereby history must be taught until 14.\par \par \uc2 Instead he introduced incentives for schools to enter teenagers for GCSEs in either history or geography by changing school performance measures, which have boosted uptakes in both.\par \par \uc2 Richard Cairns, headmaster at Brighton College, said: \u8220\'20\'1CHistory is not compulsory beyond the age of 14 in Britain. It is a disgrace that we are the only country in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  where this is the case.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis also means that most history is studied in primary schools, usually in bite-size chunks with no obvious connections between topics. Children are introduced to the Egyptians, the Tudors and Victorian women. It is as if they are on a journey through the history and periodically they are blindfolded. They leave the world of ancient Rome to find themselves chained to the railings outside Buckingham Palace with Emily Pankhurst.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Pupils at Brighton College will still be able to drop history at 14 when they choose GCSE options. Around 65 per cent of its pupils take the subject at GCSE.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cairns added: \u8220\'20\'1CEducation should also be about providing young people with a cultural hinterland. They should be able to recognise Roman influences on our language and architecture, they should be able to distinguish different forms of architecture, understand the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on England over centuries not decades, and explain why Britain is so often both insular and global in outlook.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 England\u8217\'20\'19s system of allowing teenagers to choose three or four subjects at A level is often criticised as one of the narrowest post-16 curriculums in the world. Many countries require children to study maths, their own language, history or a foreign language, or give teenagers a wider choice.\par \par \uc2 Under Mr Gove\u8217\'20\'19s A-level reforms, many schools may drop AS levels and enter sixth formers for only three full A levels although a new post-16 maths qualification is being introduced.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140504ea55001zj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Ukip leader says Britain has opened doors to countries that 'have not recovered from communism'\par \par \uc2 The enlargement of the EU to include former Warsaw Pact countries such as Romania has created a "gateway for organised crime", the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, has said.\par \par \uc2 As more damaging details emerged about the views of Ukip candidates, Farage admitted his party had made mistakes in its selection of candidates. He said Ukip would attempt to change perceptions this week when it publishes its election addresses for the local election, which feature black and minority ethnic candidates.\par \par \uc2 But Farage said the presence of Romanians in Britain was posing a threat to Britain when he warned of an explosion in organised crime. Expanding on his answer in a Guardian interview last month, when he spoke of how discomforting it would be to live next door to Romanians, Farage told the \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show on BBC1: "We have opened up the doors to countries that have not recovered from communism and I'm afraid it has become a gateway for organised crime. Everybody knows that. No one dares say it."\par \par \uc2 The remarks appeared to be aimed at Romania and Bulgaria, two former Warsaw Pact countries, which joined the EU in 2007. A further eight former Warsaw Pact countries, led by Poland, joined the EU in 2004. Farage is concerned about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from the so-called "A8" but his remarks appeared to be aimed at Romania and Bulgaria because they are less developed economically.\par \par \uc2 Farage insisted his party was not racist after the Sunday Times reported that a candidate in Stockport had resigned after calling Islam "evil". The Ukip leader said: "We have made mistakes. But these people are not representative of Ukip at all. Not only am I adamant that we are a non-racist party, this week we are going to fight back against it. You will see our election address for the local elections this year and you will see a lot of black ethnic minority candidates who are proudly standing for Ukip. I am going to approach this differently in future."\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140504ea550005o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Birju Mishra was the chosen one. The elder son of a Delhi couple who had moved to New York at the end of the 1970s, he was diligent and dutiful, studied hard, bagged a place at an elite school. But he wasn't just another Asian swot or nerdy \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 . He liked sport. He even had a girlfriend (a Korean one at that). His promise and potential matched those of America itself. His success appeared to prove that the American Dream was no chimera. Then one day he dived into a swimming pool and hit his head. At once, his glistening future was over.\par \par \uc2 Akhil Sharma's Family Life is a delicate and often moving work of palliative poetics, based on a calamity that befell his own brother, that documents the impact of Birju's accident on the people around him. As he lies stricken and unable to communicate, his younger brother Ajay, through whose eyes the novel is narrated, prays so hard his gums hurt, is sent out of class by insensitive schoolteachers when he starts crying, concocts elaborate stories about Birju's brilliance. His father takes to drink.\par \par \uc2 Anyone who has ever had the misfortune to spend long stretches in hospital waiting - possibly in vain - for a loved one to recover, or had to deal with the high costs and frustrations of finding a nursing home for those they cherish, will recognise and perhaps even take solace from Sharma's account of how the Mishras coped after their son's accident. There is both patience and forensic rigour in the way Sharma itemises Birju's convulsions, droolings, seizures, stiffenings, sweating, vomiting.\par \par \uc2 There's also understated comedy in those sections where Birju becomes a kind of pilgrimage site for the growing south Asian population. Descending upon the Mishra household are travel agents, petroleum engineers and sweetshop owners who think they can heal the young man; pious nationalists who celebrate Mrs Mishra's care for her son as an example of how Asians are as devoted and family-oriented as Americans are selfish; holy men and hucksters. This isn't all bad - the Mishras get company and free dinners - but it also means they're barely one step up from being a freak show. The outsiders are "like tourists visiting a temple to see an exorcism".\par \par \uc2 It's been 14 years since the publication of An Obedient Father, Sharma's only other novel. Family Life has been whittled down from more than 7,000 pages: he has chiselled and scraped his prose rigorously, shaving all traces of ostentation or finery to leave it as clean and functional as a new hospital ward.\par \par \uc2 Another, perhaps more adventurous writer would have aspired to render the chaos and volatility in the Mishra family's lives in more vagrant language and syntax. A more ruthless editor would have urged him to cut the chapter in which Ajay reflects rather ponderously on the art of writing. ("As I kept reading Hemingway, who seemed to so value suffering in silence, I began to see my family's pain as belonging in a story.")\par \par \uc2 The longer Family Life goes on the more it resembles a coming-of-age story with Ajay getting into scraps at school, learning the art of wooing young women, and coming to see his brave, broken-hearted parents in a new light.\par \par \uc2 A lot of drama, perhaps too much, gets compressed into a short space. But the novel is mostly involving, far removed from the sobby cliches of the misery memoir, and, let's hope, a taster for future fictions in which Sharma adroitly continues puncturing the myth of south Asians in America being a unified and model minority.\par \par \uc2 To buy Family Life for pounds 11.99 with free UK p&p call 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Akhil Sharma has finely chiselled his prose in Family Life, discarding all ostentation.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140504ea540003s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

An Italian Jew named Sion Segre Amar had been arrested while smuggling anti-Black Shirt propaganda into Switzerland from Turin. He belonged to Italy's pro-British Justice and Liberty movement made up of disaffected Catholics, Jews, army stragglers and a handful of frustrated adventurers. Members were known as giellisti after the movement's initials "G" and "L" (for Giustizia e Liberta). A total of 17 giellisti were held in Turin for questioning. Among them was the painter and doctor Carlo Levi, later famous as the author of Christ Stopped at Eboli\par \par \uc2 Only three giellisti were tried and convicted, but the 1934 subversion plot threatened to weaken and divide Italian Jewry at a time when it faced the common threat of Hitler. Dreadfully, a pro-Fascist Italian Jew had betrayed the conspirators: in the Italian resistance where the risk of betrayal was constant, a sense of trust and fellowship was vital. After Hitler occupied northern Italy in November 1943, fortunately, the political movement against Mussolini evolved into an organised mass of factory workers, peasants and intellectuals. Italians now had to take sides for or against Germany.\par \par \uc2 Target: Italy, by the Oxford-based historian Roderick Bailey, chronicles the \uc2 British government\uc2 's role in fomenting anti-Fascist activity in occupied Italy between 1940-1943. Agents were trained in counter-subversion and behind-the-lines sabotage by Britain's Special Operations Executive. Recruits were taken from among Italian prisoners of war captured in Egypt and Libya, and from Italian \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  communities in Britain and the United States.\par \par \uc2 Britain had at first endorsed Mussolini and the cult of ducismo. Throughout the early 1930s the dictator was feted by most of the British press and was on good terms with King George V. Relations deteriorated after Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935 and Britain imposed unexpectedly harsh sanctions. Mussolini declared war on Britain in June 1940.\par \par \uc2 The SOE made little headway at first, says Bailey. Justice and Liberty had been forced to go underground in 1937 when its founder members, Carlo and Nello Rosselli, were found murdered at a roadside in Normandy. Mussolini's secret police, OVRA, had hunted the brothers down in their French exile and slit their throats. However, Italy's surviving giellisti had regrouped in 1942 as the Action Party, named after the Risorgimento patriot Giuseppe Mazzini's Partito d'Azione. With the help of the SOE, they took up arms against the Nazi intruder and Italian fanatics in German uniform.\par \par \uc2 According to Bailey, only a handful of SOE recruits were thrill-seekers or mercenaries. Fortunato Picchi, a 43-year-old former head waiter at London's Savoy hotel, was motivated by a sense of duty to the allied cause. Issued with British battledress and identity discs, in February 1941 he was parachuted into the Naples area with 34 other SOE operatives. Caught up in the Nazi-Fascist dragnets, Picchi was captured and eventually executed while strapped to a chair with his back turned to the firing squad: the Fascist way of disposing with "traitors". His mission to blow up an aqueduct outside Naples had failed.\par \par \uc2 In Britain, nevertheless, Picchi was feted as a hero ("SAVOY'S PICCHI DIES FOR US", hurrahed the Daily Express). The War Office even planned to make a film about him. He was one of an estimated 18,000 Italians resident in Britain at the time. Not a few of them were Jews on the run from the Fascist antisemitic laws of 1938 and wished only for Fascist Italy's demise. Mussolini's cosh gangs conspired to deport more than 6,800 Italian Jews to Auschwitz and other Nazi death camps. Mussolini made no attempt to justify the outrage; Hitler, at least, was lethally committed to his ideology.\par \par \uc2 Giacomino Sarfatti, typically for an anti-Fascist Italian Jew, viewed the Resistance as a "second Risorgimento" which, like the first Risorgimento prior to Italian unification in 1861, sought to rid Italy of a foreign power. Sarfatti was studying agriculture at Reading University when the SOE found him and trained him as a wireless operator. In December 1942 he was dropped into enemy-occupied Lombardy, where he began to transmit and decode messages and establish links with giellisti and other anti-axis partisans. He survived the war to become Professor of Botany at the University of Siena.\par \par \uc2 How much the SOE succeeded in fostering resistance in wartime Italy is debatable. Italian partisans liberated Genoa and other northern cities without recourse to the SOE or other allied help. What is certain is that the SOE provided a symbolic hope and moral support to Italian patriots in their struggle.\par \par \uc2 Roderick Bailey was appointed by David Cameron in 2012 to write this "official" history. Drawing on long-classified documents, he amplifies on David Stafford's earlier account of Italy and the SOE, Mission Accomplished, to produce a readable, fast-paced narrative.\par \par \uc2 To buy Target: Italy for pounds 15.39 with free UK p&p call 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Mussolini, May 1938: the dictator was once feted by the British press but relations worsened when Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935.

Jenna Sauers meets them\b0\par\par\uc2 Jenna Sauers   \par \uc2 2,238 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.

All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 "Your body is your best friend in the entire world," says Ilona Royce Smithkin, a flame-haired nonagenarian fashion icon and one of the stars of the new film Advanced Style. Royce Smithkin has many opinions about clothes - and many more about life. "I think people expect too much of themselves, and that's not for happy-making," she explains from her tiny West Village walk-up. "In trying to be perfect you miss half of your life."\par \par \uc2 The documentary in which Royce Smithkin appears is the brainchild of photographer Ari Seth Cohen and filmmaker Lina Plioplyte. San Diego-raised Cohen founded the blog Advanced Style in August 2008, and it quickly became a sensation for showcasing one of fashion's most unjustly overlooked demographics: women over 60. The blog spawned numerous other projects - including a 2012 coffee-table book, now in its seventh print run - and garnered praise from sources as diverse as the New Yorker and Vogue Italia, which called Advanced Style less a street-style blog than\par \par \uc2 "a sociological treatise" on ageing and identity.\par \par \uc2 Marc Jacobs\uc2  has said he was inspired by the blog and its subjects to design his AW12 collection (never mind that he cast runway models as young as 14 to show it). Barneys' \uc2 Simon Doonan\uc2 , in the documentary, calls Cohen's photography "punk and subversive". Reading Advanced Style, one gets the sense that the women featured see dress, as one subject puts it, as a "supportive act" - that they are, through personal style, demanding to be seen in a society that too often looks past them.\par \par \uc2 The Advanced Style film follows seven stylish older New York women who are frequent subjects of Cohen's blog. Filming began in 2008, and the feature was financed primarily via a 2012 Kickstarter campaign that raised $55,441. "I pulled a lot of favours to bring the film in on budget," laughs Plioplyte. The project started after she shot short video portraits of Cohen's subjects. "People were going crazy for them on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  - we were getting, you know, 50,000 views," she says. "Suddenly it seemed like the story was much, much bigger than just a video or two."\par \par \uc2 When first approached, almost all of the women who became Cohen's subjects expressed some scepticism about the blogger and his project. Retired dancer Jacquie Murdock, who recalls that she was wearing a Courreges jacket when Cohen came up to her, warned him sternly: "I'm a professional - I could sue you if you use my image without\par \par \uc2 my permission." Cohen says Joyce Carpati, now a friend and a subject of the documentary, also "took a while to convince".\par \par \uc2 "Some women say yes, and some women say no. And that's just how it is," he says. "If they're 83 years old and they're out on the street, it's because they have somewhere to be." It's the "flat-out no's" who still haunt him. "I remember one lady on Lexington in her 60s - she had old movie-star red hair, gold belt, leopard-print jacket. . ." he trails off. Women who say no are worried about the use of their image, worried that the blog will patronise them - or they simply don't have the time or inclination to pose. One woman in her 60s who works in fashion has always turned Cohen down because she finds the project "othering" to older women.\par \par \uc2 "What I present on my blog is very positive," says Cohen, who is 32. "I don't really show the negative aspects of ageing, because that's already in the media. But in making the movie we definitely wanted to show the struggles." He becomes quiet. "It's something that we usually don't have to think about when we're young - losing friends."\par \par \uc2 Cohen, a bespectacled graduate of the \uc2 University of Washington\uc2 , has had an interest in the elderly since childhood. He says if he hadn't done Advanced Style he'd be working in a nursing home, and his grandmothers, Bluma and Helen, had a big impact on his early life. He describes himself as "in awe of" Bluma, a retired librarian, as a kid. "We would watch old movies together and I would try on my grandfather's clothes and play in her cupboards," he says. Helen, meanwhile, dressed every day in Escada suits and gold jewellery. "We used to go to Los Angeles and people would ask if she was a movie star."\par \par \uc2 "My whole life has changed since I met Ari," says Royce Smithkin, a mostly retired artist and art teacher. The 94-year-old, who walks with a stoop and makes false eyelashes out of her own orange-dyed hair, was recently a face of Karen Walker eyewear and starred in an online video for Coach. (Both ads were shot by Cohen.) "Whatever he asks me, it's so much fun." She launches into song: "How could\par \par \uc2 a lady refuse?"\par \par \uc2 Royce Smithkin - who painted the portrait of Ayn Rand that to this day adorns many editions of the author's novels - says her first awareness of style came from her mother. Born in Poland in 1920, she grew up in Berlin before the family emigrated to the US in 1938. "My childhood wasn't a very happy one," she says. "It was a bad time. But I remember my mother always looked very nicely dressed. I was always proud of her when she brought me to school."\par \par \uc2 IN ANOTHER WAR-TORN European country, a then-16-year-old Joyce Carpati had a similar first encounter with style. She was studying opera in Milan just after the Second World War. "You still saw bullet holes in the buildings, and people really did not have an easy time," she recalls. "And yet in the afternoon they would come out dressed magnificently. Magnificently. I was there in the autumn and I saw a woman in a tweed suit and laced suede Oxfords. . . I thought: I love that!" She promptly acquired a tweed suit and a pair of "intelligent shoes" for herself. "And when I wore it, heads did turn," she laughs. Carpati went on to become the first female ad sales manager at Hearst publications, where she worked for Good Housekeeping and Cosmopolitan under the legendary editor Helen Gurley Brown.\par \par \uc2 Although the film showcases its subjects' diversity - the women have very different lifestyles, they come from different ethnic and class backgrounds, and their personal styles range from colourful and anarchic to sedate and classic - common themes emerge across the seven stories. Financial struggles. Family relationships. Dealing with ageing and loss. One of the subjects - the 95-year-old style icon Zelda Kaplan - died during production. Kaplan fainted in the front row of the Joanna Mastroianni show at New York fashion week and was rushed to hospital. She never regained consciousness. Another subject, Lynn Dell Cohen (no relation to Ari), was hospitalised after a ruptured gallbladder.\par \par \uc2 "I almost died," says the 81-year-old Lynn Dell. "I was on the critical list for six weeks." One scene shows her after three operations, fully made up and wearing a black off-the-shoulder top. Cohen runs a boutique called Off Broadway on Manhattan's Upper West Side; she favours turbans and bib-sized necklaces. The other patients hardly share her priorities. "Some woman at physical therapy said to me: 'Oh, is this a fashion show?'" Lynn Dell says, wrinkling her nose. "I said: 'Yes, it is!'"\par \par \uc2 "As far back as when I was three years old I remember playing with materials," says Debra Rapoport, 68, another of the film's subjects. "For me, everything was a hat."\par \par \uc2 Rapoport, whose snowy pixie cut is dip-dyed pink and who has been a face of K-Mart, was influenced by her grandmother's Depression-era thrift - she outfitted the household in recycled fabrics, sparking Rapoport's own interest in the reuse of materials. These days Rapoport is an artist and milliner who says she is inspired by the "layers" of the city - "by concrete and garbage and residue and recycling".\par \par \uc2 Jacquie Murdock, 83, was born at the height of the Depression to Jamaican \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . In the 1930s and 40s, there were two gears around which Harlem style turned: church and nightlife. The teenage Murdock's parents dressed for the former, while she dressed for the latter. "People in Harlem were very fashionable," she recalls. "I don't care what kind of menial job they had, they got dressed up on Friday and Saturday nights when they got paid, and they went to the ballrooms."\par \par \uc2 Murdock's dance costumes were fashioned from anything and everything - including, once, her teacher's mother's curtains. At 17, Norma the "Queen of Swing" Miller hired Murdock to dance at the Apollo Theatre. "I was in heaven," she says. "To go into the Apollo, to stand behind that curtain, behind that Count Basie Orchestra. When that music came up from the floor through your feet all through your body - I still remember the volume of the horns - it was wonderful."\par \par \uc2 Cohen founded his blog to help correct what he sees as a fundamental injustice of American culture: the invisibility of older people, particularly women over 60. Older women are largely unseen in the media, and - as Tina Fey once put it - any woman "who keeps talking even after no one wants to fuck her any more" is likely to be deemed crazy. "People ask: 'Why do you mostly photograph women?' Well, I don't think men have those same challenges," says Cohen. "I think a lot of it's fear. Fear of death. Fear of getting older."\par \par \uc2 "As a group I think we have a heck of a lot to offer," says Carpati, a grandmother of two who wears her grey hair in a braid. "I hope I'm not being too strong. I really feel that way." Lynn Dell Cohen agrees. "People are living longer and we're not going to hide in the bushes."\par \par \uc2 In the US, as all over the west, the population is ageing. There are now more than 57 million Americans aged 60 and older, according to census data, and the fastest-growing segment of the senior population is people aged 85 and over. According to a 2012 Nielsen survey, Baby Boomers alone are responsible for 49% of purchasing decisions in America, but less than 5% of advertising is currently directed at them.\par \par \uc2 In the United States now, says Plioplyte, "I think we are way more into the idea of being female as a 'girly', sexy thing, rather than embracing women at every stage of life.\par \par \uc2 I mean, an older woman is a 'cougar' if she tries to look good. I think here, more than in any other country that I know of, age is shunned." In her native Lithuania, Plioplyte notes, older people are treated with more respect.\par \par \uc2 "The focus is on youth," says Murdock flatly. "Especially in fashion." She doesn't relate to 14- and 15-year-old models in magazines. "They look like kids dressing up in their mothers' clothes." In 2012 \uc2 Steven Meisel\uc2  shot Murdock for a Lanvin campaign. "I can't afford the dress that I wore in the ad," she admits. She lives on a fixed income in NYU faculty housing (she spent 30 years working as an administrative assistant to an NYU maths professor, during which time she earned three arts degrees). "It was a $4,000 dress. Kim Kardashian bought it."\par \par \uc2 Ageing has, for these women, brought with it a kind of liberation. "We all want some kind of approval," says Lynn Dell Cohen, "but I think you have to like yourself first."\par \par \uc2 "I am not afraid," says Carpati warmly. "That's what age can do for you. It gives you a freedom! I don't care. I must sound outrageous to you, do I?" she says. "I'm free."\par \par \uc2 One of the documentary's most memorable scenes depicts Royce Smithkin in Provincetown, Massachusetts, with Karen, her friend of 55 years. Karen is suffering from dementia, and the two sit in beach chairs holding hands and belting out show tunes. Karen, says Royce Smithkin, passed away last winter.\par \par \uc2 "When you get older, you don't have to have everything," she says. "You don't have to go to every party. Life goes on just the same. When I was younger, if there were six parties, I thought I had to go to every one or I'd miss something. But now, every day living is a party."\par \par \uc2 Advanced Style is at UK cinemas from 6 May\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Vintage performance: (above) Ilona Royce Smithkin and, right, Joyce Carpati\par \par \uc2 'At physical therapy they asked me: "Oh, is this a fashion show?"\par \par \uc2 I said: 'Yes, it is!": Lynn Dell Cohen\par \par \uc2 Tea for two: Lynn Dell Cohen with Ilona Royce Smithkin.

\par\par \uc2 Observer In Focus Pages\par \b \uc2 In Focus: Asian, Muslim and ex-Labour: the hidden supporters who could help Ukip break the mould: The party once dismissed by \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  as 'fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists' is on the march - drawing on an ever-widening support base in the runup to local and European elections.\b0\par\par\uc2 Toby Helm and Lucy Fisher   \par \uc2 1,707 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 26\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Seema Takhar does not fit the normal stereotype of a Ukip voter. Nor is she very interested in politics most of the time. But when she hears what Nigel Farage's party has to say on the subject of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , it resonates.\par \par \uc2 It is midway through a weekday afternoon and Seema is busy dealing with clients in the beauty salon she runs in Havering, east London, when Lawrence Webb, a UK Independence party councillor, drops in with some local election leaflets. "Yes, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is a big issue for me here," she tells him, adding she will now consider voting for Ukip. "When our family came here in the 70s they got no help. We had to work for everything. It is all different now.\par \par \uc2 "Many of the \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  today come and live on benefits and in council homes. Their children will live on benefits too because that is all they know. I don't think that is right."\par \par \uc2 Seema's mother Renu, who came to the UK in 1973 from Kenya (the family originates from India), walks into the salon and reinforces the message. Renu now works in a post office and says much of her time is spent sending "moneygrams" abroad for \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  supporting families back home. "A lot of money is made here but is leaving the country. When we made money here it stayed in the UK," she says.\par \par \uc2 Webb, who became the first directly elected Ukip councillor in London in a byelection last year, refers loosely to such families as part of the "Windrush generation". They have been here for two or three generations, he says, have worked hard, done well, are part of the community and now, in many cases, find their children can't get work and have to compete for houses and places in schools with new \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from the EU. The result, says Webb, is that they are now turning for help to Ukip, which wants to end Europe's open borders policy.\par \par \uc2 If Farage's party - under sustained attack in recent weeks for being packed with racists - was only, or mainly, drawing its support from crusty old colonels in the shires who dislike multicultural Britain and metropolitan Tories such as \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , it would not be proving so resilient in the polls. Something more complicated and deeper is going on.\par \par \uc2 Ukip is on the march because it is exciting interest from people across the spectrum, from disgruntled Conservatives certainly, but also from ex-Labour supporters, the generally disaffected, the hitherto politically disengaged, and longer-established \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  families with socially conservative views. The party had no councillors in the borough of Havering until last year; it now has seven and Webb believes Ukip will be in coalition with the Tories and Labour after the local elections this month. "There is little doubt it will be in no overall control," he says.\par \par \uc2 Down the road in Barking and Dagenham, where Labour won every seat in 2010, there are equally surprising moves to Ukip. Four Labour councillors recently defected to Farage's party, including the first Asian to do so in the area, Tariq Saeed, who is a practising Muslim and proud to call himself British. Saeed told the Barking and Dagenham Post: "Ukip is not a racist party. Ukip is saying we aren't gaining anything while we are in the EU. We want to put the British people first."\par \par \uc2 Such backing from an Asian, Muslim, ex-Labour councillor suggests Ukip, though containing plenty of unfortunate types, now has a support base far more complex and varied than was the case in 2006 when Cameron dismissed the party as a "bunch of . . . fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists mostly". The past week has seen Ukip continue to defy the normal rules of politics, as more revelations about the bizarre and outrageous views of some of its members have coincided with opinion polls showing it going from strength to strength. On Wednesday its local election candidate William Henwood resigned from the party after the Observer revealed that he had suggested the comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a "black country". No sooner had Henwood taken his bow than one of Ukip's ex-donors, Demetri Marchessini, told Channel 4 News that he thought there was no such thing as marital rape and that women should be banned from wearing trousers because they "discourage love making".\par \par \uc2 Such outlandish comment has been all too easy for the media to uncover. The Tories hoped all this, and Farage's decision not to stand in the forthcoming Newark parliamentary byelection - which they said showed he was frightened - would finally puncture his party's bubble. But instead a ComRes poll found support for Ukip in the runup to the European elections on 22 May had shot up by eight points to 38% while support for Labour and the Tories had fallen by three points each to 27% and 18%.\par \par \uc2 Farage accused the media and the establishment parties of going for Ukip while failing to subject themselves to similar scrutiny. "So what is it about Ukip that makes it racist for us to talk about migration, but not the other parties? Could it be because we're not part of their club? It smacks of a cartel, trying to restrict entry into the market for new competitors. And I think it's one which will backfire on them."\par \par \uc2 On that he seems to be right, at least for now. With less than three weeks to go until the council and European elections, Ukip has taken over from the Liberal Democrats as the natural party of protest, hitting the Tory and Labour votes into the bargain. The Tories are resigned to coming third in the European elections behind Labour and Ukip. Their coalition partners, the pro-EU Lib Dems, face the potential loss of all 11 of their MEPs in the Strasbourg parliament, and are expected to lose 250 to 350 town hall seats.\par \par \uc2 Up and down the country Ukip is establishing local support in a way the Lib Dems - when untainted by power - used to. In pockets across the south-west, where Nick Clegg's party has traditionally been strong, Ukip is breathing down Lib Dem necks. In Stroud, in the Severn valley, the Lib Dems usually table a full list of candidates in council elections. This year just three Lib Dem candidates will contest the 18 seats up for election. Ukip, by contrast, is fielding 10, two of whom, Angie Lyes and Jim Simpson, have defected not from the Tories but from Labour.\par \par \uc2 Caroline Stephens, chairwoman of Ukip in Stroud, hopes her party will win its first council seats, possibly gaining as many as six. On the leafleting trail, she concedes that racist comments and gaffes by Ukip candidates have left her vulnerable to negative comments. In one shop on Friday afternoon, the proprietor greeted Stephens, saying: "Oh, it's the mad woman again." But he said he was likely to vote Ukip nonetheless.\par \par \uc2 Sir Graham Watson, the Lib Dems' only MEP in the south-west, admitted his chances of re-election next month were low: "I think the Ukip vote is very strong. Ukip, in a sense, almost started here, in that this is the region in which they won their first European parliamentary seat. It's been going up since then." Gawain Towler, third on Ukip's European election slate, added: "The Lib Dems are a busted flush. If they think the south-west is one of the few seats they'll keep, on the ground it really doesn't feel that way. They are in real trouble."\par \par \uc2 In the north, Ukip threatens a similar disturbance to the old order. Edward McMillan-Scott, who defected to the Lib Dems from the Tories in 2010 and is now one of two Lib Dem MEPs in the region, says his chances of extending his 30-year stay in the European parliament are on a knife edge. "It is very tight. If I don't do it, it will be because of Ukip," he says.\par \par \uc2 With local and European election day fast approaching, and a year until the general election, the established parties have not found a way to knock Ukip off its perch. Farage's party seems to be thriving and widening its base, and its message on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and Europe is more popular than its opponents dare to admit. The Tories seem confused. They want Ukip voters back but seem locked into a strategy of insulting the party to which they have defected in the meantime. At the Conservative party's European election launch on Friday, Cameron said: "I don't need to discredit Ukip - they do a good enough job themselves."\par \par \uc2 Across the road from Seema Takhar's Pink Salon in Havering, another local business owner says he is no longer bothered by what Cameron says. He too is thinking of voting Ukip because he is fed up with all the others. It is the parties that have wielded power, not Ukip, that are discredited. "I have seen Tories and Labour have power and not seen any difference," he says. "They don't do what they say."\par \par \uc2 Caption:\par \par \uc2 '\b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is a big issue for me'\par \par \uc2 Seema Takhar runs a beauty salon in Havering, east London. Her mother, Renu, came to the UK in 1973 from Kenya. Seema says she is not normally interested in politics, but will listen carefully to Ukip's message, because \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is a key concern for her: "When our family came here in the 70s they got no help. We had to work for everything. It's all different now. Many of the \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  today come and live on benefits and in council homes. Their children will live on benefits, too, because that's all they know. I don't think that's right."

\par\par \uc2 Observer In Focus Pages\par \b \uc2 In Focus: COMMENTARY: Labour doesn't just want to run the country, we want to change the way Britain is run\b0\par\par\uc2 by Douglas Alexander and Spencer Livermore   \par \uc2 766 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 26\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It used to be said that oppositions never win elections, governments lose them. Maybe that once held true. But not here - and not this time. This Wednesday marks exactly one year before the date of that general election. We are clear that on 7 May 2015 Labour will have to win the argument and so give Britain the change election we never had four years ago.\par \par \uc2 The last election was held in the immediate aftermath of the global financial meltdown. The next must be a chance for voters to decide the direction of our country, how it is run - and who it is run for.\par \par \uc2 We are confident that the Conservatives are beatable. It is 22 years since they last won a parliamentary majority. Their membership - with an average age of 68 - is poised to fall below 100,000 for the first time. And any lingering sense of compassionate Conservatism has evaporated in the toxic fumes of a party being dragged to the right by its own backbenchers and Ukip.\par \par \uc2 But they can still be expected to outspend us by as much as three to one, while \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  is promising to dust down the playbook of smear and fear from 1992, knowing that large sections of the press can be relied upon to help him.\par \par \uc2 The outline of how they will fight could be seen last week when Ed Miliband launched our local and European campaign with a sensible market-based policy on rents. The Tories responded by comparing him to Hugo Chavez.\par \par \uc2 No matter how wrong-headed and out-of-touch this government becomes, we cannot expect the pendulum to swing back automatically. Already much work has been done to re-establish enduring components for Labour's electoral success: clarity of strategy, effective rebuttal, and superior field organisation with our network of community organisers.\par \par \uc2 Much else is changing fast. Politics is increasingly on the periphery of an ever-multiplying range of media competing for people's attention while also subject to higher levels of cynicism than ever before.\par \par \uc2 So to win a clear majority in 2015, Labour's strategy for the year ahead is organised around three imperatives.\par \par \uc2 First, in this post-crash election, Labour will lay before the British people the boldest, most radical offer in a generation. One of the reasons David Axelrod has agreed to join our campaign, having masterminded Barack Obama's presidential victories, is because Ed Miliband is a leader who understands the scale of the challenge in reconnecting the wealth of economies like Britain and America to the everyday family finances of their people.\par \par \uc2 Under his leadership, Labour has placed the cost-of-living crisis on the centre stage of British politics. It is a crisis that demands we reform the market, while the fiscal problems we will inherit mean we must be reformers of the state too. That is why Jon Cruddas's policy review is delivering bold ideas such as devolving power away from Whitehall, integrating health and social care, and setting out new approaches to making work pay.\par \par \uc2 Second, we will show we have moved on from the past. Instead of trying to convince voters they were wrong to reject us in 2010, Ed Miliband has learnt from the British people's desire for change. He understands that a party committed to social justice must respond to real concerns that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has, in some communities, led to undercutting of wages and conditions.\par \par \uc2 And he recognises it is not enough to be different and radical - we must be credible too. Our plans for government will be based on the firm commitment that Labour will balance the books and secure maximum value from every penny of taxpayers' money.\par \par \uc2 Finally, we have a responsibility to set out clearly the consequences of a second term of Tory government for decent jobs, our \uc2 NHS\uc2  and the living standards of hardworking families - while pinning the Liberal Democrats to their record of propping up \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This is the strategy on which Labour intends to secure a majority in a year's time. We aspire not only to run the country but to change the way the country is run, so we will have to overcome powerful interests determined to stop us.\par \par \uc2 Bringing change is never easy. But this is how Labour will win.\par \par \uc2 Douglas Alexander\uc2  is chairperson of Labour's general election strategy. Spencer Livermore is general election campaign director.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140504ea540001i\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Home Scotland\par \b \uc2 27% think Ukip ARE a racist party but 29% still back them\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID WOODING, Sunday Political Editor   \par \uc2 840 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par 16:23\par \uc2 thescottishsun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESCOT\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd.

Yet they are still prepared to desert mainstream political parties to support him.\par \par \uc2 Ukip are poised to win the European parliamentary elections because voters think Mr Farage is more \u8220\'20\'1Cin touch".\par \par \uc2 More than a quarter of Tories and one in ten Labour backers will vote Ukip on May 22. But they will return to the fold at the General Election a year from now, according to a special YouGov poll for The Sun on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 The verdict comes after a week of controversy over Ukip candidates\u8217\'20\'19 outpourings. More than a quarter of voters \u8212\'20\'14 27 per cent \u8212\'20\'14 say Ukip are a racist party with many racist members and supporters.\par \par \uc2 A further 35 per cent think Ukip are not racist but attract supporters with racist, extreme or odd views.\par \par \uc2 But the image has failed to dent the Farage bandwagon, which is set to steamroller its way to success in the Euro elections. Ukip top the poll with 29 per cent support, three points ahead of Labour and six above the Tories. The party\u8217\'20\'19s tough stance on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is pulling in support.\par \par \uc2 Almost a third \u8212\'20\'14 29 per cent \u8212\'20\'14 back their planned controls. And Mr Farage is neck-and-neck with Labour leader Ed Miliband as the party chief most in touch with ordinary people.\par \par \uc2 But when it comes to what voters see as the biggest issue \u8212\'20\'14 the economy \u8212\'20\'14 the Tories are way out in front.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  is also streets ahead as the man most suited to be Prime Minister. He is also seen as the most decisive and the most likeable leader.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Not damaging support\u8217\'20\'19 But while his personal rating is better than Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s, his party lags three points behind Labour.\par \par \uc2 Two-thirds of people have had enough of coalition government and would rather see a single party in power after the election on May 7 next year. But if Britain ends up with another hung Parliament, they would marginally favour a Labour-Lib Dem alliance next time around.\par \par \uc2 YouGov\u8217\'20\'19s Anthony Wells said: \u8220\'20\'1CDespite most people thinking Ukip attracts racists \u8212\'20\'14 even if it\u8217\'20\'19s not racist itself \u8212\'20\'14 that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t appear to be damaging the party\u8217\'20\'19s support.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Conservatives have a big lead on the economy but on many other issues \u8212\'20\'14 like the cost of living, health and housing \u8212\'20\'14 Labour have the advantage. Where the Conservatives are really ahead is leadership, with Mr Cameron seen as far above his rivals."\par \par \uc2 The Tories lead by 18 points as the best party to grow the economy, but Labour\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Ccost-of-living crisis" push has Mr Miliband 20 points up for ensuring wages keep pace with prices.\par \par \uc2 And while Mr Cameron is seen as the best leader on the world stage, Mr Miliband is seen as more honest.\par \par \uc2 Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: \u8220\'20\'1COn key issues such as the economy and welfare, we have taken the difficult decisions needed to turn our country around. All Ed Miliband offers is more spending, borrowing and taxes."\par \par \uc2 After four years in power, voters say the Coalition\u8217\'20\'19s best success is raising the personal tax allowance to \u163\'00\'A310,000 \u8212\'20\'14 which the Lib Dems say was THEIR idea. They are also praised for capping benefits, freezing fuel duty, cutting the deficit and legalising gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 But the bedroom tax, higher tuition fees, \uc2 Royal Mail\uc2  privatisation, raising VAT and cutting the 50p tax rate are seen as their worst deeds.\par \par \uc2 Most of us think we are worse off By PETER KELLNER, YouGov President\par \par \uc2 THE old saying \u8220\'20\'1Cit\u8217\'20\'19s the economy, stupid" remains true and it\u8217\'20\'19s the phrase that will decide next year\u8217\'20\'19s General Election.\par \par \uc2 But the question is, which party will the economy help?\par \par \uc2 YouGov\u8217\'20\'19s poll found that the Tories trounce Labour by two to one when voters were asked who they trust most to keep the economy growing. Labour leads by the same huge margin on making sure ordinary people\u8217\'20\'19s wages keep up with inflation.\par \par \uc2 In the long run, the economy and living standards go hand in hand. Millions think differently on these two things. That\u8217\'20\'19s why \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  talks about Britain\u8217\'20\'19s growth numbers, which are beginning to perk up, while Ed Miliband stresses the \u8220\'20\'1Ccost of living crisis", which voters feel.\par \par \uc2 In our poll, more think they are worse off than a year ago.\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg hopes voters will think that the best thing the Coalition has done \u8211\'20\'13 raising the personal tax allowance to \u163\'00\'A310,000 \u8211\'20\'13 was a Lib Dem idea.\par \par \uc2 Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s Nigel Farage is gaining ground by blaming our troubles on Europe and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Our poll shows all four party leaders have a message that chimes with voters.

The result is a melodic and subtle sound.\par \par \uc2 Among the highlights are the sultry Honey Hush, a love song called Say You Will be Mine, the moving Home Ground and Worker, which bounces along. DeMeyer, who was born in Michigan to Belgian-German \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , writes poignantly about her mother's experiences in the Second World War in the song Build Me a Fire.\par \par \uc2 The title track, Savannah Road, was inspired by Gregg Allman\u8217\'20\'19s book My Cross to Bear.\par \par \uc2 This is soulful Americana of a very high standard.\par \par \uc2 Brigitte DeMeyer: Savannah Road (BDM Records: see {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.brigittedemeyer.com/home/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 www.brigittedemeyer.com}}}\uc2  )\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/10542415/Top-10-country-albums-of-2013.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 TEN TOP COUNTRY ALBUMS OF 2013}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140504ea5400231\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Ed Miliband isn't the new Michael Foot. He's the new \uc2 Michael Howard\b0\par\par\uc2 By Robert Colvile   \par \uc2 872 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par 13:56\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband's first job in politics was as an intern for Tony Benn. And it's starting to feel, as Labour begins to flesh out its policy platform for 2015, that he's doing his very best to keep the old boy's spirit alive.\par \par \uc2 After last week's kerfuffle {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/buy-to-let/10801014/Labour-rent-controls-policy-begins-to-unravel-critics-claim.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 over rent controls}}}\uc2 , the Sunday papers are full of old-school Labour wheezes \u8211\'20\'13 a nanny-statist{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2619655/Labours-nanny-state-plan-drinkers-smokers-unhealthy-eaters-sparks-revolt-party-Red-Ed-says-FORCE-fit.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  crackdown on fast food, alcohol, obesity and lack of exercise}}}\uc2 ; {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/03/rail-state-control-ed-miliband"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 the renationalisation of the railways}}}\uc2 ; and a letter to the Prime Minister asking him to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/10807399/Pfizer-bid-for-Astra-must-face-national-interest-test-says-Miliband.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 stop acting as a cheerleader for Pfizer}}}\uc2  in its attempt to take over that great British company, \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Admittedly, neither of the first two ideas is \u8211\'20\'13 yet \u8211\'20\'13 official party policy. But it was extremely striking that, when Ed appeared on The Andrew Marr Show this morning, he refused to distance himself from either of them. Both options were, he insisted, still under review. (He also, incidentally, got some good licks in on Nigel Farage, which had his supporters on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  purring.)\par \par \uc2 For our man on the Marr sofa, Fraser Nelson, it was further proof of what he calls {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/culturehousedaily/2014/05/health-diktats-rail-renationalisation-labours-leftwards-lurch-continues/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 "Labour's Leftward lurch"}}}\uc2 . "Time and time again," Fraser writes, "we see that Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s plans for government tend not to involve government. They tend to involve edicts that he\u8217\'20\'19d issue to those who don\u8217\'20\'19t work for government. Landlords, power companies, moneylenders \u8211\'20\'13 and, today, supermarkets."\par \par \uc2 From a policy point of view, this is deeply problematic. Miliband's agenda may be an elegant solution to how you bring socialism back when you don't have money to spend \u8211\'20\'13 but the risk is that by making markets "work in the public interest", you stop them working as markets at all.\par \par \uc2 But there's something more interesting at work here than just Ed Miliband {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/10325076/Ed-Miliband-Im-bringing-socialism-back-to-Britain.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 being a not-so-secret socialist}}}\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 though obviously, his political instincts are far to the Left of most of the electorate. Rather, it's that he's fallen into the same trap as \uc2 Michael Howard\uc2  did as Tory leader.\par \par \uc2 Think back to Ed's biggest political moment last year \u8211\'20\'13 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/10331012/Labour-Miliband-pledges-to-freeze-energy-prices.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 his announcement of an energy price freeze}}}\uc2 . Never mind that the details were hideously impractical, or that the very prospect of it sent the markets into turmoil and jeopardised vital infrastructure investment. It was both popular and populist, setting the agenda and leaving Ed, temporarily, as king of the political castle.\par \par \uc2 So what does an Opposition leader do, as the economy improves and the Government remorselessly chips away at his poll lead? He goes back to the same well. Housing costs are a huge problem \u8211\'20\'13 so let's cap them. We don't like foreigners buying British firms \u8211\'20\'13 so let's stop them. We have to pay through the nose for a season ticket \u8211\'20\'13 so let's kill off the corporate profiteers. And the same goes for state-owned bankers who think they're going to get a bonus\u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 The interesting thing is, none of these policies, taken in isolation, is a bad idea \u8211\'20\'13 in terms of their popular appeal, that is (from a policy point of view, they're mostly awful). They're certainly meat and drink to the party faithful. But exactly the same was true of the Tories' pledges back in 2005, when \uc2 Michael Howard\uc2  took on Tony Blair. More police. Cleaner hospitals. Lower taxes. Better discipline in schools. Controls on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Greater public accountability. Most voters \u8211\'20\'13 and especially most Tory voters \u8211\'20\'13 would have said yes to all of the above, and enthusiastically so.\par \par \uc2 The problem came when you took them as a whole. As Lord Ashcroft's famed electoral post-mortem, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.lordashcroft.com/pdf/GeneralElectionReport.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Smell the Coffee}}}\uc2 , found, people liked the policies \u8211\'20\'13 but hated the Tories. Partly, that was because the party's brand was still contaminated from 1997 (thanks to Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell's world-class job of demonising the Major government). But partly it was because, when you looked at the manifesto as a whole, it gave off an image of the Tories as small-minded, authoritarian, hostile to modernity and, well, just plain {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2306621.stm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 nasty}}}\uc2 . In the end, the public decided that Howard was a good Opposition leader, expert at highlighting areas of public concern and devising popular, populist responses. But a prime minister? Sorry, but no.\par \par \uc2 And that, in short, is where Ed Miliband finds himself. Each of his policies, each of his interventions, gives him a short-term boost. But taken together, they amount to a drastic shift in the role of the state \u8211\'20\'13 one that is more intrusive both in the workings of the market and in how we live our daily lives.\par \par \uc2 The idea, perhaps, has been to come up with enough popular policies to outweigh Red Ed's biggest electoral disadvantage \u8211\'20\'13 namely, that voters {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/the-british-public-still-think-ed-miliband-is-weird"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 still think he's just a bit weird}}}\uc2 . But as in 2005, it adds up to an electoral offer that only a party loyalist could love. \uc2 Michael Howard\uc2  asked voters: are you thinking what we're thinking? And the answer he got was the same that Red Ed is set to get in 2015: a resounding no.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140504ea54002jp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister could take on Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader in a televised debate that will also include Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green party\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  is ready to take on Nigel Farage in a live televised debate before the election.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister plans to take part in three leaders\u8217\'20\'19 debates with his political rivals.\par \par \uc2 In a plan drawn up by his aides Mr Cameron would be willing to appear in television debates in a 2-3-5 format, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 The Sunday Times}}}\uc2  reported.\par \par \uc2 One head-to-head with Ed Miliband the Labour leader - as the other potential prime minister - a second, which would also include Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg and a third with Mr Farage and the Green party leader Natalie Bennett.\par \par \uc2 One of the debates would be held during the campaign, with the other beforehand, the newspaper reported.\par \par \uc2 Grant Shapps, the Conservative Party Chairman said that \u8220\'20\'1Call options are on the table\u8221\'20\'1D for the format of the debates and did not rule out the possibility of Mr Farage taking part.\par \par \uc2 Speaking on Sky\u8217\'20\'19s Murnaghan Mr Shapps said that leader debates were a \u8220\'20\'1Cgood innovation\u8221\'20\'1D but that negotiations would not happen until the end of the year, after the Scottish referendum in September.\par \par \uc2 Mr Shapps said: \u8220\'20\'1CWhat I am very clear about we think they are a good innovation. I don\u8217\'20\'19t want to see them dominate the campaign itself, which was a genuine problem with people out in the country not getting to see some people coming to their region because it was all basically taken over by the debate, prep for the debate, the post-debate analysis which took ever the election\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut we are very clear that the debates should take place, that they are a good idea \u8211\'20\'13 negotiations on exact details, who should be involved, all of that will be this autumn.\par \par \uc2 Usually these debates are about which person is likely, or has a potential to be, Prime Minister in this country after a general election.\par \par \uc2 He added: \u8220\'20\'1CAll options are on the table right now.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband, the Labour leader said that he would be willing to debate Mr Farage. However, pointing to Nick Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s unsuccessful performance in head to head debates with Mr Farage on Europe and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , he would not commit to a head to head with the Ukip leader.\par \par \uc2 Mr Miliband told The \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show: \u8220\'20\'1CIt is up the broadcasters who they invite, whether they invite Nigel [Farage]. My main desire is that the debates go ahead, I think the Prime Minster doesn\u8217\'20\'19t own these debates, the British people own these debates and he can\u8217\'20\'19t wriggle out of them. Asked by Nigel Farage if he would debate him directed Mr Miliband added he was \u8220\'20\'1Chappy\u8221\'20\'1D to have debates about \u8220\'20\'1Call the main issues that we face\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Last month the Labour leader said the previous format of three debates between the three main party leaders over three weeks should be a "starting point" but that he was open to moves such as a less formal setting and greater voter participation in any repeat of the 2010 confrontations.\par \par \uc2 He used a Radio Times article to call for immediate negotiations, accusing his main rival of being the "single biggest obstacle" to them going ahead and suggesting the Tories were keen to deny his cash-strapped party vital publicity.\par \par \uc2 Britain's first such debates, between Mr Cameron, \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  and Mr Clegg, were staged on the BBC, ITV and Sky News in 2010 after prolonged negotiations between the parties and the TV companies, which resulted in very strict rules on the style of questioning and the division of time for leaders' answers.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron has since complained that they "took all the life out" of the campaign amid constant speculation over whether the practice would be revived, and if so in what form.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage repeated his challenge to the Conservative leader in response to claims he was "chicken" for ruling out a run at Parliament in the Newark by-election.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140504ea54001jl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 CULTURE\par \b \uc2 The People: the Rise and Fall of the Working Class 1910-2010 by Selina Todd, review\b0\par\par\uc2 By Juliet Gardiner   \par \uc2 887 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par 11:14\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 An account of the "working class century" prompts the question: why is Britain still plagued by class divisions?\par \par \uc2 Class is a slippery word and a fiercely contested concept. What are the indices that categorise the working, middle and upper classes? Occupation, income, lifestyle or self-designation?\par \par \uc2 Class is not simply a descriptive taxonomy, it is an active one, freighted with political and social meaning \u8211\'20\'13 and occasionally a call to arms. From {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10088573/Karl-Marx-A-Nineteenth-Century-Life-by-Jonathan-Sperber-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Marx}}}\uc2  via {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9810866/George-Orwell-uncovered-A-guided-tour-of-the-Ministry-of-Truth.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 George Orwell}}}\uc2  and E\u8201\'20\'09P Thompson to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9351694/Author-Jilly-Cooper-Bonkbuster-is-dead-because-women-have-lost-their-libidos.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Jilly Cooper}}}\uc2 , sociologists, politicians and writers have tried to distil the essence and function of class as a useful analytical tool \u8211\'20\'13 and in doing so unravelled it further. The working-class aristocracy, the lower middle class (Orwell described himself as lower upper middle class), the squeezed middle (class), the arrivist upper class.\par \par \uc2 It is a national preoccupation that shows no sign of disappearing with frequent references to \u8220\'20\'1Ctoffs\u8221\'20\'1D \u8211\'20\'13 mostly old Etonians, Harrovians or Wykehamists, invariably Oxbridge educated, usually, though not always, with old money \u8211\'20\'13 still top dogs. Television producers prowl round the stately homes of long-lineage aristocrats like the dukes of Bedford and Devonshire. Interest in the working class proliferates, exemplified by the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10587108/Clive-James-on-Benefits-Street-Dont-argue-with-White-Dee-she-might-sit-on-you.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 heated debate over the Channel 4 series Benefits Street}}}\uc2 , and reality shows such as The X Factor, Big Brother, Britain\u8217\'20\'19s Got Talent and The Only Way Is Essex, which shine a fractured spotlight on working-class life, attitudes and aspirations.\par \par \uc2 Selina Todd\u8217\'20\'19s book tells the history of what she designates the \u8220\'20\'1Cworking-class century\u8221\'20\'1D, starting in 1910 when people \u8220\'20\'1Cwho worked with their hands constituted the vast majority of Britons\u8221\'20\'1D. As E\u8201\'20\'09P Thompson, a Marxist, pointed out, it was during the Industrial Revolution that \u8220\'20\'1Cthe working class was present at its own making\u8221\'20\'1D, when colliers and craftsmen banded together to advance their own interests and challenge those of their employers. A class defined as a category of people having a common relation to the means of production \u8211\'20\'13 the seemingly unbridgeable gap between those who own capital, and those who work to produce it.\par \par \uc2 Todd claims that the impetus for her book was when she went to university to read history and found nothing about the kind of working-class family she came from. \u8220\'20\'1CEventually,\u8221\'20\'1D she writes, \u8220\'20\'1CI realised I would have to write this history myself\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 One has to wonder where she looked. There have, over recent years, been several scholarly and dispassionate accounts of working-class life in the 20th century. Ross McKibbin and David Vincent, for example, augmented and exemplified by numerous vivid memoirs such as those by Richard Hoggart, Alice Foley from Bolton and Winifred Foley in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/scienceandnaturebookreviews/9635953/Gossip-from-the-Forest-by-Sara-Maitland-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 the Forest of Dean}}}\uc2 , on which Todd draws in her narrative. There are also the Nab End series about working-class life in Lancashire, and Gilda O\u8217\'20\'19Neill\u8217\'20\'19s account of her life in London\u8217\'20\'19s East End, plus several published recollections of the hunger marchers of the Thirties.\par \par \uc2 The result of Todd\u8217\'20\'19s efforts is a straightforward and useful, if slightly flat, account of oppression faced by the working class. It charts the poverty, lack of opportunity and the largely fruitless attempts to change this unequal relationship through trade union activity.\par \par \uc2 During the Second World War, the task of fighting and provisioning fell heavily on the working class, which made \uc2 common cause\uc2  with the rest of the nation to resist Hitler. After this collective effort they hoped their demands for a better life would be universally realised.\par \par \uc2 Todd interlaces her history with the story of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4714122/Spending-spending-spent.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Viv Nicholson, who on winning millions on the football pools in 1961}}}\uc2 , exuberantly vowed to \u8220\'20\'1CSpend, Spend Spend!\u8221\'20\'1D \u8211\'20\'13 and did so to such an extent that within seven years she was spent.\par \par \uc2 This parable magnifies Todd\u8217\'20\'19s contention that the \u8220\'20\'1Cfall\u8221\'20\'1D of the working class was due to the government\u8217\'20\'19s failure to deliver on the post-war promise of a better life provided by the welfare state and the false rhetoric of politicians promising social mobility, improved education and full employment. Disillusioned workers turned their backs on class solidarity and communal action and found solace in individual rewards and a degree of power through consumption \u8211\'20\'13 new houses, cars, foreign holidays, televisions and gadgets.\par \par \uc2 Lately, however, there has been growing pride in acknowledging working-class roots in autobiographies and memoirs, either the struggle out of poverty and low expectations, or nostalgia for a lost community of family and neighbourly warmth, support and gossip. A celebration of \u8220\'20\'1Cstreet cred\u8221\'20\'1D in music, speech, food and fashion, much borrowed from second-generation \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  communities, has elevated working-class culture to the status of cool.\par \par \uc2 Yet, as Todd points out, the class rhetoric has been refreshed by politicians: the class struggle has come full circle both with a widening gap between rich and poor and a nomenclature that recalls the 19th-century view of the \u8220\'20\'1Cdeserving\u8221\'20\'1D and the \u8220\'20\'1Cundeserving poor\u8221\'20\'1D, as \u8220\'20\'1Cstrivers and shirkers\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781848548817"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  The People: the Rise and Fall of the Working Class 1910-2010 by Selina Todd }}}\par \par \uc2 456pp, John Murray, Telegraph offer price:\u160\'00\'A0\u163\'00\'A323 (PLUS \u163\'00\'A31.35 p&p) (RRP \u163\'00\'A325, ebook \u163\'00\'A312.99).

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 MARRIAGE died last week after a long illness. There will still be weddings, of course. But they won't mean anything any more. They'll be like those certificates saying you are 'Lord of the Manor' which gullible Americans buy.\par \par \uc2 The whole point of marriage was that it was binding for life - 'for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death us do part'.\par \par \uc2 That is what made it such a fortress against other influences. The State couldn't break into it. It was a small, private place where we were sovereign over our own lives.\par \par \uc2 Either you like this or you don't. I believe that raising children as well as we can is the central purpose of our lives. I also think that lifelong marriage is the best way of doing it, and of ensuring that we do not run away from it, as many of us are inclined to do.\par \par \uc2 I also think the greatest test of character most of us will face will come when a husband or wife falls ill and becomes dependent on us. Marriage, by leaving us no choice in this, actually makes it easier.\par \par \uc2 BUT in the late 1960s, Britain and most other Western countries introduced divorce laws that hollowed out the marriage oath.\par \par \uc2 Since then, if either spouse wishes to break the solemn marriage promise, the State and the law actively take that spouse's side. If the other half of the marriage wishes to stay married, he or she can in the end be removed from the home by force, with the threat of prison. I am still amazed that this totalitarian change came about with so little protest.\par \par \uc2 Now the very sharp and influential Sir James Munby, senior judge in the English family courts, has said that couples should be able to end a marriage simply by signing a form at a register office, with no need for lawyers or judges.\par \par \uc2 And, being smart, he has also urged the next obvious step - that cohabiting couples should be treated as if they are officially married once they have stayed together for a couple of years.\par \par \uc2 After all, why not? There's no important difference any more. Official forms long ago stopped referring to 'husband' or 'wife', and those who cling to these archaic terms are frequently told by bureaucrats that they are now in fact 'partners'.\par \par \uc2 I think Sir James will get his wish. And everyone will be happy, happy, happy - except the growing multitude of children who have never known domestic security and now never will, and the lonely, confused old men and women with nowhere to turn but the doubtful comforts of the care home, where their lives can dribble away in a medicated haze, perhaps punctuated by slaps and insults.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 OH HOW I wish HS2 would just go away. It's not just that it's the most pointlessly expensive railway line, it's also cutting through my own family as well as the Chilterns.\par \par \uc2 The mere prospect of HS2 has already blighted my father's house in Camden, and then his firstborn son goes and says that Nimbys like my pop 'are in the humiliating position of having to pretend that there's some environmental objection that they have, that the great crested grebe is going to be invaded or whatever'.\par \par \uc2 That's not true. My environmentalist father has never concealed the fact that what gets his goat is that HS2 has made his lovely stucco villa on Park Village East, yards from the line, virtually unsellable, and that driving trains from the west through Primrose Hill into Euston will cost upwards of \u163\'00\'A310 billion, and cause chaos for Camden Town for a decade.\par \par \uc2 I know whose side I'm on for this one.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 I SEE that even the slow learners in the media are at last picking up on the mountains of reputable research which show that 'antidepressants' are vastly over-prescribed even on their own terms, often have unpleasant side effects, and may not actually be any more effective against 'depression' than sugar pills.\par \par \uc2 Others all eventually follow where this column has led for years, though, of course, they never admit it.\par \par \uc2 So here's a new challenge for the slow learners. I cannot see how anyone can oppose it. Can we please now have a simple rule for all coroners, magistrates and judges?\par \par \uc2 Wherever someone has taken his own life, or wherever someone is accused of taking someone else's life, or of an act of dangerous violence, the police, doctors and pathologists involved should be required to discover whether that person has ever been a user of mind-altering drugs, whether legally prescribed, or illegal.\par \par \uc2 I believe that if this question is asked, it will become plain that there is a frightening correlation between such drugs and such acts. Then, at last, we can do something.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 HAVE you noticed how the BBC discusses UKIP as if it is a problem rather than a legitimate party? Have you observed the pathetic attempts of Tory spin-doctors (who can think of nothing to say in favour of their own organisation) to smear UKIP from morn till night?\par \par \uc2 Have you also noticed the slavish obedience of political journalists, who have spent the past ten years ignoring the biggest issues in British politics - the EU and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - but now recycle these trivial slanders in the hope that they can save the old, dying parties which have spoon-fed them all their stories?\par \par \uc2 This sort of ganging up has not worked on the Scots, who understandably grow fonder of independence with every stupid threat and falsehood. I have a feeling it's not going to work on the English either - and in case you hadn't noticed by now, Nigel Farage is in fact England's answer to Alex Salmond.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 SINCE even home-made BBC productions need subtitles these days, I am surprised the Corporation hasn't been making more of its powerful new German-made mini-series on the Second World War as experienced by 'normal' Germans.\par \par \uc2 By the time you read this, you'll probably have already missed two episodes of Generation War but it's well worth catching up on iPlayer, or perhaps they could repeat it soon. It convulsed Germany when it was shown there last year.\par \par \uc2 It also infuriated Poles, who reasonably thought that it wasn't for the Germans, of all people, to remind them that quite a lot of Poles had been anti-Semites. But it's worth seeing for lots of reasons. First, it is simply good TV, never boring, full of incident, some of it horrible, some of it deeply unlikely, but all of it interesting.\par \par \uc2 If you think modern Germans have fully confronted the horrors of the Hitler era, this drama will show you how very wrong you are. They've barely begun.\par \par \uc2 This helps to explain Berlin's continuing desire to advance coyly behind the smokescreen of the \uc2 European Union\uc2  rather than under its own flag. You might also notice that the film completely ignores the first two years of the war, and only begins with the invasion of, er, Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 IF anyone is charged, tried and convicted for the murder of Jean McConville during the Irish Troubles, what will happen to that person? If I have correctly understood the 1998 Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act, my belief is that he or she would serve a maximum prison sentence of two years. When I asked the \uc2 Northern Ireland Office\uc2  if I was right, they issued a panicky refusal to comment.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Mail On Sunday\par \par \uc2 Document MOSM000020140504ea540000z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

This could be the secret campaign theme: Cameron as you\u8217\'20\'19ve never seen him before.

The Tories stand to be the largest party, but they will be cheated of an overall majority because unreformed constituency boundaries give Labour an inbuilt advantage. Even small-scale Ukip support will lose the Tories seats in some marginals. Left-leaning Lib Dem grass roots who hate being in coalition with the Tories may defect to Labour and won\u8217\'20\'19t countenance another Tory/Lib Dem coalition.

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 How UKIP are you?\b0\par\par\uc2 Josh Glancy's   \par \uc2 847 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 1; Scotland\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Support for Nigel Farage's party is growing. So, whether it's because of his stance on the EU, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  or crime, are you a closet Ukipper? Take Josh Glancy's quiz to find out\par \par \uc2 UKIP's month of April fools is finally over. It's been a bumpy ride. Most recently party donor Demetri Marchessini announced that women shouldn't wear trousers as they "discourage love-making". It was also revealed that the star of the party's anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  poster campaign was a migrant worker.\par \par \uc2 Then another of its poster boys, builder Andre Lampitt, was suspended as a party member after a brief analysis of his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account revealed him to have strayed somewhat from the path of political correctness with a vile denunciation of Muslims and their faith.\par \par \uc2 Women and Muslims weren't the only ones in UKIP's sights. One of its MEPs, Tory apostate Roger Helmer, was found to have described homosexuality as "not a valid lifestyle worthy of equal respect". Party leader Nigel Farage also came in for a kicking, as the media raked over his EU allowances and pointed out that he actually employs an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , his German wife, Kirsten Mehr, as his secretary.\par \par \uc2 But no matter how much ordure so-called Establishment newspapers heap on UKIP, no matter how many gaffes are unearthed, nothing seems able to halt its momentum: it is getting more popular, not less. A poll last week put support for the party in the European elections at 38% \u8212\'20\'14 an increase of eight points in the past month. Labour is down three points on 27%, and the Tories are stuck in third on 18%.\par \par \uc2 Clearly UKIP has wide appeal.\par \par \uc2 Some of it is the protest vote \u8212\'20\'14 those who hate Westminster politics as usual. But for others \u8212\'20\'14 whisper it \u8212\'20\'14 the party's message is beginning to take root. People who have real concerns about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , EU encroachment and where Britain is heading and aren't getting the answers they want from mainstream parties.\par \par \uc2 So how UKIP are you? Take our quiz and find out.\par \par \uc2 1) The government has given \u163\'00\'A3100m to a fund for improving education in India. You think ... a) Outrageous. We already gave them cricket \u8212\'20\'14 what more do they want? b) Why are we handing out wads of cash to one of the world's fastest-growing economies at a time when frontline British services are being cut? c) I'm pro-foreign aid but this is a bit much. We've only just come out of recession, after all d) Great news. Child literacy rates in Uttar Pradesh are appalling 2) A group of young Romanian men move in a few doors down. You... a) Tell your children to walk home from school the long way round b) Are a bit nervous the next time you use a cash machine c) Wave politely as you walk past and hope that they are able to learn English d) Dust off your old Gheorghe Hagi football shirt and knock on the door with a bottle of tzuika in hand 3) An EU-sponsored wind farm is to be built on the beautiful hills where you like to walk. You ... a) Stick on your LP of Winston Churchill's best speeches and load the 12-bore b) Join a local protest group and start handing out leaflets c) Wonder quietly if we might be better off fracking instead d) Gaze admiringly at the splendour of mankind harnessing nature's bounty 4) Some local hoodies are caught vandalising the playground in the park. They should be ... a) Flogged b) Sent to prison c) Put into some sort of national service scheme d) Given a hug 5) A well-known black comedian says there should be more black and ethnic faces on television. You think ... a) None of them is a patch on the Two Ronnies b) Fine but it sounds suspiciously like a quota in the making c) Fair point \u8212\'20\'14 we could do with some more women too d) Yes, and save BBC3!\par \par \uc2 6) David Cameron makes a speech explaining why Britain should stay in a reformed EU. You think ... a) Same old Establishment guff; it will take an earthquake to get us out of Brussels b) This would be a lot more convincing if he had a pint of lager in his hand c) That's all well and good, but will any of these reforms actually happen? d) I much prefer that Herman Van Rompuy To see where you stand, check the Farageometer opposite MOSTLY D U-blip. This reactionary madness can't last much longer. You oppose UKIP on every front.\par \par \uc2 MOSTLY C U-dip instinctively away from Farage and company, but you cannot help but feel that maybe they sometimes have a point.\par \par \uc2 MOSTLY A UKIP through and through. In fact the party may have already gone a little mainstream for you.\par \par \uc2 MOSTLY B U-tip towards the yellow and purple banner. Perhaps like Tim Rice you are "intrigued" by the party as a political phenomenon.\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140504ea54000yo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw157\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2355\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 HS - News\par \b \uc2 Making plans for Nigel\b0\par\par\uc2 EXCLUSIVE  By Tom Gordon  Scottish Political Editor   \par \uc2 775 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Herald\par \uc2 SUNDHE\par \uc2 1\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014, Herald & Times Group   \par \par \uc2 THE protesters who penned Ukip leader Nigel Farage into an Edinburgh pub on his last visit to Scotland have vowed to turn out in force when he returns north of the Border this week.\par \par \uc2 With Ukip riding high in the polls ahead of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  elections, Farage will address supporters at Edinburgh\u8217\'20\'19s Corn Exchange on Friday evening in his sole Scottish appearance before the May 22 vote.\par \par \uc2 In a reference to 2013\u8217\'20\'19s pub debacle, Ukip have dubbed it \u8220\'20\'1Cthe Edinburgh lock-in\u8221\'20\'1D. However, behind the efforts at humour there are signs the party is concerned the event will be a focus for demonstrators who see Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policies as racist.\par \par \uc2 In an email to party members last week, Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s Scottish chairman, Arthur Misty Thackeray, said of Friday\u8217\'20\'19s event: \u8220\'20\'1CSecurity considerations are paramount and as such attendance will be strictly limited to our members and selected guests. We will not be advising the venue location until nearer the time. Door security will be in operation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Farage has already attracted protests as he tours the country campaigning for the elections. On Thursday, a protester hit him with an egg as he campaigned in Nottingham, despite the presence of four newly hired bodyguards.\par \par \uc2 In May 2013, Farage was humiliated in Edinburgh as he tried to help Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s campaign in the Aberdeen Donside Holyrood by-election.\par \par \uc2 About 50 students and socialists chanting \u8220\'20\'1CGo home to England\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1CRacist Nazi scum\u8221\'20\'1D besieged him as he gave media interviews in a pub near the Scottish Parliament, forcing him to leave under escort in a police van.\par \par \uc2 A shaken Farage later claimed the protesters represented the ugly face of Scottish nationalism.\par \par \uc2 He said at the time: \u8220\'20\'1CWe have never had a reception like this anywhere in Britain before. Clearly, it\u8217\'20\'19s anti-British and anti-English. They hate the Union Jack.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The following day he labelled the protesters \u8220\'20\'1Cyobbo fascist scum\u8221\'20\'1D and said they were \u8220\'20\'1Cfilled with a total and utter hatred of the English\u8221\'20\'1D.\u8232\'20\'28The SNP said afterwards that Farage had \u8220\'20\'1Clost the plot\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Scotland has six MEPs \u8211\'20\'13 currently two Labour, two SNP, one Conservative and one Liberal Democrat.\par \par \uc2 Polls suggest LibDem George Lyon is most likely to fail in his bid for re-election, with the SNP and Ukip vying for his seat in Brussels.\par \par \uc2 Law graduate Andrew Ashe, 22, of the Radical Independence Campaign, who was on last year\u8217\'20\'19s Farage protest, said the group would tell Ukip its message of \u8220\'20\'1Cscapegoating \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D for wider economic problems was not welcome in Scotland.\par \par \uc2 Ashe said: \u8220\'20\'1CThere are a lot of people up and down the country who are angry about what Ukip are doing and the coverage they\u8217\'20\'19re getting in the media, and who want to oppose this. We\u8217\'20\'19ve shown before in Edinburgh that Ukip and their message are not welcome. This [Friday] will be a big and lively protest and we call on all the groups that oppose Ukip to come along.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Colin Fox, co-convener of the Scottish Socialist Party, said his members would also be turning out to confront Ukip.\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe socialist way is to welcome people and we\u8217\'20\'19ll extend a nice welcome to Mr Farage. I\u8217\'20\'19m really looking forward to it, given how he was received last time here.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe can remind him how much we like \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  here, rather than his xenophobic poison.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Friday\u8217\'20\'19s event also includes speeches from Thackeray and the party\u8217\'20\'19s lead Scottish MEP candidate David Coburn, plus a question-and-answer session.\par \par \uc2 Ukip said buses would bring supporters from Glasgow, Perth, Dundee, Fife, Inverness, Aberdeen and the Scottish Borders.\par \par \uc2 A Ukip spokesman said Farage \u8220\'20\'1Cwasn\u8217\'20\'19t afraid of anything\u8221\'20\'1D and would not be deterred by \u8220\'20\'1Ca bunch of middle-class students\u8221\'20\'1D demonstrating.\par \par \uc2 The spokesman said: \u8220\'20\'1CSecurity is part and parcel of the game, sadly. We\u8217\'20\'19ve got to a place where we are obviously making a difference and those who wish us not to make a difference wish to stop us. There will no doubt be a demonstration, and if it\u8217\'20\'19s the same bunch of hairy types that had a go last time, fine.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Green Party Euro candidate Maggie Chapman said: \u8220\'20\'1CNigel Farage and his party have been stoking up intolerance about \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  in this election campaign.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAs someone who came to live in Scotland 16 years ago and found our country very welcoming, I would like Mr Farage to hear the case for treating people as equals. That\u8217\'20\'19s why I\u8217\'20\'19m challenging him to debate with me here in Scotland.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document SUNDHE0020140504ea540001m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw157\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2355\pichgoal600

Smears\b0\par\par\uc2 NO BYLINE   \par \uc2 1,219 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Herald\par \uc2 SUNDHE\par \uc2 1\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014, Herald & Times Group   \par \par \uc2 It might come as little surprise that the Sunday Herald has elected to be the first, and so far the only paper in Scotland, to declare support a Yes vote in the independence referendum in September. But it wasn\u8217\'20\'19t a decision that was taken lightly. There was a vigorous debate among those involved in the paper.\par \par \uc2 The general hostility to independence in much of the rest of the media does not appear to be delivering the expected momentum for the No side. In fact, the polls have been narrowing over the past two months since the Chancellor, \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 , delivered his Declaration of the Pound.\par \par \uc2 Last week, YouGov recorded its highest Yes vote yet, at 42% after don\u8217\'20\'19t knows were excluded. No has a comfortable lead at 58%. But more worrying for Better Together, YouGov confirmed that many Scots don\u8217\'20\'19t believe the Chancellor\u8217\'20\'19s claim that \u8220\'20\'1Cif Scotland walks away from the UK it walks away from the pound\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Forty five percent still think there will be a monetary union after independence, against 38% who think Scotland will lose the pound. Voters also seem to be defying the scare that Scotland would be thrown out of Europe if it votes Yes. Forty six percent believe Scotland would remain a member of the EU, according to YouGov, against 32% who think not.\par \par \uc2 This is serious stuff. A credibility gulf appears to be swallowing the two key issues on which the No campaign chose to fight this battle: Europe and the Pound. The attempt to threaten Scots with economic ruin and political exclusion is not working. Indeed, it may have been counter-productive. The Scottish Social Attitudes Survey last week confirmed what we knew anecdotally that Yes voters are far more likely actually to vote in September than the No supporters. This is the problem with a campaign based on fear and threats \u8211\'20\'13 it tends to induce to apathy and lack of motivation rather than determination to act.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps this faltering of momentum for No explains last week\u8217\'20\'19s rather desperate attempt to turn the referendum into a verdict, not about Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s future, but about \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s character. Every utterance of \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  is now ripped out of context, twisted around and reinserted into a bogus narrative that Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s First Minister is an apologist for \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 , supports Tory tax cuts, thinks Scotland is a nation of drunks and feels political affinity with Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s Nigel Farage. This is the politics of the smear. A change, perhaps, from saying that Scotland would be thrown out of Europe or the pandas be sent home, but nastier.\par \par \uc2 What Salmond actually said in the GQ magazine interview was: \u8220\'20\'1CWell, obviously, I don\u8217\'20\'19t approve of a range of Russian actions, but I think Putin\u8217\'20\'19s more effective than the press he gets, I would have thought, and you can see why he carries support in Russia. He\u8217\'20\'19s restored a substantial part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing\u8221\'20\'1D. That\u8217\'20\'19s pretty much a statement of fact and what most commentators on Russia had been saying. Remember, this interview was anyway conducted before the annexation of the Crimea.\par \par \uc2 Maybe Salmond should have realised these remarks would be turned against him and zipped his mouth. But accusing Salmond of being an apologist for Putin is rather like saying that David Cameron is an apologist for fascism because he supported the Maidan demonstrations in Kiev, which involved the active participation of a number of far right organisations. Actually, I am distinctly uneasy about the new regime in Ukraine and the way it has been promoted by Nato \u8211\'20\'13 not least because it was installed after the militant overthrow of an elected president.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m not even going to bother with the nonsense about \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  calling Scots \u8220\'20\'1Ca nation of drunks\u8221\'20\'1D \u8211\'20\'13 he said we had a drink problem which is beyond doubt. Or that he is a mate of Nigel Farage and supports tax cuts for the rich. I cannot think of any two politicians who are less alike than the UKIP leader and a First Minister who supports the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , unilateral nuclear disarmament, green energy, open borders, increased \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  etc.\par \par \uc2 But there is a section of the UK media, including some on the metropolitan Left, who are determined to portray \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  as a neofascist because they are unable to comprehend the concept of civic nationalism. To some people, the mere mention of the word nation is suspect \u8211\'20\'13 except of course when it is the British nation.\par \par \uc2 Somehow Tony Blair wasn\u8217\'20\'19t seen as a neofascist when he talked of cool Britannia.\par \par \uc2 Democracy and civic nationalism have always been very closely linked, certainly since the European revolutions in 1848, which was called the Springtime for Nations.\par \par \uc2 When all those Eastern European countries declared their independence from the Soviet Union after 1989 they were not cast as right wing, neo-fascist or reactionary. Scotland is not under the domination of a foreign power, and such comparisons are of limited relevance. But that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t mean that it is wrong for this partially free nation to seek to govern its own affairs if it feels that government from London is no longer acceptable. Scotland never ceased to be a nation after 1707 and has an inalienable right to self-determination. It already has a sovereign national parliament; independence merely extends self-determination to the economic sphere.\par \par \uc2 Federalism might have been a viable alternative to independence had there been an open minded and enlightened regime in Westminster. But that moment is past. The Liberal Democrat Danny Alexander says that a No vote will lead to federalism, but Liberals have been saying that for over a century. It\u8217\'20\'19s certainly not going to happen now. The various schemes for \u8220\'20\'1Cmore powers\u8221\'20\'1D offered by the unionist parties have been unconvincing when they are not incoherent.\par \par \uc2 Even as a non-nationalist, I find myself almost irresistibly drawn therefore to the Yes campaign. As the author and former Bishop of Edinburgh, Richard Holloway \u8211\'20\'13 surely one of the most humane and non-fascist thinkers around \u8211\'20\'13 put it last week at a Saltire Society event, it is impossible in this climate to see any possibility of real change happening without a vote for independence.\par \par \uc2 The only way to achieve federalism in a polity dominated by the myopic city state of London is to remake the UK as what is should always have been: a truly multinational entity in which the component parts \u8211\'20\'13 Ireland, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and the English regions if they wish, have genuine political autonomy. Perhaps then they could come together in a new political arrangement recognising all parts of the UK.\par \par \uc2 But it would have to be on the basis of equality. There can be no continuing with a remote government which so fundamentally lacks an understanding of the moral foundation of Union that it would threaten unilaterally to withdraw the pound and force economic ruin on Scotland.\par \par \uc2 That is redolent of the kind of economic destabilisation that the old British Empire used to deploy in colonial countries in the Middle East and Africa. The demonisation of Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s elected First Minister \u8211\'20\'13 the elected leader of Scotland \u8211\'20\'13 is another.\par \par \uc2 Document SUNDHE0020140504ea540000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw157\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2355\pichgoal600

How no?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Tom Shields   \par \uc2 573 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Herald\par \uc2 SUNDHE\par \uc2 1\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014, Herald & Times Group   \par \par \uc2 I HAVE long since stopped becoming engaged in lengthy debate on the referendum. When asked my position on independence I reach into my pocket and hand out a badge that says: \u8220\'20\'1CHow No?\u8221\'20\'1D This message is understood by those familiar with the Scottish use of \u8220\'20\'1Chow\u8221\'20\'1D instead of \u8220\'20\'1Cwhy\u8221\'20\'1D. For those who aren\u8217\'20\'19t, I may have to get bigger badges with the translation: \u8220\'20\'1CScottish independence? Why ever not?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 I have also stopped taking heed of expert opinion. For every academic/politician/blogger who says Scotland can\u8217\'20\'19t use the pound, won\u8217\'20\'19t get into Europe, or will be mired in poverty, just remember there will be another one along in a minute saying the opposite. I choose to take a naively optimistic view of what we might look forward to when Scotland is no longer part of the Union.\par \par \uc2 This leaves time to consider some arcane historical aspects of the great debate. History is full of examples of Scots against independence. Did you know that:\par \par \uc2 l After the Roman invasion of Scotland \u8232\'20\'28in AD71, the Melius Largior Dando \u8232\'20\'28(Better Together) campaign argued that armed resistance by the Caledonian tribes was counter-productive. Scotland would not be able to access the benefits of the Roman Empire slave economy. The violence could even lead to a border wall being built to prevent Caledonian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  moving south.\par \par \uc2 l During the Scottish wars of independence, the Scottish Lairds with Land in England Association took a dim view of the guerrilla activities of \uc2 William Wallace\uc2  against English occupation and advocated devolution as a sensible \u8232\'20\'28way ahead.\par \par \uc2 l 1707 was a successful year for the Better \u8232\'20\'28 Off with English Gold political faction (aka The Parcel of Rogues in a Nation), who organised the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament and the Union with Westminster.\par \par \uc2 l In 1746, the Better Off with the Hanoverians organisation fought with the mainly English army at the battle of Culloden against the Jacobite forces. It was the last pitched battle on British soil and hopefully will remain so regardless of the outcome of the referendum.\par \par \uc2 l The common factor with those who promoted better togetherness through the ages is that they made a good living out of it. This spirit lives on today with some members of the House of Commons who are noisily in the No camp. Hardly surprising when a fat salary, liberal expenses and a second home with a luxurious three-piece suite and a big flat-screen telly are all paid for from the public purse.\par \par \uc2 l But let us not vilify the Scotsman on \u8232\'20\'28the make for whom the noblest prospect is the high road that leads him to England. The entrepreneur, as Dr Johnson might have said if the word was in his dictionary. They are merely following the example of King James VI of Scotland. He got a better job in 1603 as James I of England and returned north of the Border only once in 22 years.\par \par \uc2 l The Union of 1707 gave Scotland an entree into world trade. Scots did well out of the British empire and Britain did well out of Scotland \u8211\'20\'13 not least in recent years when North Sea oil kept the UK economy afloat. We have had the best of Britain and now it is time to set England free and give them \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  as a going-away present.\par \par \uc2 Document SUNDHE0020140504ea540000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

\par\par \uc2 Editorial; Opinion Columns\par \b \uc2 If you feel like a chicken tonight, Nigel, that's because you are one\b0\par\par\uc2 ROD LIDDLE   \par \uc2 694 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 2; National\par 25\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Iasked a chap in Newark's lovely marketplace whom he intended to vote for in the upcoming by-election. He was about 60, I would guess. Or maybe 50 but had endured a difficult life \u8212\'20\'14 it's hard to tell with northerners, isn't it? I know \u8212\'20\'14 Newark isn't quite the north, and I factored this into my calculations; if this had been Sheffield, say, or Preston, I would have guessed the bloke was anywhere between 18 and 35. Paisley or Motherwell and he'd have been pre-school. But Newark, Notts \u8212\'20\'14 I reckoned about 60, give or take.\par \par \uc2 Anyway, he replied with great enthusiasm: "I will be voting for UKIP."\par \par \uc2 And so my follow-up question was very straightforward: "UKIP? Are you a racist, sir?" He looked at me as if I were mad. "Er ... yes, of course I am."\par \par \uc2 It struck me then that the cross-party alliance recently formed to discredit Nigel Farage's party simply by shouting "racist" at every opportunity might actually be counter-productive. The allegation has somewhat less force beyond the M25 and it might even be a positive selling point for UKIP the further you travel from London's hideous, closeted, purblind sanctimony.\par \par \uc2 The main spokesbore for this attempt to besmirch Farage and his colourful minions is the ludicrous Barbara Roche, who as an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister in Tony Blair's government was at least partly responsible for welcoming to the country an estimated 3m foreign workers who cheerfully took the jobs of largely Labour-supporting natives.\par \par \uc2 This person is possibly the only one left alive within the party who thinks this was a really, really great idea. Even the \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  think it was berserk.\par \par \uc2 As a means of countering UKIP, then, I don't really believe her position has legs, you know? It might even be an idea for UKIP to put giant posters of the insuperably smug Roche in every town stating simply: "This woman hates UKIP" \u8212\'20\'14 and I suspect they'd rise several points in the polls.\par \par \uc2 Given this, why isn't Nigel Farage himself standing in Newark? There is some force to the prime minister's cackled accusation that he has chickened out. Here is a supposedly "middle-England" constituency in which the local people, not just the soi-disant racists, have good cause to be disenchanted with the mainstream parties.\par \par \uc2 The sitting MP, the likeable Conservative Patrick Mercer, was caught in a sting on camera flogging himself to "lobbyists" for \u163\'00\'A34,000, something that rarely goes down well with the electorate. The previous MP \u8212\'20\'14 Labour's Fiona Jones \u8212\'20\'14 was done for chicanery over her election expenses and then controversially had her conviction quashed; she died, not long afterwards, in her home, surrounded by 15 empty bottles of vodka.\par \par \uc2 These twin tragedies, of a kind, may not have commended either of the two main parties to the locals and nobody gives the Lib Dems much of a shout. So you might suppose it would be ripe for UKIP. Ranged against this is Newark's affluence \u8212\'20\'14 it is not, by some margin, an area of deprivation and ill-concealed blue-collar fury, nor is it anything like UKIP's previous redoubt of Poujadist, southeastern, 19th-hole, red-faced, xenophobic carping.\par \par \uc2 If it is that thing, "middle England" \u8212\'20\'14 a phrase that, unless you live in London, has next to no meaning \u8212\'20\'14 then it is comfortable middle England. My guess is that Nigel Farage looked at the figures \u8212\'20\'14 a Conservative majority of more than 16,000 \u8212\'20\'14 and thought: nah, it's not on.\par \par \uc2 But still, it was a chicken-hearted decision and Farage's insistence that this by-election was a "distraction" betrayed, paradoxically, his European obsession.\par \par \uc2 A seat in the House of Commons is a mere bauble compared with the real business of winning those Euro elections \u8212\'20\'14 what an odd thing for someone of Farage's mindset to think.\par \par \uc2 Farage is worried that if he stood in Newark and lost, the "bubble would burst". Maybe but, until you stand, it's still just a bubble.\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140504ea54000pv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage has dodged a tricky by-election but he's on course to beat everyone on May 22, writes Tim Shipman, Political Editor\par \par \uc2 The Forum in Bath might have been designed as a UK Independence party venue. A converted 1930s cinema with echoes of a bygone age, it encapsulates UKIP's blend of box office politics and a very British provincialism.\par \par \uc2 It was here, at 7.21pm last Tuesday, as he prepared to address 1,000 people at his largest rally of the European election campaign so far, that Nigel Farage, the party leader, heard the news that would allow him to dominate the week in politics.\par \par \uc2 The resignation of Patrick Mercer as MP for Newark over a cash-for-questions scandal gave Farage the chance to perform on a bigger stage. With his party rising in the polls in the run-up to the elections on May 22, the chance to become UKIP's first MP seemed to be within his grasp.\par \par \uc2 At 7.25pm, five minutes before he was due to speak, Farage made a mobile phone call to \uc2 Patrick O'Flynn\uc2 , UKIP's director of communications. The leader was already doubtful that standing in the by-election would be a good idea.\par \par \uc2 "He knew very early on that he wasn't going to do it," a senior party figure said. But O'Flynn, a former Daily Express commentator with a shrewd cynicism about politics, realised they could use the speculation to drown out a clamour about poorly vetted UKIP candidates whose racist, homophobic and plain bizarre outbursts were attracting growing coverage.\par \par \uc2 "We decided to have a bit of fun for several days," the source said. "Nigel would say he was interested and we would keep it hanging and there would be a feeding frenzy that would drive Tory high command nuts. It would paralyse them." Farage approved the plan.\par \par \uc2 At the end of the rally the leader declared Newark "seriously tempting" and promptly retired to the Hop Pole, a 16thcentury pub in nearby Limpley Stoke, for the inevitable pint with a press officer, Alex Phillips, and a BBC correspondent, \uc2 Norman Smith\uc2 . In Westminster, where more than 100 MPs and journalists had gathered for drinks at the InterContinental hotel, the talk was of little else.\par \par \uc2 Less than 12 hours later the game was off. Speculation that Farage would run had reached the front pages and the decision was taken to "close it down". Farage used Wednesday's Today programme on Radio 4 to explain why he would not stand in Newark.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to do anything that deflects from the European election campaign," he said. "I think UKIP could cause an earthquake in British politics, from which we can go on and win not just one parliamentary seat but quite a lot of parliamentary seats."\par \par \uc2 Waiting at the BBC's Millbank studios in Westminster were \uc2 Kenneth Clarke\uc2 , the cabinet minister whose Nottinghamshire seat borders Newark, and his parliamentary private secretary, \uc2 Ben Wallace\uc2 . Hearing Farage's words, Wallace began clucking loudly and waggling his arms like a chicken's wings flapping. Within minutes the consensus on social media was that Farage had "bottled it".\par \par \uc2 He was swiftly compared to \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  and David Miliband, who failed to seize their respective moments to win a general election and the Labour leadership.\par \par \uc2 So was dodging Newark a strategic masterstroke or a waste of the best opportunity Farage will ever have to break the mould of British politics? More importantly for the two main parties, can his seemingly inexorable rise be stopped or will he prevent the Conservatives from winning the next election? TODAY'S YouGov poll for The Sunday Times finds that UKIP is still on course for victory in the Euro elections. On 29%, the party is a point clear of Labour and seven ahead of the Tories. Twice as many voters think UKIP has the best \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy as support Tory plans. Only 18% think Farage should have stood in Newark; 54% of UKIP supporters say he did the right thing.\par \par \uc2 Farage now believes he has made "one of the best decisions I have ever taken". Even as the tease strategy unravelled, he still managed to be the biggest news story two days running. Allies point out that a recent study ranked Newark as UKIP's 248th most winnable seat. A friend said he could have won the by-election but "it would have been trickier to hold it next year. If you win at the general election, it's a five-year deal." Party figures want him to confine his search for a Westminster seat to his home county of Kent. His effort to oust John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, from Buckingham in 2010 failed because he was seen as a carpetbagger.\par \par \uc2 "We've learnt our lesson," an ally said. "He needs to run a local campaign and we need Nigel near the television studios in London if we're going to capitalise on the result after May 22."\par \par \uc2 Likely seats include South Thanet, where the Tory europhile Laura Sandys is standing down, neighbouring North Thanet plus Folkestone and Dover.\par \par \uc2 Farage is also keen to promote a cast of new faces to share the spotlight. One of those is the East Midlands MEP Roger Helmer, who defected from the Tories in 2012 and is expected to run in Newark.\par \par \uc2 "He is an old pro," said a UKIP insider. Helmer, 70, has also come under the spotlight for comments made 14 years ago in which he described homosexuality as "abnormal and undesirable". But his views pale beside those of other UKIP candidates.\par \par \uc2 Andre Lampitt, who appeared in an election broadcast, branded the Prophet Muhammad a "pedophile" [sic]. William Henwood resigned as a candidate for \uc2 Enfield council\uc2  after calling for comedian Lenny Henry to emigrate to a "black country". Demetri Marchessini, the party's sixth-largest cash donor last year, took to Channel 4 News on Wednesday to air views on rape, slavery and gay lust, and his belief that women should be banned from wearing trousers.\par \par \uc2 The Tory campaign chief Lynton Crosby has told aides that Farage's followers have "never had any proper scrutiny. He needs to get some." UKIP accuses the Conservatives of digging up dirt. A source close to \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  defended the onslaught, saying: "This is a competence issue. Farage said he would vet all these candidates. It's pretty basic to do a \uc2 Google\uc2  search and find out that someone has called the Prophet Muhammad a paedophile. They're amateur hour." Tory high command believes the focus on extremist candidates is having an effect. Its private polling shows that some voters have reached "hesitation point" over backing UKIP.\par \par \uc2 But Tory MPs are not convinced it is the right approach. "I know we've got researchers dishing out filth on Farage but they forget why people vote for him. They vote for him because he isn't us," said a northern MP. "There's no love for us out there and no sense of wanting to reward us."\par \par \uc2 The willingness of voters to turn a blind eye to UKIP's excesses is striking. Anthony Wells, of YouGov, said: "Even if people think the criticisms of UKIP are fair, they don't necessarily diminish their support \u8212\'20\'14 60% think the accusations about some of UKIP's candidates being racist or extreme are fair but only 21% say it has damaged their view of UKIP."\par \par \uc2 IN DOWNING STREET, a determination to make the government's arguments is mingled with a sense of futility about whether they will make any difference on May 22.\par \par \uc2 The Conservative campaign, outlined at Cameron's election launch on Friday, will highlight the prime minister's record of cutting the Brussels budget and the conviction that only he can give voters a say on the EU. "I will deliver this in-out referendum," he said. "Labour won't. UKIP can't. I will."\par \par \uc2 It is easy to forget that UKIP was struggling in the early part of the year. Then Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, challenged Farage to televised debates on Brussels. Farage won \u8212\'20\'14 comfortably in the first debate, decisively in the second \u8212\'20\'14 and has not looked back. The hope of team Clegg that its man would gain credit with voters for a principled stance has failed to materialise. Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat MP for North Devon, said Clegg had been right to confront Farage "because at the time we were on seven or eight points and that could see us losing all our MEPs. Get 10% or 11% and we might keep half a dozen."\par \par \uc2 However, the party has fallen back to 7% in today's poll, in fifth place behind the Greens. Clegg aims to make a virtue of the Lib Dems' status as "the party of in [Europe]" but an ally said: "Realistically if we get in single digits we could lose the lot."\par \par \uc2 Labour is on course to win several hundred council seats on May 22. Yet as one disgruntled frontbencher asked: "If we do well, is anyone going to notice? It's going to be wallto-wall UKIP."\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband's strategy is to ignore Europe and "road test" his party's message for the general election next year. "It's cost of living stuff, really," one insider said. However, UKIP's focus on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has peeled away a chunk of Labour's working-class support. John Denham, an MP close to Miliband, accused the party last week of making a "complete hash" of its response to UKIP. It was a mistake to call Farage's party racist, he said.\par \par \uc2 For its part UKIP will also continue to hammer home its main points. Farage was in Dover yesterday to unveil a poster depicting an escalator for \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  up the white cliffs. Senior party figures say they will continue to promote the notion that they are fighting a "Lib-Lab-Con pro-European Establishment".\par \par \uc2 If a UKIP triumph on May 22 seems ever more likely, future prospects are less clear. Farage's allies admit their best hope of a real breakthrough is to maintain enough momentum to get 10% of the vote at the general election next year. They speak hopefully of creating a new era of four-party politics in Britain.\par \par \uc2 For the Tories, a crisis is coming. Cameron's closest aides speak hopefully of UKIP voters in 2014 behaving like a man who is about to get married. "People say they'll vote UKIP and come back to us next year," said one senior figure. "It's like a wild stag do in Las Vegas. It's the final fling before you settle down."\par \par \uc2 But even if UKIP support is slashed dramatically, it could be Miliband who ends up in No 10. As a Conservative MP put it: "It will get very hard for Dave when 50 Tory MPs wake up on May 23 and realise that if the results are even slightly replicated next year they will lose their seats. UKIP got 3% in the last general election. If they get 6%, 7%, 8% next time, we'll lose 50 Conservative-Labour marginals. Labour wouldn't need to win a single extra vote."\par \par \uc2 If you feel like a chicken tonight, Nigel, that's because you are one, Rod Liddle, page 25 How UKIP are you?, News Review, page 7\par \par \uc2 WE KNEW THERE'D BE A FEEDING FRENZY THAT WOULD PARALYSE THE TORIES\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140504ea54000pu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Britain is throwing the race for foreign students\b0\par\par\uc2 David Warren   \par \uc2 823 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 1; National\par 29\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A blunderbuss \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy is costing us millions and global influence, warns David Warren\par \par \uc2 Last year, Britain saw the first fall in the number of overseas students at its higher educational institutions for 30 years. In 2011-12, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, there were 435,235. In 2012-13, there were 425,265 \u8212\'20\'14 a drop of just under 10,000. In 2011-12, 302,685 non-EU students were studying here. In 2012-13 there were 299,970 \u8212\'20\'14 a drop of around 2,700.\par \par \uc2 This matters \u8212\'20\'14 higher education is a major British export. Foreign students contribute more than \u163\'00\'A310bn to the British economy through tuition fees and living expenses. Ten thousand fewer students cost the economy about \u163\'00\'A3230m in lost earnings.\par \par \uc2 The impact on our standing in the world is serious too. Surveys have shown that foreign students at British universities view the UK more positively. This creates an international network of partnership, influence and understanding. This is good in itself, helps us promote our national interests abroad, and contributes to a safer and more prosperous world.\par \par \uc2 Other countries understand these connections. That is why the competition between countries with major world universities is so intense. The world market in students is growing rapidly. It doubled in size between 2000 and 2011, from 2.1m to 4.3m. It is predicted to grow to more than 7m by 2020.\par \par \uc2 Ministers promote higher education when they take business missions overseas. And rightly: we should be market leaders, as we have some of the best universities in the world. Why then do we damage our chances in this race by including students in the overall net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  targets that the government has been trying, increasingly unsuccessfully, to reduce? Why are we clamping down on precisely the temporary \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  that we should be trying to attract? As British ambassador in Japan from 2008-12, promoting higher education was one of my major objectives. I made sure that Japanese colleges and their agents understood the way in which the visa system worked, and that their students had appropriate sponsorship and filled in the forms correctly. The \uc2 UK Border Agency\uc2  officials I dealt with tried to ensure that the mass of genuine students were not deterred by systems and rules aimed at weeding out the tiny number of bogus applicants.\par \par \uc2 But Japan is a relatively small supplier of foreign students. The impact is much greater elsewhere. The number of students from India starting a UK university course has halved over the past two years. Pakistan is down 38% over the same period. The situation would be very different if we adopted a sensible policy and took students out of the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  target. America, not exactly a soft touch on border control, does not include students in its permanent migrant figures. Nor do Canada and Australia. New enrolments of overseas students in America increased by 9.8% last year; in Australia by 8.1%, and in Canada by 3.9%. There is a race, and we are beginning to lose it.\par \par \uc2 This misguided policy is specifically damaging the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) sectors. These subjects are strategically important, but vulnerable. A recent \uc2 Higher Education Funding Council for England\uc2  (HEFCE) report highlighted the extent in which master's level courses were populated by, indeed dependent on, foreign students. But the total of non-EU postgraduate Stem students fell by 20% last year. We should be deeply worried about this.\par \par \uc2 Numerous surveys have shown that legal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  put more into the economy in taxes and wealth-creation than they take out in benefits and using services. A report last year by Oxford Economics and \uc2 Sheffield University\uc2  showed that students are the category of \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  least likely to be a drain on resources: many are young, single and without dependants, as well as likely to be highly skilled. The vast majority return to their countries at the end of their studies.\par \par \uc2 The illogical way in which students are lumped together with permanent migrants is having a destructive impact on Britain's reputation as a world centre for higher education. We are still up there with America as a major destination for foreign students. This will not be true for much longer if we remain in denial about the impact of our policy. It cost us \u163\'00\'A3230m last year. If trends continue, it will cost us \u163\'00\'A3400m in this.\par \par \uc2 There is an alternative. Classify students as temporary migrants, take them out of the targets, and send a clearer message to the world that we want to attract as many as we can \u8212\'20\'14 don't, as we are at present, carry on promoting higher education as an export with one hand tied behind our back. The policy should change.\par \par \uc2 Sir David Warren is the chairman of the Japan Society and chairman-designate of the council of Kent University\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140504ea54000ni\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Fiercely intellectual, 'the black Boris' has been tipped for high office but as a leading figure of the new Tory right unafraid to oppose Cameron he knows he has been 'too voluble' NEWS REVIEW INTERVIEW\par \par \uc2 Kwasi Kwarteng has an extraordinary laugh; a great booming sound that fills Portcullis House in Westminster and makes the cafeteria table vibrate. He unleashes it when he does not want to answer a question \u8212\'20\'14 which is frequently \u8212\'20\'14 eyeing me from behind thick black-framed spectacles, throwing his head back and emitting great guffaws before talking about something else entirely.\par \par \uc2 The 38-year-old Conservative MP for Spelthorne in Surrey has been called "the Black Boris" but reminds me of a self-satisfied Victorian professor. Kwarteng was one of the stars of the 2010 intake of Tory MPs, a former financial analyst with an impeccable academic track record. He has spent his time in parliament carving a name for himself as one of the leading figures in a new Tory right-wing vanguard \u8212\'20\'14 a group of young heirs to Margaret Thatcher whose views often oppose \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's vision of compassionate Conservatism.\par \par \uc2 To say that Kwarteng is intellectually confident is an understatement, but he lacks Boris's selfassurance. He has been known to record interviews to check them for accuracy and keeps crying, "How do you know that? That's never been in print", to questions relating to his non-political past.\par \par \uc2 We are here to talk about his new book, War and Gold, an economic history that explains how our financial systems and institutions have been shaped by war and the need for easy capital \u8212\'20\'14 all the way back to the Spanish conquistadors. The idea came to him at the time of the financial crash. "I was thinking, wouldn't it be good to write a book about what was clearly the financial event of the generation, if not a lifetime" and decided that "if you're trained as a historian, the first question you ask is how did we get where we are".\par \par \uc2 The book explains how governments have always suspended the gold standard and printed money as a way of funding wars. It also lays out Kwarteng's theories for reducing debt \u8212\'20\'14 including "a gold standard based on a fixed exchange rate of yuan [China's currency] to a prescribed quantity of gold".\par \par \uc2 Even if this worked does he believe the cycle of boom and bust can ever stop? "I think it can; it stopped for much of the 19th century. Britain went back on the gold standard in 1821; we were on the gold standard until 1914. There was no reason why, if it hadn't been for the First World War, it would have stopped."\par \par \uc2 This is the third book Kwarteng has published in the four years since he was elected. He claims this is down to "ruthless" efficiency and an excellent "secretary" but actually Kwarteng is just aggressively intellectual; the sort of man who reads Thomas Piketty's bestselling economics book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, "in the original French" and becomes giddy about the National Archives.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps it is because of this that his political career has not quite taken off. In the early days of the coalition he was named as a potential first black Conservative minister. "People touted me but it didn't happen," he says. "I clearly upset some higher-ups, I don't know why, probably too voluble."\par \par \uc2 It may just be that he lacks the common touch. Trying to talk about anything other than economic history feels like petting a spitting cat. "You could ask me that," he snaps at one point. "Ostensibly you are interviewing me about the book."\par \par \uc2 He has carved a niche for himself as an exciting political thinker. Kwarteng describes himself as a Eurosceptic and a free market Conservative. Along with other "ones to watch" from the 2010 intake, including Dominic Raab and Liz Truss, he has published two collaborative books, After the Coalition and Britannia Unchained, proposing a new direction for the Conservative party; advocating free market economics, a smaller state and a more globally competitive Britain. Would he like to see new blood in the party leadership? "It will come," Kwarteng says. "Sajid Javid, Liz Truss; these people are excellent and with time these guys will be at the top of the party."\par \par \uc2 Like others in this group he was heavily influenced by Thatcher. He "vividly" remembers when he was aged 15 that she left Downing Street and a friend who had "posters of her all over his walls" ran out screaming the news. "I couldn't remember any other prime minister, I would have been four when she was elected." He has been "thinking about various aspects" of Thatcher's style and "the challenges she faced". She was, he says, "incomparable and in my mind a very, very strong prime minister".\par \par \uc2 He talks a lot about the need for bold political opinion: "I think Conservatives want clear, well defined positions and perhaps the coalition has meant that the hard simplicity they wanted has been blunted or obscured," he says.\par \par \uc2 He has also pointed out that the public are sick of politicians trying to be something they are not. Is this, I suggest, why Nigel Farage is in such a strong position going into the European elections. "Yes," he agrees. "He likes his beer, his cigarettes, his crazy coats. He has that image, which I'm sure he has cultivated but at the moment it is working well for him." Later he almost goes further: "Someone said to me \u8212\'20\'14 and I'm not saying I agree with it \u8212\'20\'14 that the two major politicians in this country at the moment are Farage and [Alex] Salmond."\par \par \uc2 Kwarteng may not look like a typical Tory, but his upbringing fits the current party mould exactly. His parents are Ghanaian \u8212\'20\'14 his mother was a barrister who became head of chambers at Lincoln's Inn and he describes his father as a "centre left" economist.\par \par \uc2 Kwarteng was an only child and an extremely bright one. Aged eight he boarded at Colet Court in Barnes, southwest London, the feeder school to St Paul's that has been hit by historic sex abuse allegations. He looks uncomfortable when I bring it up but says one of the men implicated, who died three years ago, "was deputy headmaster and was promoted to headmaster in my last term".\par \par \uc2 He describes the school as a "very funny place" where most of the parents lived in London and sent their children to the boarding house he attended "as a lifestyle choice". He remembers that at the time "there were always jokes and dim things in the background".\par \par \uc2 Kwarteng went to Eton "on a full scholarship". Did his parents push him academically? "I think all children of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  have a slight pressure to do well but then you internalise that; I wanted to do well at studies, I quite liked winning prizes." He was "aware" of his race and "having a funny name" and there was "some teasing" but once "you found a skill, people just let you get on with it". For him it was academia.\par \par \uc2 Kwarteng is said to have ended his Cambridge University entrance interview with a nervous young don with the words: "Don't worry, sir, you did a good job." He squirms and says "there may be some truth" in the story. He stayed out of politics at Trinity College, where he studied history and was friends with Tristram Hunt, now the shadow education secretary. After his PhD he applied for two academic fellowships at Cambridge, which he did not get, and then took a job at \uc2 JP Morgan\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He believes banker bashing is "insane" and "the City of London is an integral part of our economy".\par \par \uc2 But he becomes vague about the seven years he spent working as an analyst there \u8212\'20\'14 when City salaries were at their highest \u8212\'20\'14 before becoming an MP.\par \par \uc2 He worked for a time at \uc2 Odey Asset Management\uc2  and is "friends" with Crispin Odey, the fund manager who paid himself \u163\'00\'A328m in 2008 for anticipating the credit crunch. He owns a flat in Bayswater, west London, that he bought "from savings" and says dismissively "it's just a tiny little thing". He clams up when I ask whether he is in a relationship with the Tory MP Amber Rudd. The two are said to have been a couple for more than a year.\par \par \uc2 Does he mind the "Black Boris" label? "Anything people remember me by is fine," he says with a smile. Except, it seems, his Boris-type gaffe: he said "f***" on University Challenge and landed up on page 3 of The Sun, smirking beneath a pair of breasts and the headline "Rudeiversity Challenge". It may have happened in 1995 but he howls like a wounded badger when I bring it up.\par \par \uc2 "It was the softest thing in the world but it's been blown up into some four-letter rant," he cries, head in hands.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps there is a bit of Boris in him after all.\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140504ea54000ma\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

YouGov's poll found that the Tories trounce Labour by two to one when voters were asked who they trust most to keep the economy growing. Labour leads by the same huge margin on making sure ordinary people's wages keep up with inflation.\par \par \uc2 In the long run, the economy and living standards go hand in hand. Millions think differently on these two things. That's why \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  talks about Britain's growth numbers, which are beginning to perk up, while Ed Miliband stresses the "cost of living crisis", which voters feel.\par \par \uc2 In our poll, more think they are worse off than a year ago.\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg hopes voters will think that the best thing the Coalition has done - raising the personal tax allowance to \u163\'00\'A310,000 - was a Lib Dem idea.\par \par \uc2 Ukip's Nigel Farage is gaining ground by blaming our troubles on Europe and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Our poll shows all four party leaders have a message that chimes with voters. But which will have the greatest impact?\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140504ea54000df\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News; Opinion; Columns\par \b \uc2 Not racist, just sick of being ignored\b0\par\par\uc2 CAROLE MALONE   \par \uc2 631 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Mirror\par \uc2 SMIRR\par \uc2 1; National\par 25\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Mirror Group Ltd   \par \par \uc2 OK, so UKIP have got more than their fair share of nutters. There's the racists, the homophobes, the misogynists. They also have blokes who say they really like women but only if they're scrubbing a floor or giving them a good seeing to. But pop into any Tory Party fringe meeting in the Home Counties and you'll hear armies of old boys coming out with exactly that kind of offensive tosh.\par \par \uc2 However, in the weeks leading up to the Euro elections, and when Farage and his party are getting even more flak than usual, the question we have to ask ourselves is why do UKIP have such huge support in this country? Why are their poll ratings sky high despite the slew of embarrassing stories? Why is it predicted they'll take 38 per cent of the vote at this month's Euro elections even though they've been slated as a racist party? And more importantly - why do people who aren't racist support them? And the answer's simple. For years the British people have been bullied by all the mainstream parties who decreed that anyone who dared question \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  or voiced concerns about it should be branded a bigot. And they're sick of it. They're sick of being told that if they complain about our housing lists, our schools and health services being at breaking point, that's also racist.\par \par \uc2 They're sick of being told that being worried about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  makes them disgusting people. And they're sick of being lectured about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  by parties who flung open this country's doors not because they gave a damn about \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , but as a cynical ploy to grab votes. But the real tragedy here is that for decades the British have welcomed people to these shores. They were glad to give them opportunities they didn't have in their own countries, not to mention a safe haven if they needed one.\par \par \uc2 They were rightly proud of their own compassion and kindness.\par \par \uc2 But that changed when their hospitality and their compassion was abused. When successive governments gave priority to the needs of newcomers over those born here or already living and working here. When British jobs were sold cheap to Eastern European \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  willing to work for a pittance. But especially when politicians began slating people's concerns about all of that as racist. The British people aren't and never have been racist but you can't keep telling them they are and be surprised when they tell you to shove it come election time.\par \par \uc2 Farage has tapped into that anger. Instead of insulting the electorate he tells them they're right to be worried. That controlled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  isn't racist. That they aren't disgusting for wanting to limit the numbers coming here.\par \par \uc2 What Farage is doing to get people on side isn't rocket science, yet the sense of it is lost on mainstream parties who only now - when it's too late - have realised that branding huge swathes of the population as bigots when they're not has cost them votes.\par \par \uc2 Yes, UKIP attracts nut jobs and racists.\par \par \uc2 Yes, what some of its members say IS foul and offensive (but mostly stupid). But that's not putting people off. Nothing sticks to Farage and our three main parties have only themselves to blame for that.\par \par \uc2 And whatever success UKIP has is thanks to the arrogance of those parties. And only when their politicians start listening to and respecting the British people's needs might they get some of that respect back in the form of votes.\par \par \uc2 Branding people bigots when they're not costs the main parties votes\par \par \uc2 Document SMIRR00020140504ea54000ae\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Southern voters give Tories a lift\b0\par\par\uc2 TIM ROSS   \par \uc2 2,541 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 3; National\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 A prospective councillor for Ukip has been suspended for offensive comments which Nigel Farage said were "entirely inconsistent" with being a member of the party.\par \par \uc2 Harry Perry, left, posted comments on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  describing \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  as a "gay-loving nutcase", calling Muslims "devil's kids" and homosexuality "an abomination before God".\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage, right, admitted there were "some idiots" in the party and a Ukip spokesman confirmed Mr Perry, who was due to stand for the party in the Offerton ward in Stockport, had been suspended.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage, who was on the campaign trail in Dover, said: "I've never heard of the bloke until last night. What is happening here is the establishment are singling out a handful of unpleasant comments made by Ukip people."\par \par \uc2 A NORTH-SOUTH divide has opened up between Labour and the Conservatives with a year to go until the general election, a poll for The Sunday Telegraph has found.\par \par \uc2 The Tories have edged in front of Labour in the South, while Ed Miliband's party has extended its advantage in the north of England, according to the latest ICM survey of 2,000 people.\par \par \uc2 With 12 months left until polling day, Labour's overall lead has fallen to just one point, with the party now on 32 per cent to the Conservatives' 31 per cent.\par \par \uc2 It is the narrowest lead recorded for Ed Miliband in ICM's Wisdom Index survey since he became Labour leader in 2010.\par \par \uc2 The poll also showed a fall in support for the Liberal Democrats, on 15 per cent, and another boost for Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party, who gained a point to 13 per cent, since the last Wisdom Index was published in February.\par \par \uc2 In the research, conducted on Wednesday and Thursday, pollsters asked more than 2,000 respondents to predict the share of the vote each party would receive, rather than the conventional question of who they would vote for.\par \par \uc2 The method is designed to provide a more accurate picture of public opinion, as it avoids the "emotional baggage" associated with individuals confessing to not intending to vote or supporting an unpopular party.\par \par \uc2 Recent attention has concentrated on the European Parliamentary elections on May 22, in which Ukip is expected to beat the Conservatives into third place.\par \par \uc2 But with 12 months until the general election on May 7, 2015, all the parties will be focused on the battle to form the next government in Westminster.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  is given a boost today by taking a onepoint lead in the South over Labour. In February's Wisdom Index, Labour had a one-point lead over the Tories in the South East and a three-point lead across the South West and Wales.\par \par \uc2 Voters in the North predicted that the Tories would win just 29 per cent of the vote, with Labour on 35per cent. Their counterparts in southern England, however, forecast a 32per cent share of the vote for the Conservatives, a point ahead of Labour.\par \par \uc2 The result will be a further cause for concern in the shadow cabinet. John Denham, a former cabinet minister and one of Mr Miliband's closest allies, admitted last week that Labour had made "a complete hash" of its response to Ukip and was failing to win over the South. One shadow cabinet minister admitted that Labour could not win next year's election without "doing better" in southern areas, while the Tories would not need to convert the North for victory. Today's poll suggests that the Conservatives have retained their advantage over Labour among the over-65 age group, who are among the most likely to turn out to vote.\par \par \uc2 Martin Boon\uc2 , the head of ICM Research, said the result represented the joint narrowest lead for Labour ever recorded in the Wisdom Index.\par \par \uc2 "Both the main parties are polling much lower than they would hope for," he said.\par \par \uc2 "This different polling approach provides further evidence that, at last, the Tories are making inroads into the Labour vote."\par \par \uc2 However, the shift is due to a loss of support for Labour as the Conservatives remain stuck on 31per cent, he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Miliband and Mr Farage will set out their rival offers on the BBC's The \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show today.\par \par \uc2 Some Conservative MPs fear that Labour has been keeping quiet recently to allow Ukip to dominate the political agenda, to the cost of the Tories. "I think Labour are just holding back," one Conservative MP said. "Labour's silence is partly because they are thinking, 'as long as Ukip are in the headlines, that damages the Tories'."\par \par \uc2 Polling in the marginal seats suggests that strong backing for Mr Farage would split the Right-wing vote, taking enough support away from the Tories to allow Labour into power in next year's election.\par \par \uc2 Tories are also concerned that their party is less prepared for the "ground war" over the next 12 months than Labour.\par \par \uc2 Mr Miliband's officials now say their activists have knocked on 1.5million doors in the party's 106 target seat areas since January this year.\par \par \uc2 Labour has installed candidates in 104 of its 106 target seats, while full-time, paid community organisers are also now at work in 102.\par \par \uc2 All that is required for Labour to be the largest party next year - a platform for a potential coalition with Nick Clegg - is a national swing of just 1.75per cent.\par \par \uc2 For the Tories, the picture appears less clear. Analysis by this newspaper suggests that they have so far failed to choose candidates in almost a third of their top target seats.\par \par \uc2 While Mr Miliband has 98 per cent of his parliamentary candidates already in place, the Conservatives have vacancies in up to 30 per cent of their most winnable marginal seats.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron has authorised what is known as the "40/40 strategy" for winning next year's election.\par \par \uc2 Under the plan, Tory resources will be concentrated on the 40 constituencies with sitting MPs on small majorities - the so-called "defensive" seats - and the 40 "attack" seats, which are held by Labour and Lib Dem MPs and which the party regards as the most winnable next year.\par \par \uc2 No official list has been publicly released by the Conservatives of their top 40 target seats. However, Telegraph analysis of the 40 constituencies where the Tories need the smallest swing in support to win, showed candidates have been chosen in only 28 out of these 40 seats so far.\par \par \uc2 Of the 75 most marginal seats with the smallest Labour or Lib Dem majorities, almost half - 34 - still have not chosen a Conservative contender. Andrew Bridgen, the Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire, said: "How can you attack if you haven't even got a candidate in place? There is no focal point. You can't put leaflets out. This needs to be done otherwise how can you make an impact on the ground in less than 12 months?" Janet Daley: Page 24 Matthew d'Ancona: Page 24 IN NEWS REVIEW Iain Martin on why a vote for Ukip could be a vote for Miliband: Page 23 FRASER NELSON Who will be Prime Minister - and why? Right now, Ed Miliband is looking more likely. Not because he's a genius, but because the odds are stacked so heavily in Labour's favour. It's very close, and this could change. But the election is his to lose.\par \par \uc2 What will be their majority? I'd guess less than 30.\par \par \uc2 Who will be the star of the campaign? A voter, perhaps an old lady in a shopping mall who clearly, and succinctly, explains to Miliband why his policies would be a calamity for Britain.\par \par \uc2 What will be the big issues? The economy, debt, cost of living. And inequality is fast coming up inside.\par \par \uc2 Any surprises? Always. Election campaigns are defined by what goes wrong.\par \par \uc2 How will Ukip do? The $3m question. I don't have the foggiest, and don't know anyone who claims to have the foggiest.\par \par \uc2 Will Boris be in Parliament? Without a doubt. It's a staging post. He's a US citizen, so the Senate will be his next stop.\par \par \uc2 JANET DALEY Who will be Prime Minister - and why? \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , because he looks, and sounds, like a Prime Minister, even if what he says isn't what you want to hear - unlike Ed Miliband who can't even do a plausible impersonation of a Leader of the Opposition and is encumbered with Ed Balls.\par \par \uc2 What will be their majority? Between 4 and 10 seats.\par \par \uc2 Who will be the star of the campaign? Probably Cameron himself if he pulls out some hidden resources and a convincing sense of mission. This could be the secret campaign theme: Cameron as you've never seen him before. To compete for stardom with Boris, he has to play "The Serious One" versus "The Entertaining One".\par \par \uc2 What will be the big issues? Economic recovery, tax - especially for the middle class - and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Any surprises? By definition, this is impossible to predict.\par \par \uc2 How will Ukip do? Certainly better than the Lib Dems as a proportion of the national vote, but still no seats.\par \par \uc2 DAN HODGES Who will be Prime Minister - and why? \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 . He's failed to complete his modernisation of the Tory brand, but he's got most of the big decisions - especially on the economy - right. And he is not Ed Miliband.\par \par \uc2 What will be their majority? Tories. By 20 to 30 seats. Labour's disastrous 35 per cent strategy means it's virtually impossible for them to win now.\par \par \uc2 Who will be the star of the campaign? Some housewife from Tyne and Wear who will harangue one of the party leaders over the price of Brussels sprouts.\par \par \uc2 What will be the big issues? There will be three main issues. The economy. The economy. And the economy.\par \par \uc2 Any surprises? Quite a few people will be surprised at the Tories winning. Many of them Tory MPs.\par \par \uc2 How will Ukip do? Very badly - 5 to 6 per cent and no seats. I've pledged to streak naked down Whitehall if Nigel Farage breaks 6 per cent, which is the final nail in Ukip's coffin.\par \par \uc2 MARY RIDDELL Who will be Prime Minister - and why? Ed Miliband. Because he'll have put together an offer that convinces richer people that he'll improve society and poorer people that they will be the beneficiaries.\par \par \uc2 What will be their majority? The days of landslides are over, but I forecast a workable overall majority, with 347 Labour seats.\par \par \uc2 Who will be the star of the campaign? Hopefully, inspiring people from outside the mould. Rob Halfon, the Tory MP for Harlow, who champions blue-collar workers, or Sophy Gardner, Labour's candidate in Gloucester, a past RAF wing commander who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 What will be the big issues? The economy, living standards, housing, the \uc2 NHS\uc2 , \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - and Europe as a sub-strand.\par \par \uc2 Any surprises? Nick Clegg looks vulnerable in Sheffield.\par \par \uc2 How will Ukip do? Much less well than Nigel Farage might think. I'd say they'll get less than 10 per cent of the vote - though Farage may get a seat.\par \par \uc2 MATTHEW D'ANCONA Who will be Prime Minister - and why? \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , because his record is sufficiently strong, Ukip will have peaked and Ed Miliband, though much more impressive than I thought in 2010, is insufficiently prime ministerial in bearing.\par \par \uc2 What will be their majority? Small and possibly non-existent - don't rule out a coalition.\par \par \uc2 Who will be the star of the campaign? Boris, if he stands as an MP (as he should).\par \par \uc2 What will be the big issues? The economy, of course, but also the character of the recovery. Is it truly national or statistical and of little relevance to most people? Labour will try to tempt Cameron to go too far on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Any surprises? Osborne will be deployed more than in 2010 as the face of resilience. There will be a row about the "race card" and at least one big drugs story. Tory splits over Europe will appear.\par \par \uc2 How will Ukip do? Badly in their attempt to win seats. But they could hand plenty of marginals to Labour.\par \par \uc2 SUE CAMERON Who will be Prime Minister - and why? Ed Miliband will be PM in a LibLab coalition. The Tories stand to be the largest party, but they will be cheated of an overall majority because unreformed constituency boundaries give Labour an inbuilt advantage. Even smallscale Ukip support will lose the Tories seats in some marginals. Left-leaning Lib Dem grass roots who hate being in coalition with the Tories may defect to Labour and won't countenance another Tory/Lib Dem coalition. The voters will be nervous about a Miliband premiership, because of questions about his competence on the economy and because of his image. He's beginning to sound not just nerdy, but unctuous.\par \par \uc2 What will be their majority? No overall majority for one party.\par \par \uc2 Who will be the star of the campaign? Boris, Nigel Farage and Tessa Jowell. Dame Tessa will be limbering up for the London mayoral elections. With her mixture of charm and steel, Labour would be mad not to give her a starring role. Boris is always a star and Nasty Nige could yet hold the ring, even if Ukip fails to win seats itself.\par \par \uc2 CHARLES MOORE Who will be Prime Minister - and why? \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , because, unlike in 2010, he has something to say. Labour does not.\par \par \uc2 What will be their majority? If overall, very small. It will probably require a coalition.\par \par \uc2 Who will be the star of the campaign? Nigel Farage, I suppose, because he is naughty and new.\par \par \uc2 What will be the big issues? Is the return of prosperity real for most people? Will we have a referendum on the \uc2 European Union\uc2 ? Any surprises? The very nature of surprises means by answering this it wouldn't be surprising.\par \par \uc2 How will Ukip do? I think they will do less well than in the European elections, but they will make an impression across the country both for Labour and the Conservatives.\par \par \uc2 Will Boris be in Parliament? If he says no, you can assume that he will.\par \par \uc2 JEREMY WARNER Who will be Prime Minister - and why? \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , because an improving economy will come to his rescue and voters don't trust Ed Miliband to run the country.\par \par \uc2 What will be their majority? Marginal at best. There would have to be a monumental turnaround in the polls for the Tories to win a big majority.\par \par \uc2 Who will be the star of the campaign? Unlikely though it may seem, \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 , who may be a somewhat cold figure, but has earned considerable respect for his handling of the economy.\par \par \uc2 What will be the big issues? The economy, inequality/living standards, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Europe only an issue in so far as it affects the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate. Otherwise it is irrelevant.\par \par \uc2 Any surprises? Biggest upset would be caused by a "yes" vote in the Scottish referendum. Cameron would feel obliged to resign, significant economic uncertainties would be created and it would raise big questions about the length of the next parliament.\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140504ea5400099\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Good new for the Tories: they can win\b0\par\par\uc2 440 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 25\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Our latest poll brings \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  some good news: the Tories are only one point behind Labour. Coming just 12 months before the next election, Labour's rapidly diminishing lead ought to give Mr Cameron encouragement. He can win.\par \par \uc2 We have asked our political columnists to make predictions about 2015 and they, too, offer reasons to be cheerful. Five out of eight say that Mr Cameron will triumph. Everyone thinks Boris Johnson either will be in Parliament, or should be. There is some dispute as to how important Ukip will prove. Fraser Nelson's tip for a likely "star" of the campaign is "an old lady in a shopping mall who clearly, and succinctly, explains to [Ed] Miliband why his policies would be a calamity for Britain".\par \par \uc2 But a true-blue tomorrow is still far from guaranteed. All those columnists predicting a Cameron win reckon that the majority will be small, which reflects Labour's inbuilt advantage in seats and the mixed experience of economic recovery. Indeed, there is a growing North/South divide, suggesting that standards of living are perhaps not rising equally as fast across the country. Our poll shows that the Tories have nudged ahead in the South of England but are behind by six significant points in the North.\par \par \uc2 Philosophical conservatism is not the problem: previous polls of Northern voters have shown enormous support for controlling \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  or making sensible savings in the welfare bill. The divide might be down to varying degrees of consumer confidence. A housing boom in the South could be engendering a happier spirit than that found in the North. The perennial challenge of the Tory image problem could also be at play - the idea that Mr Cameron just does not care about those living north of Watford. Of course, that impression is nonsense. Conservatism is truly "one-nation", in the sense of being above class and sectional interests and acting to serve the needs of all the people, wherever they might live. The Conservatives might bridge their North/South divide if they start floating ideas that will help as many people as possible to benefit from the recovery, as Matthew d'Ancona suggests in these pages.\par \par \uc2 We have long made the case for tax cuts that would have the benefit of giving workers more control over the money they earn, helping the economy to grow, and showing that voting Tory reduces the cost of living. That strategy is also far better than Mr Miliband's big-state approach - as Mr Nelson's "old lady in a shopping mall" would doubtless tell us.\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140504ea540007h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 Features; Review\par \b \uc2 WOULD A VOTE FOR THIS MAN RUIN BRITAIN?\b0\par\par\uc2 Iain Martin   \par \uc2 1,777 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 One year before the general election, Tories fear that a surge in popularity for Ukip could end up handing power to Ed Miliband, says Iain Martin\par \par \uc2 With the Tories uncertain how to handle the Ukip surge, on the campaign trail last week, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  tried a little humour. On Friday he mocked the propensity of Nigel Farage's party to get into scrapes that would doom other parties: "I don't need to discredit Ukip. They have done a good enough job of that over the last few weeks."\par \par \uc2 If Mr Cameron hoped that his joke would suggest insouciance and boundless prime ministerial selfconfidence, it is Ukip that is laughing all the way to the European elections.\par \par \uc2 Not only do the recent suggestions of racism and financial chicanery seem to have bounced off Ukip, the publicity seems only to have boosted the party's rebellious reputation. The renegades, riding a wave of popular discontent with the mainstream parties, have even charged into the lead in opinion polls ahead of the "Euros" later this month.\par \par \uc2 Then, last week, the former Tory MP Patrick Mercer presented Ukip leader Nigel Farage with another golden opportunity. Following a parliamentary inquiry into revelations that he had agreed to take cash for asking questions in the Commons, Mr Mercer announced that he would stand down and trigger an awkward by-election for the Conservatives.\par \par \uc2 In Newark, the Tories are defending a majority of more than 16,000 votes, which theoretically should make the seat safe. However, in the current febrile atmosphere, with voters looking for ways to kick the established parties, and with Mr Farage on the rampage, anything is possible.\par \par \uc2 At least the Tories will not have to face Mr Farage himself as a candidate on June 5. Fearing the consequences if he gambled and failed to win Ukip its first Commons seat, he announced that the party would choose a candidate with a local connection instead. That way Mr Farage still gets his fun without risking personal defeat. After the Euros on May 22, he can dedicate himself to campaigning for his party's Newark candidate and mining the anti-Tory publicity like mad. Mr Farage suspected that if he stood himself and lost, it would be reported as the bursting of the bubble.\par \par \uc2 But once Newark is over, what impact will the Ukip surge have on the general election taking place a year this week?\par \par \uc2 The dawning realisation is that when the European elections and the by-election are out of the way, the Ukip advance threatens a large number of Conservative seats at the general election. Although it remains unlikely that Ukip will win many - or even any - Westminster seats next year, it looks set to do tremendous damage to the Tories merely by taking sufficient numbers of votes in individual seats and letting Labour through. This could easily give Ed Miliband a majority, or at least make Labour the largest party in a hung parliament.\par \par \uc2 Tory MPs in marginal seats, with small majorities, are looking with nervousness at the rise of Ukip. It has been received wisdom that Mr Farage's party will slip back when voters concentrate on the general election and the choice between \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and Ed Miliband. But what if Ukip has reached such a level of support that, even if it does subside somewhat, it will settle eventually at a level high enough in 2015 to gift the election to Labour?\par \par \uc2 This way, almost by accident, thanks to Tory electoral failure and the rise of Ukip, Britain could end up getting a very Left-wing government led by the unpopular Mr Miliband.\par \par \uc2 One Tory MP said: "Ironically, just when people are saying that there is no difference between the parties, there is actually quite a big difference this time. Miliband has a pretty extreme agenda."\par \par \uc2 Mr Miliband is certainly less friendly to business than his predecessors \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  and Tony Blair were when they were fighting for power in the mid-Nineties. The Tories point out that Labour under Mr Miliband is already committed to reinstating the 50p tax band and freezing energy prices. The party is also open to the possibility of further wealth taxes. And last week, Mr Miliband unveiled plans aimed at dealing with alleged market failure, pledging to place new restrictions on the private housing market for renting.\par \par \uc2 Despite little evidence that rents are soaring, as Labour claims, the party will create limits to prevent what it deems "excessive increases" and create the right to longer tenancies.\par \par \uc2 The restrictions could persuade some landlords of a smaller number of properties to sell up. Reducing the supply of properties for rent, or concentrating control in the hands of fewer landlords, will tend to increase prices.\par \par \uc2 Tory headquarters accused Labour of adopting measures like those favoured by the Left-wing Marxist Venezuelan government. Even if that was an extreme characterisation, Mr Miliband seems incapable of seeing an area of private activity without intervening with a fiddly piece of statist micromanagement. It was a glimpse of the approach the Tories say Mr Miliband will adopt if he becomes Prime Minister.\par \par \uc2 "If he gets in, you can kiss goodbye to the recovery. People need to understand he'll tax and regulate it out of existence," says a Tory aide.\par \par \uc2 The prospect of defeat and the likely socialist predilections of a Labour government are increasingly preoccupying Tory ministers and MPs. And as is often the case ahead of a close-fought general election, attention centres on the most vulnerable seats as MPs start to ask if they will have a job after the electoral storm.\par \par \uc2 In the top 25 Tory-held seats most at risk, there are plenty in which even a small increase in the Ukip vote could hand Labour victory.\par \par \uc2 Even before Mr Farage's party began to increase its support, the challenge facing the Tories at the next election is enormous. The unreformed boundaries mean Labour starts with an advantage, and considerable numbers of those who voted Liberal Democrat in 2010 have since returned to the Labour fold. Now the Conservatives have to worry about Ukip as well.\par \par \uc2 Bedford, which the Tories narrowly took from Labour in 2010, illustrates the dilemma. Richard Fuller won with a majority of 1,353 and Ukip came fourth with just 1,136 votes (2.5 per cent of the vote). If Labour take votes from the Lib Dems and Ukip merely doubles its 2010 vote, it will be all but impossible for the Tories to hold on.\par \par \uc2 Enfield North in London is another such seat. Nick de Bois has a majority over Labour of 1,692 and Ukip came fifth behind the British National Party last time. Even a relatively small boost for Ukip could help to dislodge the Tories and turn the seat Labour again.\par \par \uc2 Nationally, Mr Farage is performing in polls at levels that suggest the party could more than double its share of the vote in target seats. Even in the 2010 election, Ukip managed to get 3.1 per cent of the vote, despite Mr Farage not being leader and the party attracting little attention. It is now consistently polling above 12 per cent in opinion polls.\par \par \uc2 Says a Tory MP: "Ukip is not going to get 3 per cent of the vote next time. In the end, it will be more like 7 per cent or 8 per cent. We are stuffed if that happens."\par \par \uc2 Prof John Curtice, one of Britain's leading psephologists, called it "almost inconceivable" that Ukip could sink back to 3.1 per cent of the national vote.\par \par \uc2 "Given how high Ukip support has been and for how long, it is difficult to see how the genie can go all the way back in the bottle."\par \par \uc2 Part of the difficulty for the Tories may be that some of the new Ukip voters they need to woo back are not convinced that they or their children are benefiting personally from the economic recovery, he adds.\par \par \uc2 So far, the Tories have struggled in their attempts to convince such voters that Mr Cameron understands their concerns. Mr Farage - with his populist position on restricting \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - is ideally positioned to win the support of those who feel left behind.\par \par \uc2 "It's about personality, too. They don't see any difference between Cameron and Miliband," says a Tory rebel.\par \par \uc2 Another Tory MP was more sanguine. "There isn't much we can do about this Ukip thing for the European elections. It has to blow itself out and then we see where we get to after Newark. After that, it is a choice between us and Ed Miliband."\par \par \uc2 A veteran Labour MP agreed that Ukip will slide: "They'll easily get over 30 per cent of the vote in the Euro elections and then they'll be back at 5 per cent this time next year. I think we're looking at a small outright Tory majority."\par \par \uc2 The Tories must pray he is right. On Friday, the Prime Minister travelled to North Staffordshire ostensibly to launch the Tories' local election campaign. He highlighted the economic recovery, although the main target of his remarks was Ukip and the voters who are defecting. He repeated his pledge of a renegotiation of the terms of membership of the EU and then an in-out referendum if he wins the general election.\par \par \uc2 "To those people who say you won't deliver on that renegotiation or on that referendum, I say: judge me by my record as prime minister. Others talk about acting in the national interest or about standing up to Europe, I do it, time and again. People said I would never veto a European treaty. In 2011, that's exactly what I did. People said my attempts to cut the European budget would fail. I secured that cut.\par \par \uc2 "I have a track record of delivery. Believe me, whatever it takes, I will deliver this inout referendum. Labour won't. Ukip can't. I will."\par \par \uc2 Unsurprisingly, Ukip rejects this analysis. The party is being carried along by a populist surge of discontent and its leading figures are enjoying the discomfort of the established parties. They think it can sweep them all the way to a position where the UK gets out of the EU.\par \par \uc2 Unless Mr Cameron's message cuts through to Ukip supporters, and the Tories can secure their allegiance, electoral victory may well belong to the most Left-wing Labour leader in more than 30 years.\par \par \uc2 "If Miliband gets in, you can kiss goodbye to recovery. Hell tax it out of existence\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140504ea540005a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 Down to earth, with a good sense of humour\b0\par\par\uc2 Francine Raymond   \par \uc2 1,617 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 16,17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Gardening Against the Odds recognises those who create beauty in the face of adversity. This year, a new award nods to creations that inspire a smile, writes Francine Raymond\par \par \uc2 The Great Conservatory at Syon Park, bursting with metre-high Geranium maderense and joyful with the chatter of young gardeners, last week played host to our fourth Gardening Against the Odds awards presentation. The awards, organised by The Sunday Telegraph and The \uc2 Conservation Foundation\uc2  highlight the efforts of those who create beautiful gardens, despite personal difficulties.\par \par \uc2 The overall winner for 2013, Chris Evans, reminded us that the Butterfly Garden Project in Cheltenham started with just six students but, 11 years later, numbers had spiralled: "When we heard we'd won, it was difficult to leave anyone behind, so 60 of us are here to accept the award."\par \par \uc2 He added: "Elspeth Thompson [The Telegraph gardening writer], in whose memory these awards are given, knew how magical gardening can be. You decide to garden and people come to look, then someone will speak to you, another will ask what you're doing, a third will come back the next day to watch and, in no time, you have friendships. Off the back of that friendship a new community is born."\par \par \uc2 Their award was like a seed and the Butterfly Garden is already cross-pollinating with the winners of the Young Gardener category: Dost, a centre for young \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and refugees, and Ricky Downey, an apprentice gardener. Last Thursday, Chris received his British Empire Medal. He had a brooch made up and reproduced a similar award for every one of his students, all to be presented by the Lord Lieutenant.\par \par \uc2 THE 2014 AWARDS\par \par \uc2 Over the coming year, the Gardening Against the Odds awards will continue to celebrate those who battle against physical and mental odds, but we are also introducing a new category - Gardens that Make You Smile - highlighting exuberant gardens with generosity of spirit that uplift and make life better for those who view them.\par \par \uc2 Those who smile live longer. It has been proved that smiling boosts our immune systems, changes our mood, lowers blood pressure and can even act as a natural facelift, so if gardens can add to our wellbeing, why not promote their benefits and reward our benefactors? In the meantime, their creators are receiving their own health bonus through exercise and fresh air. Just imagine how much better life could be if all front gardens displayed a little wit among the usual plants and shrubs.\par \par \uc2 Katy Cox's end-of-terrace garden in Faversham is a prime example. When I visited last week I was entranced with her horticultural whimsy. Vegetables grow happily in old tin trunks; succulents succeed in tiny jewellery cases (and, more surprisingly, in plastic dinosaurs that lurk in window boxes packed with ferns); and tin cans of alpines balance in precarious Fifties wirework among surrealistic marine creatures - all to seduce passers-by. Katy makes fruit preserves and liqueurs (from mightyfinethings.co. uk) and organises a monthly street market (favershammarket.org). She will also show her garden as part of Faversham Open Gardens on June 29.\par \par \uc2 Another such gardener is Marilyn Phipps, who welcomes visitors to her beach-house venue with an old \uc2 Lloyd Loom\uc2  chair that has seen better days. Instead of ending up in the skip, this venerable old resting place displays a selection of small pot plants nestling in its exposed springs. To Marilyn, gardening is a form of self-expression, a creative way of pleasing. But it's not just horticultural jokes that please: I pass a front garden on my way to the station that's just so charming, it always makes me smile as I hurry to catch my train.\par \par \uc2 The most innovative and amusing gardens can be found in the concrete jungle of the city. When east London "Pothole Gardener" Steve Wheen wanted to brighten up his grey neighbourhood, "gardening came to mind", he says. So, for the past three years, he has been filling holes in the road with compost and plants, and adding tiny features "to bring happiness in unexpected places" (see The Little Book of Little Gardens and his website thepotholegardener.co.uk).\par \par \uc2 Apart from drawing attention to the potholes, Steve's greatest reward is to sit back and watch the public's reaction to his ephemeral miniature gardens.\par \par \uc2 In north London, architect and hedge-cutter Tim Bushe turns boundaries into common ground. After he fulfilled his wife's request to sculpt his own privet hedges into a cat, neighbours he had never met before made contact. Local landmarks such as his famous Highbury herd of elephants make people stop, smile and socialise. And he uses his fees to support a charity that helps people with learning difficulties (hft.org.uk, formerly the \uc2 Home Farm Trust\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 Such ideas have blossomed in recent years. Telegraph writer and Gardening Against the Odds judge Tim Richardson thought up the Chelsea Fringe as a way of bringing together the myriad community gardening projects that spring up around London. "The idea of the Fringe is to give a platform for these projects to promote themselves and give an annual focus for celebrations," he says. Success is obvious, with increasing numbers of gardeners taking part, and satellite fringes springing up in Bristol, Brighton and Kent, as well as abroad (see chelseafringe.com).\par \par \uc2 Tim describes the Fringe, running this year from May 17 through to June 8, as "street fashion" to the "haute couture" of Chelsea proper. Last year, Anna Rose Hughes's garden in a converted lavatory block in Peckham, just a corridor's width, incorporated the site's original sinks packed with dripping asplenium, athyrium, dryopteris and polystichum ferns. This kind of irreverence proves gardeners have a sense of humour.\par \par \uc2 Humour doesn't feature widely in mainstream Chelsea gardens, but a memorable exception in 2006 was Marney Hall's 4head Garden of Dreams; an idyllic retreat home to thousands of healing plants, and the flower show's largest plant sculpture \u8212\'20\'14 a reclining female figure clothed in a variety of grasses and mosses.\par \par \uc2 Since one's own garden rarely evokes a smile, it's up to us to nominate the gardens of others. Send us examples of gardeners whose efforts bring a smile to your face, and spread the joy.\par \par \uc2 For details of how to enter, see panel, right, go to telegraph.co.uk/ gardeningawards or gardeningagainst theodds.com.\par \par \uc2 WHAT IS GARDENING AGAINST THE ODDS?\par \par \uc2 Gardeners against the odds make their own lives and the lives of others brighter, better and more fun through their efforts to create beautiful garden spaces.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Marriage died last week after a long illness. There will still be weddings, of course. But they won\u8217\'20\'19t mean anything any more. They\u8217\'20\'19ll be like those certificates saying you are \u8216\'20\'18Lord of the Manor\u8217\'20\'19 which gullible Americans buy.\par \par \uc2 The whole point of marriage was that it was binding for life \u8211\'20\'13 \u8216\'20\'18for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death us\u160\'00\'A0 do part\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 That is what made it such a fortress against other influences. The State couldn\u8217\'20\'19t break into it. It was a small, private place where we were sovereign over our own lives.\par \par \uc2 Either you like this or you don\u8217\'20\'19t. I believe that raising children as well as we can is the central purpose of our lives. I also think that lifelong marriage is the best way of doing\u160\'00\'A0 it, and of ensuring that we do not run away from it, as many of us are inclined to do.\par \par \uc2 I also think the greatest test of character most of us will face will come when a husband or wife falls ill and becomes dependent on us. Marriage, by leaving us no choice in this, actually makes it easier.\par \par \uc2 But in the late 1960s, Britain and most other Western countries introduced divorce laws that\u160\'00\'A0 hollowed out the\u160\'00\'A0 marriage oath.\par \par \uc2 Since then, if either spouse wishes to break the solemn marriage promise, the State and the law actively take that spouse\u8217\'20\'19s side.\par \par \uc2 If the other half of the marriage wishes to stay married, he or she can in the end be removed from the home by force, with the threat of prison.\par \par \uc2 I am still amazed that this totalitarian change came about with so little protest.\par \par \uc2 Now the very sharp and influential Sir James Munby, senior judge in the English family courts, has said that couples should be able to end a marriage simply by signing a form at a register office, with no need for lawyers or judges.\par \par \uc2 And, being smart, he has also urged the next obvious step \u8211\'20\'13 that cohabiting couples should be treated as if they are\u160\'00\'A0 officially married once they have stayed together for a\u160\'00\'A0 couple of years.\par \par \uc2 After all, why not? There\u8217\'20\'19s no important difference any more. Official forms long ago stopped referring to \u8216\'20\'18husband\u8217\'20\'19 or \u8216\'20\'18wife\u8217\'20\'19, and those who cling to these archaic terms are frequently told by bureaucrats that they are now in fact \u8216\'20\'18partners\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 I think Sir James will get his wish. And everyone will be happy, happy, happy \u8211\'20\'13 except the growing multitude of children who have never known domestic security and now never will, and the lonely,\u160\'00\'A0 confused old men and women with nowhere to turn but the doubtful comforts of the care home, where their lives can dribble away in a medicated haze, perhaps punctuated by slaps and insults.\par \par \uc2 Another BBC series that needs subtitles (but this time they have a good excuse)\par \par \uc2 Since even home-made BBC productions need subtitles these days, I am surprised the Corporation hasn\u8217\'20\'19t been making more of its powerful new German-made mini-series on the Second World War as experienced by \u8216\'20\'18normal\u8217\'20\'19 Germans.\par \par \uc2 By the time you read this, you\u8217\'20\'19ll probably have already missed two episodes of Generation War but it\u8217\'20\'19s well worth catching up on iPlayer, or perhaps they could repeat it soon. It convulsed Germany when it was shown there last year.\par \par \uc2 It also infuriated Poles, who reasonably thought that it wasn\u8217\'20\'19t for the Germans, of all people, to remind them that quite a lot of Poles had been anti-Semites.\par \par \uc2 But it\u8217\'20\'19s worth seeing for lots of reasons. First, it is simply good TV, never boring, full of incident, some of it horrible, some of it deeply unlikely, but all of it interesting.\par \par \uc2 If you think modern Germans have fully confronted the horrors of the Hitler era, this drama will show you how very wrong you are. They\u8217\'20\'19ve barely begun.\par \par \uc2 This helps to explain Berlin\u8217\'20\'19s continuing desire to advance coyly behind the smokescreen of the \uc2 European Union\uc2  rather than under its own flag. You might also notice that the film completely ignores the first two years of the war, and only begins with the invasion of, er, Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 One simple question will tell us all we need to know about drugs\par \par \uc2 I see that even the slow learners in the media are at last picking up on the mountains of reputable research which show that \u8216\'20\'18antidepressants\u8217\'20\'19 are vastly over-prescribed even on their own terms, often have unpleasant side effects, and may not actually be any more effective against \u8216\'20\'18depression\u8217\'20\'19 than sugar pills.\par \par \uc2 Others all eventually follow where this column has led for years, though, of course, they never admit it.\par \par \uc2 So here\u8217\'20\'19s a new challenge for the slow learners. I cannot see how anyone can oppose it. Can we please now have a\u160\'00\'A0 simple rule for all coroners, magistrates\u160\'00\'A0 and judges?\par \par \uc2 Wherever someone has taken his own life, or wherever someone is accused of taking someone else\u8217\'20\'19s life, or of an act of dangerous violence, the police, doctors and pathologists involved should be required to discover whether that person has ever been a user of mind-altering drugs, whether legally prescribed, or illegal.\par \par \uc2 I believe that if this question is asked, it will become plain that there is a frightening correlation between such drugs and such acts. Then, at last, we can do something.\par \par \uc2 Have you noticed how the BBC discusses UKIP as if it is a problem rather than a legitimate party? Have you observed the pathetic attempts of Tory spin-doctors (who can think of nothing to say in favour of their own organisation) to smear UKIP from morn till night?\par \par \uc2 Have you also noticed the slavish obedience of political journalists, who have spent the past ten years ignoring the biggest issues in British politics \u8211\'20\'13 the EU and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 but now recycle these trivial slanders in the hope that they can save the old, dying parties which have spoon-fed them all their stories?\par \par \uc2 This sort of ganging up has not worked on the Scots, who understandably grow fonder of independence with every stupid threat and falsehood. I have a feeling it\u8217\'20\'19s not going to work on the English either \u8211\'20\'13 and in case you hadn\u8217\'20\'19t noticed by now, Nigel Farage\u160\'00\'A0 is in fact England\u8217\'20\'19s answer to Alex Salmond.\par \par \uc2 If anyone is charged, tried and convicted for the murder of Jean McConville during the Irish Troubles, what will happen to that person? If I\u160\'00\'A0 have correctly understood the 1998 Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act, my belief is that he or she would serve a maximum prison sentence of two years. When I asked the \uc2 Northern Ireland Office\uc2  if I was right, they issued a panicky refusal to comment.\par \par \uc2 If you want to comment on this article, please {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2014/03/goves-latest-lesson-for-parents-how-to-cheat-the-school-system.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 click here}}}\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140504ea540000j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw337\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5055\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Feature | NATURE WATCH Ah, spring: the trees in blossom, the flowers in bloom, the birds in fine voice. Which trees, flowers and birds? Most of us wouldn't have the first clue, admits Emma Townshend - and it's high time we did something about it\par \par \uc2 In terms of knowing about wildlife, we may all start equal, but some of us are more equal than others. I was once standing with Sion (a friend educated at a nature-loving Rudolf Steiner school) on a driveway in suburban west London, at the end of a hot summer's afternoon of garage clearance. I looked at the Tarmac by my feet, saw a slightly disgusting, entirely two-dimensional corpse and declared: "Eww! A squashed frog!"\par \par \uc2 I was staring at the flat, dried-up remains as Sion ambled over. He gave the dead body his full measure of contemplative thought, standing over it with his hands behind his back like he was doing the thing's funeral. And after a minute, he said, "Hmm, no," in his characteristically thoughtful manner. "No, no. That's definitely a toad."\par \par \uc2 I never forgot his easy confidence in the face of something with the texture, essentially, of \uc2 the British Museum\uc2  Lindow Bog Man. And I remember it as spring erupts into life this year.\par \par \uc2 Birdsong pours into the street (somewhat earlier in the morning than we'd like), wild flowers fill the country lanes, and strange creatures get stuck in our hair as we try to take our green waste to the tip. But not all of us have the Steiner education nor the patient absorption of a Sion, both of which are needed to produce the sort of nature lover who can identify any of these phenomena. Most of us can just about manage an "Ooh look, it's a seagull." But Greater? Lesser? Black-backed? Herring? It's anyone's guess. As for that weird green insect crawling at an alarming pace across the dashboard, seriously, I want that thing out the car before we discuss it.\par \par \uc2 But should we care if we can't tell the difference between a frog and a toad - especially when it's squashed? In fact, do most of us have any chance of naming what we see in a normal day around the world? And does it matter?\par \par \uc2 The answer, I'd argue, is yes, yes, yes. Dawn Isaac, the enthusiastic author of 2014's stand-out 101 Things for Kids to Do Outside, agrees. "I do actually think," says Dawn, "that it's bloody important to know the names of species. Not for the sake of amassing facts but because knowing the name of anything means you suddenly notice it more. Tell someone the difference between stretcher bond, English garden wall and Flemish bond, and brick patterns will leap out at them. Watch a couple of episodes of Tractor Ted and you'll suddenly see obscure farm machinery at every turn."\par \par \uc2 I know what she means about Tractor Ted, weirdly. A burst of enthusiasm for the kids' TV series in our house a couple of years ago and suddenly I knew my forage harvesters from my combines; and for the first time in my life, as a direct consequence, I understood a little bit about the arc of the farming year.\par \par \uc2 Knowing the names is the essential first step; it's the basis of everything else. Once you know the names, you have an underpinned structure from which to hang your experience of the world; without the names, everything just slips past you in a motorway fog.\par \par \uc2 The big problem, then, is clear: it's really difficult to start when you know nothing. And it is undoubtedly hard to identify things from pictures in books. A friend of mine described the nature identification gift set sitting on his kitchen window sill, waiting for the mythical moment of peace when he would finally have time to sit down and acquire the knowledge contained within. But even in your own street, garden or park, there are plenty of chances to ramp up your encounter with wild nature and identify what's in front of you like an old pro.\par \par \uc2 I might not be quite of Sion's high standards, but I can tell a sparrowhawk from a falcon, cow parsley from angelica - and here's my short guide to learning the bloody names\u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 Fauna\par \par \uc2 Inevitably, animals are more interesting to most adults and children - and fortunately two of modern life's most distracting devices, smartphones and tablets, provide a key way to maximising your fauna identification skills, with brilliant sites and apps devised by conservation groups and big institutions alike. One of the best providers is Nature Guides, which began with UK birds, but now offers a range from "Damselflies and Dragonflies" to "Bumblebees" (\u163\'00\'A39.99 each, iTunes).\par \par \uc2 Armed with smartphone or not, a garden dig around will soon start to reveal minibeasts such as woodlice, beetles, and caterpillars, as well as the larvae of bigger critters such as ladybirds. Ladybird larvae are particularly good to show to kids because there's a story of growth there which appeals to them. See ladybird-survey.org for a useful PDF chart.\par \par \uc2 Give big leafy plants a shake and look out for shield bugs, which appeal to knight-loving children due to their distinctive shield-like shape. Our native bugs have a little brown patch at the tail, whereas foreign \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  in southern England are completely green; now there's a little discussion you can save for dinner about invasive species. Bees are another good place to start identification practice - bumblebees are beginning to fly now, and are big enough to get a good look. Try the Natural History Museum's free Bumblebee ID guide ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 http://bit.ly/}}}\uc2  1fevUmZ), which is clear and utterly usable.\par \par \uc2 Those noisy birds, as previously mentioned, are singing in the hope of a mate at the moment, so there's lots of warbling about. If you can see them, taking a photo with a digital camera can often help reduce valuable identification time. But if you are listening only, Isoperla offers an app for birdsong ("Dave Farrow's Bird Song", \u163\'00\'A32.49 from iTunes) that includes an auto-recognition features, though it only offers "probabilities" that you've got the right song, and you'll need some peace and quiet to make the initial recording.\par \par \uc2 Flora\par \par \uc2 Trying to identify flowers is one of life's most bizarrely frustrating tasks. I like the French wild-flower app Fleurs en Poche, which is now available in English as Wild Flowers for \u163\'00\'A33.99, including all our common natives.\par \par \uc2 Or start with something bigger and more permanent: trees. Using a guide such as the Forestry Commission's free app, you can identify the street trees around you without needing to venture anywhere near the countryside. (Imagine my joy when I worked out that the pretty sapling outside my house was the charming "Bastard Service".) If you get really keen, try local botanic gardens: Cambridge's Botanic Garden (botanic.cam.ac.uk), for one, offers a day of Summer Tree Identification for \u163\'00\'A350 on 13 June.\par \par \uc2 If we all aim to add 10 new species to our knowledge list in the next month, the result is a net gain of joy. Two friends of mine are reading Robert Macfarlane's The Old Ways at the moment, imagining wandering along various ancient trackways with the Cambridge don while he mumbles on about his favourite poet, Edward Thomas. And both mates came independently to a similar if trivial conclusion, which is that Macfarlane can identify a truly impressive quantity of birds. And flowers. And geological formations. He can tell you that the owner of an egg was a skylark by the shell's scumbled green; he can tell a Himalayan oak from a Holm. Both readers were left awestruck - and fantasising about one day getting to walk barefoot across a field with handsome Bob.\par \par \uc2 But aside from the self-evident pleasures of Macfarlane himself, there is the pleasure he describes so well: seeing more accurately. Interacting with the world in a more mindful way; being more present. Slowing you down, calming your heart rate. Even if you are using your phone to identify flowers, you're creating a ring-fenced before and after moment.\par \par \uc2 And it extends beyond identification, and right into knowledge itself. A deeper, greener knowledge of your own world. Where you might never misidentify a toad again. *\par \par \uc2 Document INDOS00020140504ea5400015\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Features | Learning at her father's knee, Eleanor Marx was to change the world, says her biographer Rachel Holmes\par \par \uc2 When I set out to write the life of Eleanor Marx in 2006 some friends worried that yet again I'd been seduced by an unfashionable and overly abstruse biographical subject. Either that, or they just said: "Who?" A Marx? The mother of socialist feminism? It didn't sound catchy in our new century.\par \par \uc2 Yet Eleanor Marx is one of British history's great heroes. Born in 1855 in a Soho garret to hard-up German \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  exiles, her arrival was initially a disappointment to her father. He wanted a boy. By her first birthday Eleanor had become his favourite. She was nicknamed Tussy, to rhyme, her parents said, with "pussy" not "fussy". Cats she adored; fussy she wasn't. She loved Shakespeare, Ibsen, both the Shelleys, good poetry, bad puns and champagne. She would be delighted to know that we can claim her as the first self-avowed champagne socialist.\par \par \uc2 Yet during the journey of writing the life of Eleanor Marx I discovered that I was writing about an increasingly topical subject. Friends sent me articles about the resurgence in the reading of the primary work of Marx and Engels amongst the under-50s, particularly in countries where there are currently new movements for social democracy.\par \par \uc2 Then, Harvard University Press published the French economist Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century on the subject of economic inequality. Since its release last month, Piketty's Capital has sold nearly 80,000 copies. This would much amuse Eleanor Marx, who knew how disappointed her father was when the first volume of his Capital was published in 1867 to resounding silence and negligible sales. She spent a large part of her life editing and translating this and subsequent volumes of the work whose distribution outran that of the Bible and Shakespeare in the 20th century.\par \par \uc2 What started for Karl Marx as a 30- to 50-page essay, developed into a life's work that his youngest daughter inherited. She sat on her father's knee, played around him and learned to write and draw by his side at the kitchen table, where he worked in the early years of the project. Tussy and Capital grew up together. Marx said: "Tussy is me." Her life and character form an epic story of adventure, morality, dilemma, contradiction and tragedy. Her thoughts and actions embody Britain's history of struggle to achieve social democracy and equality.\par \par \uc2 Eleanor went out into the world to put into practice and to test what she'd learned from Marx and Engels. Her quest to go ahead; to live it, soon took her into new worlds: the cultural realms of radical modern theatre, the contemporary novel and the artistic circles of early bohemian Bloomsbury. She was a pioneer of Ibsenism in Britain. She translated Flaubert's Madame Bovary into English for the first time. She took to the stage herself - with sometimes hilariously misdirected results. She was also her father's first biographer.\par \par \uc2 Eleanor was born into a Britain that was not yet an electoral democracy. Working-class men, all women and the poor were prohibited from voting. But Eleanor's life is one of the most significant and interesting events in the story of British socialism. Not since Mary Wollstonecraft had any individual made such a profound, revolutionary contribution to political thought - and action.\par \par \uc2 As the late, great Eric Hobsbawm observed, in the 1860s and 1870s native socialists in Britain might have comfortably fitted into one smallish hall. She took this small movement from its visionary stage on to the streets and the political stage. She lived it and she tested it. She was one of the first and most prominent leaders of the new trade unionism, bringing feminism into the heart of the movement. She had an extraordinary gift for friendship. Unconventional, she nevertheless attracted others easily. People felt good around her. Her lifelong, loving relationship with Friedrich Engels and long-term companionships with George Bernard Shaw and Henry Havelock Ellis figure as just an exemplary few of her abundant friendships with men. The close and loving relationship between Eleanor and Olive Schreiner is one of the great female friendships of literary and political history. Eleanor often said: "I inherited my father's nose \u8230\'20\'26 and not his genius." Her friends corrected the error of this self-assessment. Eleanor did inherit her father's genius. The loss entailed on her was not her nose, but her sex.\par \par \uc2 She was born into a Victorian Britain where she had no right to an education, was barred from voting or standing for parliament, excluded from most of the professions and from control of her reproductive and psychological rights. She understood what it meant to be a member of an oppressed class and spent her life fighting for equality. To the people around the world discovering themselves in the new social revolutions, her fight may seem familiar.\par \par \uc2 Crucially, Eleanor Marx was the mother of socialist feminism. She re-christened the so-called "woman question", "the workingwoman debate". She supported and admired the call for women's suffrage. But suffrage reform for middle-class women within existing capitalist society failed to address "the debate on the attitude of social democracy towards working women". Eleanor summarised her position lucidly in an open letter to the English socialist leader Ernest Belfort Bax in November 1895: "I am, of course, as a Socialist, not a representative of 'Woman's Rights'\u8230\'20\'26 The so-called 'Woman's Rights' question (which appears to be the only one you understand) is a bourgeois idea. I proposed to deal with the Sex Question from the point of view of the working class and the class struggle." Women's suffrage lacked a sufficient understanding of the economic base of the division of labour, production and reproduction. Understanding the role of economics in human society was essential to happiness. What, she wondered, constituted happiness? She found the most important element was work.\par \par \uc2 Her philosophy of socialist-feminism was summarised in her treatise The Woman Question: From a Socialist Point of View, co-written with Edward Aveling, her partner. It stands alongside Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Women, Engels' Origin of Private Property, Family and the State and Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own in its significance as a revolutionary text. Eleanor Marx changed the world, in the process revolutionising herself.\par \par \uc2 One of my most cherished lines about Tussy was written by her housekeeper - yes, housekeeper - Gertrude Gentry, who became her friend and confidante. After Eleanor's tragic death in March 1898, grief-stricken Gerty had to tidy and close up Eleanor's house. She wrote to the great Edith Lanchester - Tussy's friend and sometime secretary - about how she dreaded leaving the house forever: "For while we are here we feel she might be coming back."\par \par \uc2 Over a century later, that line expresses precisely my feelings for Tussy from the first moment I started writing her life.\par \par \uc2 EXTRACT\par \par \uc2 ELEANOR MARX: A LIFE BY RACHEL HOLMES\par \par \uc2 Bloomsbury, \u163\'00\'A325\par \par \uc2 "Now 37, Marx is conflicted over the bearing of girls. It's a truism of the age that daughters are all round more economic, social and sexual trouble than sons \u8230\'20\'26 [He] still hopes that education and equal treatment might strengthen women's place and possibilities in the world. But like every Victorian patriarch, he wants a son, and this is not one."\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140504ea540000g\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Event\par \b \uc2 The Germans were terrified of the Daily Mail and Helena Bonham Carter's great-granddad ran the country: 100 amazing things you didn't know about World War I\b0\par\par\uc2 EVENT REPORTER   \par \uc2 5,584 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par 23:01\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

The nation was sworn to secrecy. The Defence of the Realm Act of 1914 forbade British citizens from talking about military or naval matters in public or buying binoculars. It also outlawed talking on the phone in a foreign language or hailing a cab at night, and proscribed the use of invisible ink when writing abroad.\par \par \uc2 2 Russia tried to go sober for the war... In August 1914, Tsar Nicholas outlawed vodka production, closing down 400 distilleries and 28,000 off-licences.\par \par \uc2 3...And George V got Britain on the wagon. On April 6, 1915, the King announced that he would abstain from alcohol for the duration of the war (elsewhere, alcoholic drinks were watered down and pubs closed at 9.30pm). But no wine, beer or spirits were served in Royal residences until November 11, 1918, when an 1815 cognac was opened \u8211\'20\'13 by Royal command.\par \par \uc2 4 The storm also raged in a teacup. The Lyons Corner House chain of teashops, founded by Jewish \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from Prussia in the 19th century, took out a high court injunction in 1914 to prevent rivals the Lipton Tea Company referring to them as German.\par \par \uc2 5 Crumbs! Our boys went to war in a biscuit barrel. The British Expeditionary Force was so short of transport in 1914 that many units went to France in lorries that were usually used for transporting biscuits.\par \par \uc2 6 British troops were clean fighters. In 1915 the Sunlight Soap Company declared the \u8216\'20\'18British Tommy\u8217\'20\'19 to be the \u8216\'20\'18cleanest fighter in the world\u8217\'20\'19. The Wirral-based company was so confident of the soap it sent to the trenches that it offered a \u163\'00\'A31,000 \u8216\'20\'18guarantee of purity\u8217\'20\'19 on every bar. 7 Not all the top ranks were posh... Of the 144,075 officers demobilised in May 1920, 1,016 had been coal miners before they were called up.\par \par \uc2 8...But British officers were definitely dandies. Burberry opened a new branch in Paris and fitting rooms in Flanders to accommodate servicemen wanting new uniforms.\par \par \uc2 9 All the classes did their duty. Despite the public perception, private schools suffered disproportionately heavy losses during the Great War \u8211\'20\'13 20 per cent of public school boys who enlisted to fight in the war died, compared to 11 per cent of all those who served in the war. Eton\u8217\'20\'19s Memorial to the fallen during the Great War lists 1,157 names.\par \par \uc2 10 It gave us Tiger Woods. So many top-class British golfers were killed during the war that the U.S. became dominant for the first time. American Walter Hagen won the British Open in 1922, 1924, 1928 and 1929, with compatriot Bobby Jones doing so in 1926, 1927 and 1930. No Bobby, no Jack Nicklaus; no Nicklaus, no Tiger Woods...\par \par \uc2 11 Eight million horses were killed on the Western Front. Around the same number as human casualties.\par \par \uc2 12 It marked the beginning of the end for buttons. When the American Expeditionary Force set sail for France in 1917, it was the first army ever to go into war with zip fasteners \u8211\'20\'13 thanks to Swedish\u8211\'20\'13 American inventor Gideon Sundback. British uniforms \u8211\'20\'13 which were popular with children back home who often wore faithful replicas \u8211\'20\'13 had more traditional fasteners.\par \par \uc2 13 Laid end to end, the WWI trenches would stretch around the Earth. There were 25,000 miles of trenches between the English Channel and Switzerland; many had nicknames like Bond Street or Death Valley.\par \par \uc2 14 Mickey Mouse turned up too late to fight. \uc2 Walt Disney\uc2 , then aged 17, trained to be an ambulance driver in 1918 alongside Ray Kroc, the man who turned \uc2 McDonald\u8217\'20\'19s\uc2  into an international chain. Luckily for lovers of Mickey Mouse and Big Macs, they arrived in France after the Armistice.\par \par \uc2 15 Smoking and drinking became seriously hazardous pastimes. \u8216\'20\'18Put that bloody cigarette out\u8217\'20\'19 \u8211\'20\'13 the last words of humourist Saki before he was shot by a sniper on the Somme in 1916. The year before, Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George said that Britain was \u8216\'20\'18fighting Germans, Austrians and drink, and as far as I can see the greatest of these foes is drink\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 16 Mustard gas wasn\u8217\'20\'19t all bad. It killed thousands on the battlefield but was later used as the basis for chemotherapy treatment, as its ability to stop blood production had a similar effect on cancer growths.\par \par \uc2 17 It gave birth to Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf. JRR Tolkien, author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, served as a second lieutenant in the Lancashires on the Somme during the desperate summer of 1916. After all but one of his comrades had been killed, he was invalided out with trench fever and started writing about dead marshes and dark lords. Tolkien\u8217\'20\'19s service revolver is exhibited at the \uc2 Imperial War Museum\uc2  North.\par \par \uc2 18 It gave women the sanitary towel. French nurses on the Western Front discovered that new cellulose bandages made effective sanitary towels. U.S. nurses took the discovery home and in 1921 Kotex launched the cellulose sanitary towel.\par \par \uc2 19 We joined the Japanese to battle for a beer. Japan and Britain were allies in the war and fought alongside each other in China, capturing the German colony of Tsingtao \u8211\'20\'13 where the locals had established the famous brewery \u8211\'20\'13 on November 6, 1914.\par \par \uc2 20 They shot spies at the Tower of London. The first execution of a German spy by firing squad took place on November 6, 1914, when Hans Carl Lody met his end at the Tower of London. His guard noted that Lody \u8216\'20\'18walked as easily and unconcerned as if he were going to a tea party, instead of to his death.\u8217\'20\'19 A further ten spies would be shot at the Tower by the end of the war.\par \par \uc2 21 Many Americans were pro-German. When the U.S. went to war in 1917, Germans were the biggest ethnic community in Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and the frankfurter had been the national snack for over 20 years.\par \par \uc2 22 It gave us pilotless drones 90 years before Afghanistan. In 1917 aviation designers Elmer Sperry and Peter Hewitt designed a pilotless plane for the \uc2 U.S. Navy\uc2 . The machine completed its first flight on Long Island on March, 1918. However, as the machine could go only in one direction and was not capable of coming back, the project was abandoned in 1925.\par \par \uc2 23 It started (and ended) in Africa. The first shot fired by a British soldier came from Alhaji Grunshi, a Ghanaian in the Gold Coast Regiment, on August 7, 1914, during the invasion of Togoland. The war also ended in Africa; the last German troops in the field, under the command of General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, surrendered in present day Tanzania on November 25, 1918, 14 days after the armistice.\par \par \uc2 24 It was big business for the red-light districts. During 1915, brothels on just one street in Le Havre were visited by British and French soldiers 171,000 times. By 1917 there were 137 official brothels along the Western Front, segregated by coloured lamps \u8211\'20\'13 blue for officers and red for men.\par \par \uc2 25 Now you see it, now you don\u8217\'20\'19t. On September 11, 1914 the lake in London\u8217\'20\'19s St James\u8217\'20\'19s Park was drained so that it could not be used as a marker for German bombing.\par \par \uc2 26 There were German bombs over the white cliffs of Dover. The first German bomb to land in Britain was dropped on Christmas Eve 1914 in Dover. It exploded in the garden of a Mr Thomas A Terson and knocked gardener James Banks out of a tree he was pruning.\par \par \uc2 27 Writhing in agony? Have a stiff drink, soldier. Morphine was used sparingly and only in extreme cases in hospital, so men had to suffer through the painful cleaning and irrigation of wounds. However, brandy, champagne and port were dispensed regularly to the sick and wounded.\par \par \uc2 28 Women got the vote. On February 6, 1918, the Representation of the People Act, giving the vote to women (aged over 30) for the first time, received Royal Assent.\par \par \uc2 29 While our boys were being shot at abroad, back home the bobbies went on strike. On August 31, 1918, the Metropolitan Police in London went on strike for better pay, pensions and conditions.\par \par \uc2 30 They burned the Buddhist casualties. Siam (now Thailand) declared war on Germany and Austria- Hungary on July 22, 1917, and sent a small force to serve on the Western Front in the last months of the war. The bodies of 19 officers who died in combat there were burned according to Buddhist rites.\par \par \uc2 31 The first tanks were called \u8216\'20\'18landships\u8217\'20\'19. They were renamed in an attempt to disguise them as water-storage tanks.\par \par \uc2 32 Big Bertha could fire a shell over nine miles. The 48-ton howitzer, used by the Germans, was named after the wife of its manufacturer, Gustav Krupp, and could fire a 2,050lb shell a distance of 9.3 miles. However, it took a crew of 200 men six hours or more to assemble. Germany had 13 of these \u8216\'20\'18wonder weapons\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 33 The British made a pool of peace \u8211\'20\'13 with a massive bomb. The 40ftdeep Pool of Peace is a lake near Messines, Belgium, created in 1917 when the British detonated a mine containing 45 tons of explosive.\par \par \uc2 34 The war was a triumph for the Post Office. By 1918 the London \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  at Regent\u8217\'20\'19s Park, connecting the UK with the Western Front, had handled 114 million parcels and two billion letters. At one point, five million letters a week were coming back from servicemen.\par \par \uc2 35 The snow was deadly in the Dolomites. Avalanches killed 10,000 Italian and Austrian troops fighting in the Dolomite mountain range in northern Italy on \u8216\'20\'18White Friday\u8217\'20\'19 (December 13, 1916).\par \par \uc2 36 Ten per cent of New Zealand\u8217\'20\'19s population fought. Of the 124,000 Kiwis who went to war, 17,000\par \par \uc2 37 Corned beef saved the day. The German spring offensive of 1918 only slowed when hungry troops overran British food dumps and, according to one enemy officer, \u8216\'20\'18totally gorged themselves on food and liquor\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 38 The Government decided to flash the cash. The first pound notes went into circulation in August 1914, and were nicknamed \u8216\'20\'18Bradburys\u8217\'20\'19 after Sir John Bradbury, Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.\par \par \uc2 39 The ref blew the final whistle in 1915. English football struggled on until April 24, 1915 when the last FA Cup final of the war was played at Old Trafford. Sheffield United beat Chelsea 3-0. In Scotland, Celtic won the 1914-15 league after favourites Heart of Midlothian encouraged 16 members of their squad to enlist. Seven died in the war.\par \par \uc2 40 London suffered an almighty blast. A large part of the East End was flattened on January 19, 1917, when a huge explosion tore through the Venesta munitions factory at Silvertown in West Ham, killing 73 and injuring 400 more. Over 60,000 properties were damaged and the explosion was heard as far away as Wiltshire.\par \par \uc2 41 David Cameron owes his second home to the war. The PM\u8217\'20\'19s countryhouse weekends are thanks to Sir Arthur Lee, who gave his Chequers mansion and estate to the nation for use as the official country residence of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s prime ministers in perpetuity on October 5, 1917.\par \par \uc2 42 Rain stopped play at Wimbledon (raining bullets, that is). The Championships were one of the early casualties of the conflict. On January 1, 1915, it was announced that play would be suspended for the duration of the war.\par \par \uc2 43 It gave us shiny cutlery. We have the Kaiser and Yorkshire parsimony to thank for the fact that our cutlery is shiny. In the lead up to hostilities, British military planners went in search of a new alloy for gun barrels. Early attempts by Brearley of Sheffield didn\u8217\'20\'19t work, but rather than being dumped were kept on the factory yard, where it was noticed they didn\u8217\'20\'19t rust. Stainless steel was born.\par \par \uc2 44 Eighty per cent of Tommies SURVIVED the trenches.\par \par \uc2 45 \u8216\'20\'18Wait for me, Old Sport\u8217\'20\'19. Future author of The Great Gatsby F Scott Fitzgerald was just about to sail to France in 1918 as an infantry lieutenant when the war ended. One of his training instructors at Camp Sheridan, Alabama, was future president Dwight D Eisenhower.\par \par \uc2 46 British Intelligence officers in 1915 suspected two cats of spying. The moggies had been observed repeatedly crossing the British trenches, and officers suspected the Germans might have been using them to relay messages.\par \par \uc2 47 Agatha Christie plotted mysteries on the battlefield. She dispensed drugs as a nurse, learning about the poisons she would later use in her murder-mysteries.\par \par \uc2 48 The Zeps scored their first goal. Lieutenant William Leefe Robinson of the Royal Flying Corps was awarded an immediate Victoria Cross after he shot down a German airship over Cuffley, Hertfordshire, on September 3, 1916. Today the village\u8217\'20\'19s football team is nicknamed the Zeps in honour of his achievement \u8211\'20\'13 although the airship was actually a Schuette-Lanz \u8211\'20\'13 as The Schuettes didn\u8217\'20\'19t sound quite as snappy.\par \par \uc2 49 Pigeons became a protected species. More than 100,000 pigeons were used by the British Army to carry messages. Homing pigeons were so important to the Army that a law was passed making it an offence to kill or wound them \u8211\'20\'13 punishable by six months in jail or a \u163\'00\'A3100 fine.\par \par \uc2 50. Kate Moss\u8217\'20\'19s coat started life in the trenches. Tailors Thresher & Glenny of the Strand launched the new \u8216\'20\'18wind, wet and mud resisting\u8217\'20\'19 trenchcoat in December 1914. By 1916, over 10,000 had been sold.\par \par \uc2 51 We can thank it for long summer evenings... On May 21, 1916, British Summer Time was introduced to save fuel for the war, following Germany\u8217\'20\'19s example in April 1916.\par \par \uc2 52...And carrot cake. Invented by clever German cooks to get round the British navel blockade and called Kriegsbrot (war bread).\par \par \uc2 53 Fighting reached Wales \u8211\'20\'13 after the war. In March 1919, 15,000 frustrated Canadian troops still waiting to go home four months after the official fighting ended went on the rampage just outside Ryhl, North Wales. Five died, 23 more were wounded.\par \par \uc2 54 The French didn\u8217\'20\'19t have radar, but they did have parrots... At the beginning of the war, the French experimented with the use of parrots on the Eiffel Tower as an early-warning system against enemy aircraft. A parrot could hear the sound of an aircraft engine 20 minutes before a human. Unfortunately, they could not differentiate between friendly and hostile engines, and so the scheme was scrapped.\par \par \uc2 55 Prince Albert showed his mettle. The future King George VI served in the Royal Navy and was on the battleship HMS Collingwood at the Battle of Jutland, May 31, 1916. Plucky or daft, depending on your point of view, he sat on the roof of his gun turret to watch German battleship SMS Derfflinger open fire.\par \par \uc2 56 Why aye, Monsieur. Hollywood\u8217\'20\'19s favourite Frenchman, Maurice Chevalier, was captured by the Germans in August 1914 after shrapnel pierced his chest and entered his lung. In his prison camp he learned English from an officer in the Durham Light Infantry, hence the trace of a Geordie accent in such Englishlanguage hits as Thank Heavens For Little Girls.\par \par \uc2 57 De Gaulle made five dismal bids for freedom. Future French president Charles de Gaulle was taken prisoner during the World War I after fighting at Verdun. All of his escape attempts were unsuccessful.\par \par \uc2 58 Cuffs were killers. British officers\u8217\'20\'19 rank was initially shown on their cuffs. Once German snipers worked this out, they were moved out of sight to their shoulders.\par \par \uc2 59 There were real dogs of war... Our four-legged friends were used extensively on the battlefield as sentries and messengers, and casualty or \u8216\'20\'18Mercy\u8217\'20\'19 dogs were also vital. These dogs were trained to find the wounded and dying on battlefields and were equipped with medical supplies. Soldiers who could help themselves would tend to their own wounds, while other more gravely wounded soldiers would seek the company of a Mercy dog to wait with them while they died.\par \par \uc2 60...And their work continued off the battlefield, too. The war\u8217\'20\'19s high numbers of blinded soldiers led to rapid advances in the training and use of guide dogs. Germany opened the first guide dog training school in 1917.\par \par \uc2 61 Harry Houdini taught the troops how to escape their captors. The great magician took a year off performing to help sell war bonds \u8211\'20\'13 and teach U.S. soldiers how to slip out of German handcuffs.\par \par \uc2 62 The Germans were terrified of the Daily Mail. The paper\u8217\'20\'19s owner, Lord Northcliffe, was such an effective pro-war propagandist that the German navy sent a warship to shell his home in Broadstairs, Kent, in February 1917. They missed Northcliffe but killed his gardener\u8217\'20\'19s wife.\par \par \uc2 63 Artists sketching the countryside were often arrested as spies. Sir Stanley Spencer, Sir John Lavery and Charles Rennie Mackintosh were all detained under the Defence of the Realm Act.\par \par \uc2 64 It made the Royal Family change its name. The House of Windsor took that name in 1917 when the Royal Family changed their name from the morethan- slightly Germanic Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. 65 It was a very, very costly business. The war cost Britain \u163\'00\'A3475 billion (converted to today\u8217\'20\'19s money). We were the richest nation on Earth in 1914, by the end of the war we were bankrupt.\par \par \uc2 66 There was unrest in Afghanistan (shock). The country remained neutral, but after Turkey joined the war on Germany\u8217\'20\'19s side in November 1914, there was unrest among the country\u8217\'20\'19s predominantly Muslim population, calling upon Afghan ruler Habibullah Khan to attack the British in India. He refused and was later assassinated while hunting in 1919.\par \par \uc2 67 It sent Sherlock over the top. Actor Basil Rathbone called the war \u8216\'20\'18unbelievably monstrous, irrational, pitiable, ugly and sordid\u8217\'20\'19, and described himself as \u8216\'20\'18pigeon-livered\u8217\'20\'19. Nonetheless he joined up and won the Military Cross in September 1918 \u8216\'20\'18for conspicuous resource and daring when on patrol\u8217\'20\'19 after reconnoitering enemy trenches while disguised as a tree. Rathbone\u8217\'20\'19s reckless bravery has been attributed to grief following the death of his brother, John, on the front line.\par \par \uc2 68 Britain\u8217\'20\'19s West Indian colonies contributed around 15,000 soldiers. They served on the Western Front, in Egypt, Palestine and Italy. Two thirds came from Jamaica.\par \par \uc2 69 Lingerie design was never the same again. The military practicability of women\u8217\'20\'19s undergarments in conflict came under close scrutiny. The Royal Worcester Corset Company rose to the challenge in August 1915 by introducing a \u8216\'20\'18Kidfitting Corset with the New Military Curve \u8211\'20\'13 which gives the Erect Poise without any discomfort.\u8217\'20\'19 And the nation fought on.\par \par \uc2 70 Rats in the trenches would eat a wounded man if he couldn\u8217\'20\'19t defend , himself. They crawled over and often bit sleeping troops. In his book Goodbye to All That, Robert Graves described a new officer finding two rats on his blanket tussling for the possession of a severed hand.\par \par \uc2 71 Not even India was safe from attack. Madras in the south-east of the country was bombarded by a German light cruiser in 1914.\par \par \uc2 72 The first dog to become a Hollywood star, Rin Tin Tin, was found in a trench in France shortly before the end of the war. The German Shepherd pup was adopted by an American serviceman and returned to the United States, where he starred in more than 20 films during the Twenties.\par \par \uc2 73 Churchill quit the Government to fight. After being blamed for the disaster at Gallipoli while First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill resigned his government post on November 11, 1915, rejoined the Army and ended up on the Western Front.\par \par \uc2 74 It was responsible for veggie sausage.

Adenauer would go on to become chancellor of West Germany.\par \par \uc2 75 The truth was often a pack of lies. On November 7, 1916, Woodrow Wilson was re-elected President of the United States on the campaign slogan \u8216\'20\'18He kept us out of War.\u8217\'20\'19 Five months later, the USA declared war on Germany.\par \par \uc2 76 The show must not go on.

He\u8217\'20\'19d changed his tune by the end of the war.

Britain\u8217\'20\'19s hostilities officially ceased on August 31, 1921, when an Order in Council was issued declaring an end to the state of war that had been proclaimed in 1914. America remained officially at war with Germany until July 2, 1921, when President Warren Harding interrupted his game of golf on a New Jersey course to sign the necessary document.\par \par \uc2 83 The war gave us Beyonc\u233\'00\'E9 (sort of)... Afro-American marching bands arrived in France with the \uc2 US Army\uc2  in 1917. White French crowds went wild.

On entering the war, U.S. authorities closed New Orleans\u8217\'20\'19s Storyville red-light district. The resulting exodus of musicians north meant jazz met country & western and the blues to make rock \u8217\'20\'19n\u8217\'20\'19 roll and, ultimately, heavy metal.\par \par \uc2 85 The start of peace ended in a riot. On July 19, 1919 Peace Day was celebrated throughout the United Kingdom. It didn\u8217\'20\'19t prove immediately popular. In Luton, ex-servicemen, angered by the amount of money spent on civic ceremonies and functions, rioted.\par \par \uc2 86 It paved the way for the MP3 player. The Decca Dulcephone Portable Gramophone \u8211\'20\'13 which offered \u8216\'20\'18Theatre, music hall and concert room in one\u8217\'20\'19 and was \u8216\'20\'18made to stand the hard knocks of Active Service use\u8217\'20\'19 \u8211\'20\'13 made it possible for troops to take a reliable music player to the front line. Decca actually used one officer\u8217\'20\'19s anguished complaint after a battle as an advertising slogan: \u8216\'20\'18The Huns took my gramophone!\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 87 The term \u8216\'20\'18dogfight\u8217\'20\'19 originated during WWI. The pilot had to briefly turn off the plane\u8217\'20\'19s engine so it would not stall when he turned quickly. When a pilot restarted his engine midair, it sounded like dogs barking.\par \par \uc2 88 Home fires bombed. In the night of March 7, 1918, a 2,204lb bomb dropped by a German \u8216\'20\'18Giant\u8217\'20\'19 bomber demolished 61-67, Warrington Crescent, Maida Vale. It killed American-born Lena Guilbert Ford, the lyricist of Ivor Novello\u8217\'20\'19s hugely popular hit Keep The Home Fires Burning.\par \par \uc2 89 It kick-started the sugar-free diet.

Britain\u8217\'20\'19s future nemesis was present at the battles of Ypres and Passchendaele and was wounded in the left thigh at the Somme in 1916 when a shell exploded in his dugout. In 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard-gas attack.\par \par \uc2 91 A baboon named Jackie served in the South African army on the Western Front. Initially a mascot, Jackie was later given messenger and watch duties \u8211\'20\'13 as well as his own uniform, paybook and rations.

Allied weapons became so hot during firing that the water in their cooling systems reached near boiling point. There were reports of some soldiers firing short bursts of machine-gun fire so they could heat water for their tea or soup.\par \par \uc2 93 The Germans couldn\u8217\'20\'19t decipher messages from the Choctaw Code Talkers. The Germans were skilled at intercepting and solving Allied codes, but when a U.S. commander deployed Choctaw Indian tribe members, they used an extremely complex language that the Germans could not translate. The eight Choctaw men became known as the Choctaw Code Talkers.\par \par \uc2 94 There was blood on the tracks. A troop train taking soldiers heading for Gallipoli collided with a passenger service near Gretna Green, Scotland, on May 22, 1915; 230 died in the crash, still Britain\u8217\'20\'19s worst rail disaster.\par \par \uc2 95 Cocaine was given to soldiers before they went over the top. And in London in 1916, \uc2 Harrods\uc2  sold a kit described as \u8216\'20\'18A Welcome Present for Friends at the Front\u8217\'20\'19 containing cocaine, morphine, syringes and needles.\par \par \uc2 96 The maps helped win the war. In January 1915, Ordnance Survey began a new survey of France to replace existing French maps, which were found to be inaccurate and too small in scale. Over the course of the war it printed at least 25 million battlefield maps for use by British troops. The Southampton company\u8217\'20\'19s printing presses ran round the clock, supplying up to 20,000 maps a day.\par \par \uc2 97 It put tea in bags. Though there is some dispute over the exact moment the tea bag was born, it is undoubtedly true that World War I made the innovation popular \u8211\'20\'13 in particular the production by German company Teekanne of the \u8216\'20\'18tea bomb\u8217\'20\'19 in cotton bags. Hard to credit, perhaps, but it was the Germans who first mastered the individual cuppa.\par \par \uc2 98 Peace brought that loving feeling. The prospect of returning home became even more appealing for troops in March, 1918, when Dr Marie Stopes published her pioneering sex manual for couples, Married Love.\par \par \uc2 99 For some, war really was a death sentence. Over 3,000 men were sentenced to death in British Army courts during the war, but only 306 of these executions were carried out. Offences included desertion (by far the commonest crime), cowardice, murder, espionage, mutiny and striking a superior officer.\par \par \uc2 100 Aspirin was off limits. The popular painkiller was a German invention, leading Boots to promote British medicines that were \u8216\'20\'18equal or superior to the German\u8230\'20\'26 to supersede entirely those enemy products\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 World War I had the highest body count of any war in British history, with more than ten million fatalities\par \par \uc2 By DAN SNOW\par \par \uc2 Did you know that the first British rifle shots in World War I didn\u8217\'20\'19t echo across Flanders fields or northern France but West Africa?\par \par \uc2 Or that fighting spread to China, the Pacific, the Middle East and even the Italian Alps?\par \par \uc2 It is quite likely you didn\u8217\'20\'19t, and why should you?\par \par \uc2 In our public imagination and national memory, World War I is about the Western Front.\par \par \uc2 The line of opposing trench systems divided by a shell-torn no-man\u8217\'20\'19s-land that stretched from the Swiss border to the North Sea coast holds a central place in our minds, along with the many battles that were fought over that 1,000-mile-long strip of territory between 1914 and 1918.\par \par \uc2 Those battles are regarded as an appalling and brutal sacrifice, the supreme follies of a war we entered naively thinking it would be all over by Christmas, with no idea of the slaughter that lay ahead.\par \par \uc2 World War I had the highest body count of any war in British history, with more than ten million fatalities.\par \par \uc2 Quite rightly, then, it\u8217\'20\'19s remembered as a tragedy and even as a failure. But in terms of the proportion of people affected, the toll was actually less than the 17th-century civil wars, when more people in Britain were killed and wounded as a percentage of the population.\par \par \uc2 And it is a mistake to presume that everyone thought the war would be all over by Christmas.\par \par \uc2 A lot of people in the Army knew this was going to be a new kind of conflict that would require massive industrial output as well as military skill.\par \par \uc2 Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener predicted it would be a long campaign and that there would be terrible losses.\par \par \uc2 By building World War I into something that is uniquely terrible, to put it on its own pedestal of awfulness, we run the risk of both missing the real story and also underestimating the effect of war in the present day.\par \par \uc2 People who have fought in any conflict know well that they were awful, too.\par \par \uc2 Life for Britain\u8217\'20\'19s soldiers, sailors and airmen in World War I could be absolutely appalling, but so was being trapped on HMS Sheffield in the Falklands War.\par \par \uc2 But what about tactics and strategy? We think of the war\u8217\'20\'19s great battles, terrible events like the first day of the Somme, July 1, 1916, when there were almost 60,000 British casualties alone, as a series of appalling misjudgments by incompetent Allied generals.\par \par \uc2 But World War I was actually a time of military innovation. The British Armed Forces have probably never undergone such change in their history, and by the end of the war were arguably the best they have ever been.\par \par \uc2 And the Western Front was much more than two opposing lines. The trenches were big cities, with cinemas, post offices, bakeries, warehouses and brothels.\par \par \uc2 The effects of World War I were not just felt on the battlefield; the social effects at home were immense. For the first time, women went into the factories, taking the jobs the men left behind when they joined up.\par \par \uc2 The young men who went to war left behind an old world and entered a new one. If they survived for long enough they would see the birth of the war in the air, and battlefield communications revolutionised by radio.\par \par \uc2 They would go to war alongside horses, but by 1917 would be fighting with tanks. It was a conflict where the centuries-old warrior ethos of men going into battle with bagpipes was still used, but so was poison gas.\par \par \uc2 It was an incredible time of transition; a war that 100 years later continues to surprise me.\par \par \uc2 Timeline WW1 for iPad is available to download for FREE from the iTunes store.

Kaiser Wilhelm\u8217\'20\'19s bellicose Weltpolitik (world policy) led to diplomatic encirclement, having thoroughly frightened Britain, France and Russia.\par \par \uc2 Many historians agree Germany used the situation in the Balkans, even at the risk of war.\par \par \uc2 Others argue that they desired and planned for war.\par \par \uc2 Russia, defeated by Japan in 1905, was rapidly rebuilding its military strength, and some of the German elite favoured a war to prevent it from re-emerging as a rival.\par \par \uc2 When article 231 of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles blamed Germany and its allies for the outbreak of the war, it encapsulated an essential truth.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Gary Sheffield, 2014.

No control. The EU has opened our borders to 4,000 people every week.'\par \par \uc2 The poster adds: 'Take back control of our country.'\par \par \uc2 During the launch he was forced to admit Ukip had 'some idiots' after a row erupted over \uc2 Stockport council\uc2  election candidate Harry Perry.\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 Twitter\uc2  Mr Perry called for Pakistan to be 'nuked', dubbed David Cameron a 'gay-loving nutcase', Muslims 'devil's kids' and homosexuality an 'abomination before god'.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said: 'I've never heard of the bloke until last night. I've no idea who he is.\par \par \uc2 'I think he comes from the north west of England. Clearly his attitude and views are entirely inconsistent with being a member of Ukip. Simple.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Perry was suspended from the party today.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Farage claimed the media's reporting of what goes wrong in his party is 'completely disproportionate'.\par \par \uc2 He added: 'I could show you 14 elected councillors from the Lib Dem, Labour and Conservative parties who haven't just said nasty things they've been convicted this year of nasty things. And yet it never makes a national headline.'\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140503ea53005ei\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 No, it's not racist to think Ukip has a point about \uc2 immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By Tim Stanley   \par \uc2 744 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par 20:53\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Matthew Parris has written {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article4079835.ece"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 a silly column about Ukip. A very silly column}}}\uc2 . It fits with the growing narrative that Ukip isn\u8217\'20\'19t just a bunch of xenophobic golf players with too much time on their hands but actually the first stage of the Fourth Reich. Oh my, it is silly.\par \par \uc2 At an almost empty Derby railway station, I passed a little posse of youths with purple badges and pound-sign stickers and \u8230\'20\'26 felt just momentarily menaced \u8230\'20\'26 I was starting to look at the Ukip phenomenon with new eyes.\par \par \uc2 Were those eyes entirely open, Matthew? For an angry gang of Ukip canvassers might be the least terrifying sight in the world: a gaggle of spotty libertarians, fox hunting enthusiasts and a confused old lady who thinks they\u8217\'20\'19re all collecting for Cancer Relief.\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s more. One of Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s leaflets landed on Matthew\u8217\'20\'19s door mat and, through those misty eyes of his, it read like a copy of the Vlkischer Beobachter. He saw the warnings about mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s cry that \u8220\'20\'1CEnough is enough\u8221\'20\'1D and Mr Parris \u8220\'20\'1Cfelt just a bit frightened. This thing has a bad smell. I picked up that leaflet, read lies and saw the menace.\u8221\'20\'1D Did Matthew feel the same way in 2005 when Michael Howard asked the public if they were thinking what he was thinking about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ? Never mind, because what really concerns Matthew is what the \u8220\'20\'1Cyoung woman of East European origin\u8221\'20\'1D who cleans the entrance of his apartment block thinks about it all. He imagines that if she read Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s leaflet she might be \u8220\'20\'1Cthreatened\u8221\'20\'1D by its language. And he adds that it\u8217\'20\'19s a tragedy that no one in the Tory party is prepared to stand up for \u8220\'20\'1Cthe cleaning woman on our East London staircase\u8221\'20\'1D. Earth to Matthew: Tory MPs have rarely stood up for East European cleaning women and probably never will. They employ them, they underpay them and they occasionally hit on them \u8211\'20\'13 but they don\u8217\'20\'19t typically include them in the election address.\par \par \uc2 Yes, it\u8217\'20\'19s all getting rather silly, isn\u8217\'20\'19t it? The Right-wing Ukip has, unsurprisingly, attracted fruitcakes and racists who regard it as a vehicle for their appalling views. This ought to have played into the hands of the mainstream parties and, in Matthew\u8217\'20\'19s ideal world, they'd be putting together a united front against the Hitlerian menace coming out of West Kent. But that\u8217\'20\'19s not actually happened. On the latest edition of Question Time, the panel was asked if Ukip was a racist party \u8211\'20\'13 and Labour, Tory and Lib Dem all said \u8220\'20\'1Cno\u8221\'20\'1D. Why? Because they know that to call Ukip racist is to damn its sympathisers by association. And a growing number of those sympathisers are regular swing voters who the mainstream parties want to woo, too. You see, beyond Matthew Parris\u8217\'20\'19s East London staircase is a Britain populated by people with entirely legitimate concerns about uncontrolled mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . All the parties are doing their best to court them. Ukip is currently winning because the establishment has lost the trust of millions on the issue. In other words, few politicians will explicitly damn the Ukip revolution because they know that it speaks for a sizeable part of the population. The kind of people who can\u8217\'20\'19t afford to employ East European cleaners. Or even people who are cleaners and who feel they can\u8217\'20\'19t compete with the EU-born competition. Real people, not columnists like Matthew and me.\par \par \uc2 Ukip is doing something very interesting. It is delineating the boundaries between the metropolitan elite and the provincial disaffected \u8211\'20\'13 and inviting the two groups to define themselves by opposition to one another. Implicit in Matthew Parris\u8217\'20\'19s remarks is a dislike of those who wail about the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . The pull quote on his article reads, \u8220\'20\'1CMany inadequate people blame their problems on foreigners.\u8221\'20\'1D That\u8217\'20\'19s a nice sentiment, isn\u8217\'20\'19t it? Those inadequates presumably include out of work plumbers, those stuck on housing waiting lists, parents searching for school places. Of course, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has cultural and economic benefits that a newspaper columnist with a First in PPE might be able to quote to satisfy the more learned readers. But don\u8217\'20\'19t dismiss the feelings of less elite subscribers to The Times, Matthew. Or else they might start voting Ukip.

I have no regrets.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI consider this organisation (Tell Mama) was publicly funded on false premises. The tweets were rude and sarcastic, but I do think this was a victory for free speech.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The day long trial heard evidence from Dutch scholar Hans Jansen, a taqiyya expert.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Mughal, aged 42, who gave evidence during the trial by video link, said: \u8220\'20\'1CA green light has been given for this man to use this terminology in the future.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CA Muslim scumbag was what I was called, and the court has effectively allowed that. What does that say to Muslims in Birmingham?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Burton stressed: \u8220\'20\'1CI am not racist, absolutely not. Islam is not a race. I am not Islamophobic. Phobia is an irrational fear of something.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The trial judge decided Mr Burton had a right to free expression and felt the tweets did not constitute harassment.\par \par \uc2 He did, however, urge Mr Burton to consider moderating his language in future.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s a ruling that has angered Mr Mughal. He added: \u8220\'20\'1CThis man is an ideologue in relation to his thinking about Muslims. This was a very important case because it was based on anti-Muslim rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNo one should be targeted like this \u8211\'20\'13 that is all I\u8217\'20\'19m saying.

He was released on bail.\par \par \uc2 The government did not renew its grant to Tell Mama after the group failed to identify that much of a rise in Islamophobic incidents reported to it following the death of Lee Rigby referred to activity that took place only online.\par \par \uc2 Mr Mughal was targeted by hardline Muslims earlier this month after he invited gay rights champion Peter Tatchell to be a patron of Tell Mama.\par \par \uc2 Document EVEMONL020140503ea53001md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 You want tougher \uc2 immigration\uc2  controls? Prepare to queue for them\b0\par\par\uc2 By Benedict Brogan   \par \uc2 1,062 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par 18:11\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Earlier this week travellers coming through London's major airports had a horror of a time because of a problem with the computer that reads passport details. Border Force staff manning the desks had to enter the information of arriving passengers manually, which meant queues lasting hours, which in turn meant anger, frustration, mayhem on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and pictures flooding the internet of passengers herded like cattle down corridors at Heathrow and elsewhere. News reports were rich with colourful commentary from those trapped by the problem.\par \par \uc2 I was reminded of the story on Thursday as I stood on the ramps overlooking the Channel Tunnel terminal outside Folkestone, watching the shuttles set off one after another carrying lorries and cars towards France. I was there to report on the Tunnel's 20th anniversary, and you can read my report and see the accompanying video {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/10804227/Twenty-years-of-Chunnel-vision.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 here}}}\uc2 . A Thursday in May is a low-key day for the Chunnel, but there was plenty of traffic, and lorries queued to get in to their special pen. Any Telegraph reader who has used the Tunnel for a holiday break will know what it's like on the first days when the schools break up, or on bank holiday weekends. And those returning from their gites on the other side of the Channel will know about the hours of waiting to enter the terminal on the French side on a balmy late August evening as the Brits head home. Hang about the newsagent at either end and you will see a lot of Daily Telegraphs (and Daily Mails and Suns and even Daily Expresses) being bought by those waiting for their turn to drive onto the shuttle. It's only a hunch, but I suspect quite a few of those travellers are of a conservative bent, possibly Tories or Ukippers. And \u8211\'20\'13 again, just a hunch \u8211\'20\'13 I suspect many of them, if not a majority, have quite strong views about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , whether it's the illegals hiding in the scrubland in and around Calais looking for a lorry to sneak onto, or the European citizens who have, entirely legally, come to Britain to find work and even now hold the countless service jobs that keep the country ticking over.\par \par \uc2 What is certainly true is that anyone who has spent time trapped in the queues at either end of the Tunnel on a busy travel day will have witnessed the outbursts of anger from British travellers (85pc of the traffic is from the UK) who don't like having to wait one bit, and, after a few hours of stewing with grumpy kids in the family car are more than happy to give a spot of the hairdryer to \uc2 Eurotunnel\uc2  and Border Force staff. I wonder if they know it's about to get a whole lot worse?\par \par \uc2 The new \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Bill being proposed by Theresa May includes a provision to require exit checks. This means that not only will Border Force staff have to check all passports when anyone enters the UK, but they will now have to check them whenever someone leaves. And by checking I mean taking hold of it, comparing the picture to your face, studying the document AND putting it through the scanner thingy that records the information it contains. Now, you might say that's a brilliant idea. After all, haven't we banged on for ages about Labour dropping embarkation controls, and the fact that we don't have a way of counting people in and out to give us an idea of how many people are here? Of course. But go back to all those Telegraph readers, all those conservative folk who, understandably but possibly unconsciously, have become accustomed to what the Europeans call the "free movement of peoples". What's more, they have come to appreciate the way modern technology has made things faster and easier. At the Tunnel, for example, cameras and computers now read number plates as a vehicle approaches the terminal, so there is no need to type in anything, and one can just zip through check-in \u8211\'20\'13 only to crash into the queues of the manually-controlled border point. The French, and other European forces, do it differently. They rely on intelligence-led policing and controls. They don't worry about discriminating. They think nothing of yanking the car full of young bearded Asian men from the queue for example, while leave the white family of four with bicycles on the roof free to go through. On our side we fear discrimination, and prefer to be thorough. And slower.\par \par \uc2 Most of this is about politics. David Cameron, under pressure from his right, and the press, and Ukip, has promised to do something about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . So far he is failing, and so is trying even harder. The experts of course say there are other ways of doing things that don't require checking every single passport, if what matters is national security. But of course that's not what matters to Mr Cameron. What matters to him is not being outflanked by Ukip or shouted at by the Telegraph, Mail, Sun and Express. Then there's the Border Force, which has been reformed, changed, had money taken away, and is now demoralised and politically angry. I know for example that \uc2 Eurotunnel\uc2  bosses are frequently incensed because on the days when traffic is highest they are more likely to be told that staff are sick or \u8211\'20\'13 ironic, this \u8211\'20\'13 on holiday themselves. The sick-rate in the Border Force is noticeably higher than among \uc2 Eurotunnel\uc2  employees, which tells you something.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron wants exit checks in place before the election. There's a great debate underway about the means. Will there be funding for more staff? Will the Government allow the use of face recognition technology? Will local managers be allowed flexibility to deal with crowds and use intelligence discrimination on checks? Who knows. But it is one of the fascinating paradoxes of our time: we have demanded tougher \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  controls. We are gradually getting them. And you know what? We are going to have to queue for them. I wonder if the people lining the corridors at Heathrow and the lanes at the Channel Tunnel have an inkling that they have got what they wished for.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140503ea5300335\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Saturday Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 Saturday: Can a declining Scottish press hold national institutions to account?\b0\par\par\uc2 Ian Jack   \par \uc2 1,292 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 33\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Newspapers face a grim future in most parts of the western world, but nowhere does it look grimmer than in Scotland. There their decline has been steep and sudden, and with potentially much more troubling consequences for a country that, whether it leaves the United Kingdom or not, has a government and institutions that grow in their power and autonomy and need the scrutiny of an intelligent press. As the journalist Iain Macwhirter writes in an alarm-bell-ringing essay published this week by the Saltire Society, "Scotland has a national political system, but is in danger of losing a national media."\par \par \uc2 Nothing in Scotland's history suggests that it would abandon its newspapers so readily, or at a time when reading a good one might be more necessary. Scotland used to boast that, per capita, it had the world's highest newspaper consumption - higher certainly than England's - while the Sunday Post featured in the Guinness Book of Records as the newspaper with the largest "readership saturation" of any national, meaning that it was read by three fifths of Scotland's five million people. The Glasgow Herald (now the Herald) can claim to be the oldest continuously published newspaper in the world; it was founded in 1783, two years before the Times's forerunner, the Daily Universal Register, appeared in London.\par \par \uc2 When I worked as a journalist in Glasgow in the 1960s, the variety of newspapers felt immense. There were the London titles that were shipped north by overnight train; there were the London titles that published distinctively Scottish editions in Edinburgh and Glasgow; and then there was the indigenous Scottish press that published mornings and evenings in the four big cities. No genuinely all-Scotland quality paper ever emerged from this patchwork, but the Herald out of Glasgow and the Scotsman from Edinburgh became, together with the Irish Times and for a while the Yorkshire Post, the finest newspapers published in these islands outside London.\par \par \uc2 As recently as 10 years ago, little of this looked in obvious financial danger. The Mail and the Express no longer published their Scottish editions in Scotland, but the future of the indigenous titles looked secure. \uc2 Newsquest\uc2 , the UK division of the US publishing house Gannet, paid pounds 216m for the Herald, the Sunday Herald and the \uc2 Glasgow Evening Times\uc2  in 2004. \uc2 Johnston Press\uc2 , which had made its fortune in local papers, bought the Scotsman from the Barclay twins for pounds 160m in 2006, which was almost double what the \uc2 Barclays\uc2  had paid 11 years earlier. These newspaper groups weren't alone in their blind confidence in newsprint's future: the Guardian, after all, splurged pounds 80m on new printing presses in 2005. But the Scottish papers already sold in relatively low numbers, and the combination of the internet and the financial crisis, with its particular effect on jobs, car and property advertising, has shrunk several of them to the point of questionable viability. According to Macwhirter's essay, the Scotsman has shed 80% of its readers since the \uc2 Johnston Press\uc2  bought it, and the Johnston share price has collapsed from 450p to 24p. Given that the free Metro paper lost a quarter of its Scottish circulation last year alone, it could be said of newspapers in Scotland that you can't even give them away.\par \par \uc2 Outside the loss of jobs, does it matter? Several of the London papers still have Scottish editions - anyone with an interest in the world beyond Britain would need to read one in any case, because no purely Scottish newspaper can afford more than minimal foreign coverage. But Macwhirter argues that their basically southern orientation means that Scotland "is increasingly observing itself in a distorting mirror, in which civil society is bent out of shape by the preoccupations of a media that is not its own". Issues such as Michael Gove's education reforms, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and the rise of Ukip, which have little direct relevance to Scotland, "assume disproportionate prominence in public debate". Why is it that no paper other than (possibly) the Sunday Herald will support Scottish independence when a third of the electorate says they want it? Macwhirter suggests part of the answer lies in the geographical location of the paper's ownership and editorial control in a situation where the Scottish press is "almost entirely foreign-owned".\par \par \uc2 "Foreign" means anywhere outside Scotland, so \uc2 Trinity Mirror\uc2  and the \uc2 Daily Mail and General Trust\uc2  are included in the definition as well as Gannet and Rupert Murdoch's \uc2 News Corp\uc2 , which have their roots in the US. Still, "almost entirely" seems a stretch. The \uc2 Johnston Press\uc2  is Scottish, as is \uc2 DC Thomson\uc2 ; they own three mornings, three evenings and two Sundays between them - every newspaper published in Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen. None of them is in the Yes camp either. In the end, Macwhirter can only imagine that under the domination of London papers the Scottish media have developed "a kind of unionist groupthink; a propensity to accord authority to unionist voices, which has . . . significantly coloured the character of the referendum campaign, [cramping] public understanding of the choices facing Scotland in its most important year in three centuries".\par \par \uc2 Then again, it may be something simpler: newspapers with tumbling circulations are inclined to try to hang on to their old audiences rather than to pursue new ones, which is increasingly the mission of news websites, where experiment and failure come at a far lower cost. Scotland has several good ones, mainly nationalist by inclination and sometimes crowdsourced, but the chances that any will ever earn enough revenue to sustain even one full-time reporter over the long term are remote. Could broadcasting fulfill the role of national scrutineer? In Macwhirter's words, "the decline of the press has left the BBC almost single-handedly with the task of reconstituting the national conversation", but BBC Scotland is in a fix, with an uncertain future in the event of a Yes vote and a difficult present as a lacklustre news broadcaster: a "national humiliation" was how the historian Tom Devine once described its radio output.\par \par \uc2 In the end, Macwhirter decides the state will have to support Scotland's indigenous press if the country is to be intelligently reported and a distinctively Scottish journalism preserved. How could it happen? Possibly like this: a newspaper's circulation - say the Scotsman's - collapses so dramatically that its owner has no choice but to shut it. National consternation follows: that lovely masthead with the thistles is as important to Scotland's sense of itself as the Forth bridge. An independent trust takes over the title funded by a combination of private philanthropy and government money. The trust's constitution guarantees that the government can't influence the editorial content. Uproar follows from the paper's rivals. Eventually, a government fund is set up that doles out small grants to newspapers or websites it deems essential to cultural diversity. After all, doesn't the Scottish government already part-fund the Gaelic channel, BBC Alba? And doesn't Norway spend pounds 30m a year on promoting cultural diversity in its newspapers? And isn't Norway in so many ways exemplary - a model for Scotland?\par \par \uc2 Before I read Macwhirter's essay I wouldn't have believed any of this a possibility. I am less sure now - less sure also that it would be worse than the alternative, which is closure followed by closure and the slow death of proper journalistic inquiry into many aspects of Scottish life, not just governmental, no matter which side wins the referendum or whoever comes to power.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 The Scotsman has lost 80% of its readership since 2006\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140503ea530006l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Weekend Pages\par \b \uc2 Weekend: Coming clean: Graham MacIndoe was a successful photographer, working for this magazine among others. Then he began a destructive journey into heroin addiction - and turned the camera on himself. He and his partner Susan Stellin recall the road to recovery\b0\par\par\uc2 Graham MacIndoe Susan Stellin   \par \uc2 1,943 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 38\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Most documentary projects about addiction expose someone else's self-destructive behaviour, but Graham MacIndoe took a very different approach: he photographed himself during the years he was addicted to drugs. He'd place a cheap digital camera on a table or bookshelf, set the self-timer to take a photo every so often, then turn his attention to the rituals of his habit: filling a crack pipe, cooking heroin, shooting up. Over time, he became more deliberate about lighting and composition, but the point was not to glamorise what had become a solitary existence, the monotonous repetition of an addict's daily life.\par \par \uc2 I am not a casual observer of these images; after Graham and I broke up because of his drug use, I found 342 self-portraits - images he had not meant for me to see. "In some way, this is exactly what I'd been curious to see," I wrote at the time. "All those close-ups of the needle going into a vein, his expression during and after, the rooms and stairwells I never saw. . . Maybe the point is, 'So you wanted to see? Here it all is.' And then we're supposed to feel sick over our voyeurism, because maybe we didn't need to see that after all."\par \par \uc2 Now I think we do need to see it, and try to understand addiction from the inside, as Graham describes what he wanted to show. Not the view of an outsider, but a first-person account of the isolating, all-consuming nature of addiction. No one else is in the pictures; drugs have replaced everyone and everything that used to matter.\par \par \uc2 Beating the odds, Graham has been clean since 2010, and we've been back together for most of that time - a road to recovery that included four months at Rikers Island and five months in \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  detention, after he was ordered to be deported from the US. (Born in Scotland, he moved to New York legally and has a green card, but even a minor conviction can lead to permanent exile these days.)\par \par \uc2 A rare prison rehab programme and a compassionate judge set him free, but Graham did the hard work to rebuild his life. To anyone who knows him, these photographs are a painful reminder of a dark, difficult era, but they also exhibit signs of hope: that Graham wanted to live to show them some day. In this interview, we talk about the complexities of addiction and what we learned about escaping its grip.\par \par \uc2 A conversation between Graham MacIndoe and Susan Stellin\par \par \uc2 Susan Stellin Tell me about the first time you used heroin.\par \par \uc2 Graham MacIndoe The very first time, I smoked it. I was in my apartment in New York with a couple of friends. We'd been doing cocaine and I was coming down really badly, and somebody said, "You should smoke a little bit of this." So we put it in a cigarette and smoked it, and I got really dizzy. It wasn't really pleasant, to be honest, but it did take the edge off the cocaine.\par \par \uc2 SS Did you do it again soon after that?\par \par \uc2 GM Yeah, I did it a few other times to combat the comedown from the cocaine. I liked the high, but the comedown was devastating. It would make you just want to cry and stay in for days on end. Being in that addictive frame of mind, I wanted to see what it was like on its own. I went straight to injecting soon after that, because it seemed like a more efficient method of delivery, like crack is a much more efficient delivery of cocaine. I knew a couple of active intravenous heroin users, and I asked them and they quite willingly enabled me.\par \par \uc2 SS Did you consider yourself an addict at the time?\par \par \uc2 GM Oh, yeah. When I first really started doing drugs, I felt it was enhancing my life - it just made everything sort of great. But I knew I was an addict when I started having to do it in the morning when I woke up. That's when you know.\par \par \uc2 SS Do you remember when that was?\par \par \uc2 GM I remember that feeling of waking up one morning after getting about an hour and a half of sleep and having to be somewhere. And my eyes were red and I was so tired and I didn't want to move. It was worse than any hangover - I was so depressed. And I had some cocaine left from the night before. And I did that line and I was like, boompf - I'm ready to go, I can take on the world now. Later on, I realised that, wow, I'm using first thing in the morning.\par \par \uc2 SS And what about when you started lying and covering up?\par \par \uc2 GM I didn't really have to lie in the beginning, because the people around me were doing it all the time. These were people in similar situations to me - you know, working, creative, for want of a better expression, "high-living", had money. Unfortunately, I was one of the ones who went down the addiction path. Some people went down the party path and got fed up with it. I went down the addiction path and had to see it to its end. So there was a bit of that hiding and sneaking around - there always is with drugs.\par \par \uc2 SS When we first started dating, did you think I wasn't going to catch on?\par \par \uc2 GM In the beginning, I didn't think you would. I was a much edgier person than you, and there was a slight attraction to that. I liked that sort of recklessness in me, and that sort of composed way that you are. You've got routines, and do things in a set order. I thought that's what I needed. And I was hoping some of that would rub off; that if I get in this good relationship with somebody who's solid, I can overturn my addiction, because it'll be stronger than this. In reality it wasn't.\par \par \uc2 SS When you talk about wanting to quit, was it just a moment and then it would go away? Because I think that's what people don't understand: why doesn't this person want to quit; or if they do want to quit, why can't they?\par \par \uc2 GM I really wished I could've quit. And there's nothing in my heart that I feel so bad about - not being able to quit when I first met you. Because I would've saved myself and my family a lot of stress and pain and anger and money and humiliation.\par \par \uc2 I quit a bunch of times, but I always slipped back into it because it's not the quitting - it's the long-term thing. You don't know how to function, because you've been so dysfunctional for so long that you find yourself going back to your comfort zone, and your comfort zone is being around people who are in the same boat as you. You go to somebody's house where other people are using, and it's like you're with your family again. They tell you it's going to be all right, then you take a hit, then you think, fuck it, I feel good. Because it's hard to get your shit together when you don't feel good. And when the reality of where you've been and how much you've done and the lies you've told all dawns on you, it's hard to face.\par \par \uc2 SS Did the pressure of starting to run out of money compound things?\par \par \uc2 GM Yeah, it did. I wasn't working - I didn't know how to work at that point - so I was running out of money, I couldn't pay my bills, I was spending my savings, I was borrowing money from people. And I was going down that cliched path of someone who falls into deep addiction. You start losing everything. You start losing your friends, your savings, the place you live. You lose sight of reality, your morals - everything goes down the drain. You sort of give in to it.\par \par \uc2 SS What are the key factors to helping someone, or were key to helping you?\par \par \uc2 GM Rehabilitation is really important. Jail doesn't work. Jailing somebody for being an addict is not going to help them, because it doesn't teach them anything. You need to teach people different thought processes and different ways of running their life. You might have started taking drugs just to party, but at the end of the day, what they do to your mind is they bring out every insecurity, every piece of pain, every piece of anger you've had in your life and bring them to the top of the pile. Those are the things you dwell on when you're an addict. So you have to address them. You have to address, how can I stop being angry, how can I stop being jealous, how can I get my self-esteem up, how can I feel more comfortable in my skin?\par \par \uc2 SS What can people who know and love an addict do to help?\par \par \uc2 GM People need to be nurtured out of addiction. Turning a blind eye because you think you can do nothing is really destructive. Because you're getting somebody at the lowest ebb of their life who just needs something, and they don't know how to do it. But you have to stand up to them, too, because addicts are really manipulative and lie all the time. You have to get professional help. There should be much more help to stop this never-ending pile of people going in and out of jail for drug possession. And they need to be put in mandatory programmes - because if you give an addict a choice, they're going to choose drugs.\par \par \uc2 SS Do you worry that you'll relapse?\par \par \uc2 GM No, I don't. I mean, there's a chance everybody could relapse, but I don't worry about it. It was such a deep, dark, destructive journey for me, and recovery has been so enlightening that I can't even think what would push me back down that line.\par \par \uc2 When you're on drugs, you never think you're going to be able to get back to where you were or anywhere close to living a normal life. And you can - not real easy, but you can. Things are never going to be the same, but it can be fulfilling and it can be enlightening and life-changing. It has been for me. I mean, my priorities are different now. Not that I was a bad or selfish person, but I think more of other people and I see humanity in a different way. I'm much more passionate about life *\par \par \uc2 A longer version of this article appears on theguardian.com/weekend.

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Harry Perry, a Ukip candidate, is suspended from the party after describing David Cameron as a "gay-loving nutcase" and calling Muslims "devil's kids"\par \par \uc2 A would-be Ukip councillor has been suspended over offensive remarks Nigel Farage said were "entirely inconsistent" with being a member of the party.\par \par \uc2 Harry Perry posted comments on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  describing David Cameron as a "gay-loving nutcase", calling Muslims "devil's kids" and homosexuality "an abomination before god".\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage, the Ukip leader, admitted there were "some idiots" in the party as he condemned Mr Perry's comments\par \par \uc2 A Ukip spokesman confirmed Mr Perry, who was due to stand for the party in the May 22 elections in the Offerton ward in Stockport, had been suspended.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage, who was on the campaign trail in Dover, said: "I've never heard of the bloke until last night. I've no idea who he is.\par \par \uc2 "I think he comes from the north west of England. Clearly his attitude and views are entirely inconsistent with being a member of Ukip. Simple."\par \par \uc2 But the Ukip leader again hit out at the scrutiny his party had come under since its dramatic rise in the opinion polls.\par \par \uc2 He said: "I could show you 14 elected councillors from the Lib Dem, Labour and Conservative parties who haven't just said nasty things they've been convicted this year of nasty things.\par \par \uc2 "And yet it never makes a national headline. I am not saying we haven't had our problems, we have.\par \par \uc2 "Every party has these kinds of problems but there is a completely disproportionate media spotlight on what goes wrong in Ukip compared to the others."\par \par \uc2 When asked what he thought of David Cameron's comments about not needing to discredit Ukip as they do a "good enough job themselves", Mr Farage laughed and said: "It was good, clever politics. I'll give him that. Yeah, we've got some idiots.\par \par \uc2 "What is happening here is the establishment are singling out a handful of unpleasant comments made by Ukip people and yet the other parties do these things and say these things it would appear with impunity.\par \par \uc2 "The other thing Mr Cameron said is that I was a chicken.\par \par \uc2 "Well, I'll tell you what Dave, why don't you come on telly and do a debate with me?"\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage made the comments as he launched Ukip's billboard campaign for the Euro-elections against the backdrop of the cliffs of Dover.\par \par \uc2 The campaign poster features a picture of the famous landmark with an escalator running up the middle and the slogan: "No border. No control. The EU has opened our borders to 4,000 people every week."\par \par \uc2 The poster adds: "Take back control of our country."\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader believes his party's "simple" message about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  will get the public, if not politicians, talking.\par \par \uc2 "I've been trying over the course of the last few weeks to have a national debate on this issue.\par \par \uc2 "They point blank refuse to engage with me. On Monday this billboard will be going up on hundreds of sites right across the United Kingdom, and even if the politicians don't want to discuss this issue, I think this very simple, straightforward message is going to get the public talking about it," he said.\par \par \uc2 He added: "We may well be on the edge of the biggest migratory wave yet to come to these shores and the \uc2 British Government\uc2  is impotent, there is nothing we can do.\par \par \uc2 "The only way to solve this Mr Cameron, and Mr Miliband, is for the British people to have a referendum so that we can discuss this openly and vote on it."\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140503ea53003bl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Sky sales agents who contacted the Guardian went in front of our cameras to reveal selling practices they claim are common at their branch. Here's what they said - in their own words.\par \par \uc2 Targeting vulnerable customers:\par \par \uc2 "Sky agents will target people who don't speak English - recent \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , Polish, eastern European people - we will tell them anything to sell Sky products."\par \par \uc2 "We don't go to expensive areas because there the customer knows the cost of everything. They know the difference between normal broadband or fibre. They would just slam the door in our face and it would be a waste of time.\par \par \uc2 "We don't want to waste time, so we go to the poorest areas where there are lots of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  that believe everything we tell them."\par \par \uc2 "Some roads we visit four times a year . . . more even. The people recognise us and get angry because the agent lied to them last time. It's a bad feeling for them, but we have to keep selling."\par \par \uc2 Mis-selling call packages:\par \par \uc2 "Sky is selling three products - TV, phone and broadband - and in the three products there is mis-selling.\par \par \uc2 "Take the telephone package . . . Sky sells Anytime Calls International with (free) calls to a limited number of countries. Many agents tell the customer their country is free to call - for example, Egypt or Iran - even if it is not included in the package."\par \par \uc2 Exaggerating broadband speeds:\par \par \uc2 "Take broadband. There is lying about the speeds, giving normal broadband for the fibre, promising unlimited broadband, but giving them the Everyday Lite (limited) broadband."\par \par \uc2 Pressure to sell:\par \par \uc2 "If we don't get a sale we will be called by the manager at 10 clock in the office, not to motivate us or train us - it's just to punish us."\par \par \uc2 "Many of the managers have come from a gas and electric background which recently has been closed down due to mis-selling. The managers migrated from that area."\par \par \uc2 "Sales agents not performing, they (the management) are tracking them, as we have been given the company mobile, and the company iPad, as well as the company car. They are tracking us after working hours even on Saturdays as well . . . especially the agents that are under-performing, or not giving good numbers."\par \par \uc2 "When we see a customer's house or their children, I feel pity for them. There are many customers that literally cry with us. I tell my manager he is putting everyone's job at risk and the same thing happened with the gas and electric industry - he is just laughing at me."\par \par \uc2 Promising extra channels:\par \par \uc2 "We promise customers they get a certain kids' channel such as \uc2 Disney\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Kids are excited, the customer is excited, all tempted by the prices. But when the installation is done they never get the kids' channels. When they ring customer services they find they have to pay extra.\par \par \uc2 "It is too late then, as they are already out of their cooling off period. Already trapped in, and the agent has already secured his commission, and the manager secures his bonus."\par \par \uc2 Customers who end up with both Sky and Virgin:\par \par \uc2 "Some customers signed up to two contracts, but cancelled and found that they put negative things on their credit file. One had saved up pounds 42,000 for a house but couldn't get a mortgage as result."\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140503ea530003c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

In a post-industrial age, can that camaraderie be reawakened?\b0\par\par\uc2 Richard Benson   \par \uc2 2,276 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.

All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 When in 2012 Grayson Perry went to Wearside to film his All in the Best Possible Taste episode about working-class values, he subjected a patriotic local Sunderland supporter to some interesting, if awkward, questions as to what exactly made him so proud of his city.\par \par \uc2 "We've got the beautiful beaches, a beautiful football team," said the Mackem bloke, who was in his 20s and gave the impression of both believing what he said and laughing at himself for saying it. "Everything about Sunderland you just love! The history as well! Our mining history, the shipyards history which is all gone now, but we're still living the tradition. I mean my dad's still a coal miner to this day."\par \par \uc2 "What else?" asked Perry.\par \par \uc2 "Well . . . the heritage."\par \par \uc2 "But that's the past."\par \par \uc2 "Well, we're proud that we're still here. We're still together aren't we? We might have nothing now but we still have the . . . generosity."\par \par \uc2 "Is that the industry now, generosity?"\par \par \uc2 "Yes!" replied the man victoriously. "Generosity - and call centres!"\par \par \uc2 If anyone had been looking for the perfect 75-word encapsulation of the feeling that might be otherwise described as "being from the British provinces and loving your home because it feels uniquely wonderful even though its old distinctive wonders are being replaced by huge crinkly tin sheds and branches of Subway" then surely this was it. Only a Newcastle United supporter could have failed to sympathise with the bloke by the end; how can you dislike someone who, grasping for pride-inspiring qualities, comes up with "generosity"?\par \par \uc2 Perry seemed to read the exchange as evidence of working-class culture's excessive nostalgia and old-fangledness, but to me this seemed slightly, well, ungenerous. What the man was trying to say was that the old industries themselves might have gone, but they left behind them a set of enduring attitudes and values. That may or may not be true, but insofar as those attitudes and values were about improving yourself and helping your fellows, then this was at the very least a laudable hope. And when he talked about "living the tradition", that hope began edging towards something bigger, getting closer to a venerable old idea about the working and lower-middle classes' place in history. It is an idea that in recent years has been neglected, then hijacked and now may be beginning to be reclaimed.\par \par \uc2 This is the idea, once prevalent in areas such as the Sunderland shipyards and north-east pit villages, that while life in industrial communities could be grim, it exceeded that of the old agricultural rural settlements in its potential for self-betterment and social progress through hard work and communal endeavour. Or, to put it another way, that if members of the working classes clubbed together, they could determine their own history.\par \par \uc2 In The Making of the English Working Class, EP Thompson described it as the "collective self-consciousness" that was "the great spiritual gain of the industrial revolution", and allowed the working class "to be present in its own making". Richard Hoggart recognised it in The Uses of Literacy when he touched on the sense of advancement felt in the 1950s by people who still remembered their rural peasant ancestry. In a 1968 book called Working Class Community, the educationalist Brian Jackson attributed to it the fact that "industrial workers over 10 generations made so much out of such squalor and indignity, [which is] one of the little miracles of British social history".\par \par \uc2 The point was that people were conscious of this ongoing effort to improve their lives and shape the destiny of themselves and future generations. This sounds rather grand, as if shipbuilders and their families sat about in the evening remarking that they wouldn't have been able to afford such terrific kitchen appliances if it hadn't been for the struggles of the Chartists years before. Some did, of course, just as some never thought about it, but in most cases it was usually an imprecise idea latent in day-to-day stories, anecdotes and comparisons.\par \par \uc2 When I think of it, I think of my late grandma, eldest daughter then matriarch of a large mining family, talking about the village in the Dearne Valley in South Yorkshire where my family is from. There were memories, shared at birthday and golden wedding parties, of the Welfare Hall being built with miner's subscriptions in the 1920s. Tales about her sisters leaving the bullying and sexual predations of domestic service for the relative wealth and independence of mill work. Comparisons of the strike of 1984-5 to the lockout of 1926. Anecdotes about Co-op divvies, Christmas clubs and indeed the lending of money between women neighbours when husbands had spent the rent money. I didn't really think about it at the time - wow, great examples of collective self-consciousness, grandma! - but many of her stories were examples of a community being present its own making.\par \par \uc2 I have spent the last seven years interviewing people in South Yorkshire for a book about my family and the Dearne Valley, and I sometimes wonder what exactly happened to that old sense of struggle and self-determination. Predictably, while many over the age of about 40 had, or at least remembered having, my grandma's faith, it tends to be a good deal rarer in those who entered the workforce after the mid-1990s. ("Being working class means very little these days," one male student from Barnsley told me in 2008. "You're either part of the huge range of the middle class, or dole scum. The closest thing to what you're talking about is chav culture.")\par \par \uc2 It is clear that in the mid-20th century my grandma (Winnie Hollingworth nee Parkin, to give her her name) and the children and grandchildren she influenced, lived through a peak in the principle's power and popularity, thanks largely to two world wars. In 1919 when Winnie was nine, she stood on the doorstep of her family's terraced house and watched her father, Walter, limping up the road towards her as her returned at last from his service in the war. Two years earlier he had been awarded the Military Medal for bravery after pulling his CO off enemy barbed wire at Passchendaele. Now, at the age of 30, he was a wreck, partially blinded, back and legs studded with shrapnel, and still barely able to walk after 12 months rehabilitation at a convalescent hospital.\par \par \uc2 Winnie would henceforth spend much of her spare time helping him hobble around the streets of their village. When he returned to his old job as a coalminer, and joined 1920s strikes and lockouts, she was furious at the betrayal of the former heroes with reduced pay and conditions and vilification by the likes of Churchill and Lady Astor. Walter, who died from infections in his spinal wounds in 1933, always believed that justice would come only with a victorious campaign for nationalisation. Winnie, like most other people in mining families, believed it too, and felt vindicated when Clement Attlee's postwar Labour government took the pits into public ownership.\par \par \uc2 In the summer of 1947 she stood with her husband Harry and six-year-old daughter Pauline in Barnsley's Locke Park to hear Attlee's speech to the Yorkshire Miners' Gala. "No one of us can carry on without depending on the work of other members of the community," he said, anticipating the all-in-it-together rhetoric of a quite different PM more than 60 years later. "You in the mining industry are now working not for private profit but for the nation. You have the incentive of your earnings, but you have besides another powerful motive. You are at the forefront of the new society which we are building." My mother remembers standing with her father as he listened to a brass band shortly after the speech that day, and glancing at his face to see him weeping.\par \par \uc2 In stories like these a sense of identity that mixed the personal and the political was passed down through generations, in homes and workplaces. Typically for a mother in that community, Winnie passed them on to her children, and then in the 1970s and 80s to me and my brother, sister and cousins. By then life in the pit villages, with its indoor heating and toilets, foreign holidays and welfare-state provision, had improved beyond her dad's hopes and imaginings. She seemed to believe, though, that these improvements were partly due to the struggles of men like her dad to ensure that future generations avoided the rotten treatment that Walter had suffered.\par \par \uc2 That belief would inspire her grandchildren to meet the challenges of their times. My cousin Gary, first as a builder and then as a miner at Houghton Main, was involved in the union militancy of the early 1970s. He remembers that "when it was going on, we felt like there was almost a sort destiny to it. Our parents and grandparents had struggled, and now that struggle had reached a point where it was our time. It was a question of us getting fairness for everyone at last."\par \par \uc2 Gary, who retrained as a social worker after leaving mining in the early 1990s, remembers the old sense of history beginning to fade with the mass redundancies at collieries, steelworks, mills and factories in the 1980s. Previously, older and younger generations had been thoroughly mixed, and stories and lore percolated down among those with an interest. When redundancies were offered, the older employees tended to leave first, taking with them an old sense of continuity.\par \par \uc2 The process was accelerated by the dispersal of families as people moved away from old industrial areas, the closure of social institutions tied to workplaces and various political measures and cultural trends that discouraged people from thinking of themselves as members of the working class. At Winnie's funeral in 2002, I sat in the village working men's club and looked for a mural, painted above the bar in 1984, depicting scenes from the strike that year. It seemed to have vanished. "Might have been covered over," someone said. "Some people are a bit embarrassed about all that now."\par \par \uc2 Politicians such as Frank Field, who recently suggested the white working classes should attend citizenship ceremonies, often talk about the loss of a sense of identity, but this is glib. The people I know have a pretty clear sense of who they are. The problem is that they happen to be people who a) feel life was easier and richer a couple of decades ago, and b) can't see many longterm solutions to the challenges facing them.\par \par \uc2 Lacking belief in their ability to find solutions, people often resort to grumbling, but every now and then you meet one of the old guard who reminds you of the power of the belief in self-propelled progress. It took a sixtysomething ex-union delegate, for example, to point out that much of the tension concerning \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  could have been dispelled with a second-tier minimum wage set at higher levels for skilled labour. "It'd mean they had something to work towards," he said, "instead of putting all their energy into having a go at the lads they were competing with for low wages. With a problem, you always have to ask each other, 'how can we look forward with this?'"\par \par \uc2 In the last two or three years, more under-40s appear to have become interested in their heritage, in much the same way that the Sunderland bloke was. A similar drift is noted by Stephen Armstrong, author of the The Road to Wigan Pier Revisited, a book in which he retraces the steps George Orwell took to research poverty in depressed industrial towns in 1936. Armstrong did come across people, he says, "particularly older community organisers, who consciously take the spirit of mutual support they remember in the past, and use it to build organisations - credit unions, community centres - that revive it permanently for a younger generation who have grown up not knowing those times. The effects on those helped can be incredible."\par \par \uc2 The challenge for the future, he agrees, is to look at the past not with simple nostalgia for the camaraderie and decency, but with a selective interest in the ways when people actually managed to take leaps forward in terms of living standards. Reconnecting with that past and that faith in a progressive working-class narrative would mean that it became harder for other people to rewrite the past (as Dominic Sandbrook did last year on TV with his argument that the National Union of Mineworkers had a proto-Thatcherite agenda in the 1970s) and the future ("All in it together" - enough said). And it would make for another good answer for Grayson Perry, should he ever revisit Wearside.\par \par \uc2 By the way: the mural had not been obliterated. It was just lost to view when the club steward had the ceiling lowered to save on heating bills. It still sits hidden above the bar, waiting to be rediscovered.\par \par \uc2 Richard Benson's The Valley: A Hundred Years in the Life of a Family is published by Bloomsbury.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 'Everything about Sunderland you just love!' . . .

In the early 60s, when the Pelican list burgeoned, I was Penguin's publicity manager, and then through the 70s the marketing director responsible for the education and academic market. It was a huge privilege to be doing such a wonderful job, and all these years later, to see the effect the books had on an informed readership. I left school at 16 with minimum qualifications, but before I'd even joined the firm I bought the books whenever I'd cash enough for the 2s 6d or 3s 6d a time. My house is now stuffed with them and many are like old friends. Thank you for bringing back so many memories.\par \par \uc2 johnahitchin\par \par \uc2 From the website\par \par \uc2 James Fisher's three volume Bird Recognition may not be the fanciest field guide of the dozens on my birding bookshelves, but it is still there, is still referred to, and was the book that inspired me as a 10-year-old to what became a career in biology. The world will be a better place for more Pelicans.\par \par \uc2 Baldsparrow\par \par \uc2 From the website\par \par \uc2 A map, a pipe and a perfect view\par \par \uc2 It was a real treat to see the old Ordnance Survey one-inch map, illustrated by Ellis Martin, in Rachel Hewitt's heartfelt hymn of praise to paper maps ("Turn around when possible", 19 April). Ellis was my mother's cousin and I remember him from my childhood. As an artist he was entirely a traditionalist, having little time for modernism, but he was also quite playful both in his formal works and in gentle little cartoons. His Christmas card to my parents in 1944 featured one of his favourite map covers, Cleeve Hill in Gloucestershire (clearly visible in your cover illustration of James Walker Tucker's 1936 painting, Hiking). Ellis confided that he'd been able to "wangle a very pleasant week's holiday in Cheltenham to do it one autumn". He'd painted the scene from Nottingham Hill but altered the farmhouse in the foreground to make it a "characteristic Cotswold type". The actual farmhouse was sketched, he admitted, several miles away. In so many of his map covers, Ellis included a pipe-smoking hiker, uncannily like my grandfather, the kind of incidental pleasure that is entirely absent from satnavs, with their robotic instructions.\par \par \uc2 Giles Oakley\par \par \uc2 East Sheen, London\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  and the BBC\par \par \uc2 I am surprised that Ian Jack was surprised by my point on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  in relation to the BBC ("What will happen in 2016", 26 April). As my essay makes clear, the largest part of the BBC's revenue rise in the last 50 years has been down to the shift to smaller households, 29% of which are now single person. Forecasts to 2020 expect the rise in population to be close to the projected rise in household numbers, and for nearly 70% of the population rise to be accounted for by new \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and their families. Many public services experience increased pressure as a result of population rises - schools, health, etc - but the BBC is a pure beneficiary: 95% of new households will take out TV licences, but the additional cost of servicing them is zero. Not for a moment do I suggest that BBC editorial is affected by this undisputed fact: but under a subscription system, there could not possibly be any objection to the BBC deriving benefit from a rising population: it is the criminalisation of evasion which seems to give the BBC an advantage over other public services.\par \par \uc2 David Elstein\par \par \uc2 From the website\par \par \uc2 Send letters to Review, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, N1 9GU. review@theguardian.com.\par \par \uc2 Letters may be edited for reasons of space.\par \par \uc2 Please include a postal address.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140503ea530002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Front: Agents blow whistle on doorstep tactics of Sky's sales team: Claim that rogue agents target vulnerable people Firm says preventing mis-selling is top priority\b0\par\par\uc2 Miles Brignall   \par \uc2 779 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Door-to-door sellers working for Sky are seeking out vulnerable customers and "telling them anything" to get them to sign up for expensive TV, phone and broadband services, a group of Sky's own sales agents have claimed to the Guardian.\par \par \uc2 The agents, who have all worked for the company for over two years, said they have turned whistleblower to expose sales practices increasingly being adopted by colleagues. Rogue agents, they say, are targeting recent \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  with poor English and a patchy understanding of their consumer rights.\par \par \uc2 The sales staff, who knock door-to-door using addresses supplied by Sky bosses, lie to customers about broadband speeds and prices. They also tell potential customers they can get them out of existing \uc2 Virgin Media\uc2  contracts to persuade them to sign up to Sky contracts which often cost more than pounds 100 a month, they claim.\par \par \uc2 The whistleblowers say the culture of "tell the customer anything to get the sale" that was once prevalent in the energy sector is now happening at Sky. At the energy companies a series of mis-selling scandals eventually forced the firms to disband their sales teams. The whistleblowers say some of Sky's sales agents used to work selling gas and electricity door-to-door.\par \par \uc2 One salesman told the Guardian: "Sky agents will target people who don't speak English - recent \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , Polish, eastern European people. We will tell them anything to sell Sky products.\par \par \uc2 "We don't go to expensive areas because there the customer knows the cost of everything. They know the difference between normal broadband or fibreoptic. They would just slam the door in our face and it would be a waste of time . . . so we go to the poorest areas where there are lots of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  that believe everything we tell them."\par \par \uc2 The Sky agents describe being under pressure from their managers to sell, with their whereabouts constantly monitored remotely, and the agents say they are carpeted if they fail to make sales.\par \par \uc2 The agents say they have raised concerns about sales tactics with managers, but were told it is "none of their concern".\par \par \uc2 Responding to the allegations, Sky said: "Preventing mis-selling is the number one priority." It said it had taken its sales operation back in-house three years ago to ensure high standards were practised, and also says it has rigorous training and management systems to prevent mis-selling.\par \par \uc2 The agents, however, describe how rogue agents are able to get round Sky's controls. The sales verification process - in which the agent calls head office to confirm the sale with the customer at their side - can be faked by using a friend to pose as the customer, they claim.\par \par \uc2 The whistleblowers also say that the commission structure, and the fact that every day they are subject to a stream of text messages from managers promising pounds 15 bonuses, encourages those happy to bend the rules.\par \par \uc2 While the energy firms disbanded their field sales operations after a number of high-profile fines and scandals, Sky is one of the few big brands to still use door-to-door sellers.\par \par \uc2 Sky's director of retail sales, Simon Raggett, said:"We take the quality of our door-to-door sales operation extremely seriously. We put significant investment into systems and training, as well as employing multiple checks and controls, to deliver a high quality experience that adheres to strict guidelines.\par \par \uc2 "If we have evidence of our staff not complying with these guidelines we will always conduct a full investigation and take the appropriate action."\par \par \uc2 Ofcom\uc2 , the media regulator, asked the whistleblowers to provide further details of their allegations.\par \par \uc2 It said it takes mis-selling extremely seriously and has "an active monitoring and enforcement programme to ensure providers' compliance with our rules and legislation".\par \par \uc2 Ofcom\uc2  added: "Consumers should complain if they feel they have been a victim of doorstep mis-selling. Anyone with information about any such mis-selling should also bring it to our attention."\par \par \uc2 The allegations come as figures reveal that Sky is fighting to maintain the sales growth of earlier years.\par \par \uc2 In the past week the company said that 70,000 net new customers had joined in the three months to March - down from 152,000 a year earlier. Pre-tax profits were pounds 793m for the nine months to March 2014, down from pounds 966m a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Allegations by staff come as Sky fights to maintain its sales growth Photograph: David Moir/Reuters\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140503ea530000w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader criticised the media for focusing on the party's failings\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage has conceded that Ukip contains \u8220\'20\'1Csome idiots\u8221\'20\'1D, but maintained that media coverage of the controversies surrounding the party in the lead-up to the European elections has been \u8220\'20\'1Ccompletely disproportionate\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Speaking in Dover, Kent, at the launch of Ukip's new billboard campaign for the elections, Mr Farage said that he believed the party\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Csimple\u8221\'20\'1D message would resonate with voters across the UK.\par \par \uc2 Distancing himself from the so-called \u8220\'20\'1Cidiots\u8221\'20\'1D, the Ukip leader claimed he had \u8220\'20\'1Cnever heard\u8221\'20\'1D of a candidate who posted numerous tweets espousing extremist views.\par \par \uc2 And Mr Farage also defended the embattled Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson over the n-word row, saying it was \u8220\'20\'1Cjust typical Clarkson\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account of Harry Perry, standing for Ukip in Offerton, is a stream of Islamophobic and homophobic abuse.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said: \u8220\'20\'1CI've never heard of the bloke until last night. I've no idea who he is.\par \par \uc2 "I think he comes from the north west of England. Clearly his attitude and views are entirely inconsistent with being a member of Ukip. Simple."\par \par \uc2 He added: "I could show you 14 elected councillors from the Lib Dem, Labour and Conservative parties who haven't just said nasty things, they've been convicted this year of nasty things.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAnd yet it never makes a national headline. I am not saying we haven't had our problems, we have.\par \par \uc2 "Every party has these kinds of problems but there is a completely disproportionate media spotlight on what goes wrong in Ukip compared to the others."\par \par \uc2 April 2014: A month of Ukip gaffes and controversies\par \par \uc2 Responding to Prime Minster David Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s comments about not needing to discredit Ukip as they do a "good enough job themselves", Mr Farage laughed and said: "It was good clever politic. I'll give him that. Yeah, we've got some idiots.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat is happening here is the establishment are singling out a handful of unpleasant comments made by Ukip people and yet the other parties do these things and say these things it would appear with impunity.\par \par \uc2 "The other thing Mr Cameron said is that I was a chicken.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWell, I'll tell you what Dave, why don't you come on telly and do a debate with me?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s campaign poster features a picture of the White Cliffs of Dover with an escalator running up the middle and the slogan: \u8220\'20\'1CNo border. No control. The EU has opened our borders to 4,000 people every week.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The poster adds: \u8220\'20\'1CTake back control of our country.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader believes his party's \u8220\'20\'1Csimple\u8221\'20\'1D message about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  will get the public, if not politicians, talking.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI've been trying over the course of the last few weeks to have a national debate on this issue.\par \par \uc2 "They point blank refuse to engage with me. On Monday this billboard will be going up on hundreds of sites right across the United Kingdom, and even if the politicians don't want to discuss this issue, I think this very simple, straightforward message is going to get the public talking about it," he said.\par \par \uc2 He added: "We may well be on the edge of the biggest migratory wave yet to come to these shores and the \uc2 British Government\uc2  is impotent, there is nothing we can do.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe only way to solve this Mr Cameron, and Mr Miliband, is for the British people to have a referendum so that we can discuss this openly and vote on it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Asked about the Clarkson row, Mr Farage said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe more controversial Jeremy Clarkson is, the more people watch his programme, and the more money the BBC makes out of marketing a show that sells globally and makes them a fortune.\par \par \uc2 "I would think it's just typical Clarkson, getting very, very close to the line of being offensive but perhaps not quite going over it," he said.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Press Association\par \par \uc2 Read more: Man charged with assault after Farage hit with eggIs Ukip a racist party?Ukip condemns James Elgar's 'deplorable' tweets\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140503ea53001bc\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Birmingham couple ordered to pay back nearly \u163\'00\'A3400,000 in false benefits claims\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jane Tyler   \par \uc2 367 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par 15:02\par \uc2 birminghammail.co.uk\par \uc2 EVEMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Trinity Mirror   \par \par \uc2 Visa fraud operation saw Syed Ahsan Yousuf and Jabin Bi jailed for a total of nearly seven years\par \par \uc2 A husband and wife team who supplied illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  with fake documents to help them stay in the UK have been ordered to pay almost \u163\'00\'A3400,000.\par \par \uc2 The visa fraud operation saw Syed Ahsan Yousuf, 40, and Jabin Bi, 49, jailed for a total of nearly seven years.\par \par \uc2 Now an investigation by \uc2 Birmingham City Council\uc2  has found the couple had also fraudulently claimed benefits and had also submitted false mortgage applications.\par \par \uc2 Yousuf, and wife Bi, were jailed in March last year after they admitted charging \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  thousands of pounds in return for forged documents.\par \par \uc2 At a court hearing in Birmingham Yousuf, of Ivor Road, Sparkhill, was ordered to repay \u163\'00\'A3260,000, and Bi, of Bevington Road, Aston, was ordered to repay \u163\'00\'A3120,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act.\par \par \uc2 The scam was uncovered after several applications to remain in the UK were received by the Home Office which were all paid for from the same bank accounts.\par \par \uc2 The applications were initially for long term residency, based on being in the UK for over 14 years, and were followed by applications for residence cards based on civil partnerships between EU and non-EU nationals.\par \par \uc2 A Home Office criminal investigation team traced the bank accounts to Yousuf and Jabin Bi.\par \par \uc2 During the investigation it came to light that Yousuf and Bi were also involved in benefit fraud and fraudulent mortgage applications.\par \par \uc2 Yousuf was jailed for four years and ten months and Bi was jailed for two years after both pleaded guilty to the offences.\par \par \uc2 Andy Radcliffe, from Home Office Criminal Investigations, said: \u8220\'20\'1CYousuf and Bi thought they could profit from exploiting \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 desperation to stay in the UK. They were wrong.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis case shows we work closely with local councils to bring before the courts those involved in scams that aim to defraud both the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system and taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAnd our investigations do not stop once we have secured a conviction.

\par\par \uc2 Frontpage\par \b \uc2 Inside Westminster: Exposing Ukip's nasty side does not blunt the party's appeal\b0\par\par\uc2 Andrew Grice   \par \uc2 995 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par 09:29\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 What spooks the Tories is the threat Ukip poses to their hopes in 2015\par \par \uc2 A picture of the white cliffs of Dover, with a welcoming escalator for migrants superimposed, features in a new advertising blitz by the UK Independence Party launched yesterday. \u8220\'20\'1CNo border. No control. The EU has opened our borders to 4,000 people every week,\u8221\'20\'1D is the poster\u8217\'20\'19s message.\par \par \uc2 Crude, shameless but probably effective, confirming that Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s campaign for this month\u8217\'20\'19s European elections is more about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  than Europe. If the latest posters cause a row like the party\u8217\'20\'19s first wave of advertising, Ukip will be delighted because that would merely spread its message to a wider audience.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps politicians in other parties will think twice this time before branding Ukip \u8220\'20\'1Cracist\u8221\'20\'1D. Many agree with David Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s 2006 description of Ukip as \u8220\'20\'1Cfruitcakes, loonies, closet racists\u8221\'20\'1D but, like the Prime Minister himself, now realise that you cannot insult the millions of people attracted by Ukip.\par \par \uc2 The lesson of the past two weeks is that even exposing the nasty views of Ukip candidates and activists does not blunt the party\u8217\'20\'19s appeal. Clearly the man in the Dog and Duck has some sympathy with them, especially on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Politicians, with the honourable exception of Nick Clegg in his broadcast debates with Mr Farage, seem frightened to make a positive case for \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . It\u8217\'20\'19s a win-win for Ukip. Even a controversy over the Ukip leader\u8217\'20\'19s expenses as an MEP failed to puncture his bubble. Like Alex Salmond in Scotland, Mr Farage is very good at playing a victim of the mainstream parties ganging up on him.\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives\u8217\'20\'19 dilemma over how to combat Ukip is acute. \u8220\'20\'1COur biggest challenge now is not the economy but how to get the \u8216\'20\'18kippers\u8217\'20\'19 back,\u8221\'20\'1D one senior Tory minister admitted. \u8220\'20\'1CThe trouble is that they don\u8217\'20\'19t want to come back. We don\u8217\'20\'19t know what to do.\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Cameron is part of the problem: to many Ukip supporters, he is a perfect symbol of the modern Britain they detest, as they crave a better yesterday and tell Tory focus groups: \u8220\'20\'1COur country is not what it was\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The Tories\u8217\'20\'19 real concern is not the 22 May Euro elections. They are resigned to coming third. What really spooks them is Ukip making the difference between them winning or losing the general election, which takes place a year from next Wednesday. Ukip will be the wildest of wild cards. Tory number crunchers reckon that a 6 per cent share of the vote for Ukip could deprive the Tories of key marginal seats in the North and Midlands and hand victory to Labour. Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party currently averages 13 per cent when voters are asked how they would vote in a general election. Although not all Ukip supporters are former Tories, they are more likely to be than to have switched from another party. It seems that Ukip takes four votes from the Tories for every one it gets from Labour.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CVote Ukip, get Miliband\u8221\'20\'1D is certainly a message we will hear. But sensible Tories doubt it will pay huge dividends. A poll of 20,000 people by Lord Ashcroft, the Conservatives\u8217\'20\'19 former deputy chairman, found that only one in 10 Ukip supporters believed both that a vote for the party increased the chances of a Miliband victory and said this might make a difference to how they would vote. Many Farage followers clearly regard Mr Miliband as no worse than Mr Cameron or simply do not believe what the mainstream parties tell them. Similarly, the Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s pledge of a 2017 in/out referendum on Europe, which he reiterated yesterday, may not be the antidote to Ukip he hoped.\par \par \uc2 The Tories are trying to woo Ukip voters in other ways. George Osborne\u8217\'20\'19s March Budget, with its measures on pensions and savings, targeted the \u8220\'20\'1Cgrey vote\u8221\'20\'1D but was also aimed at the \u8220\'20\'1CUkip vote\u8221\'20\'1D. One senior Tory described it as \u8220\'20\'1Cshort-term politics dressed up as long-term economics\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 This \u8220\'20\'1Cgeneration game\u8221\'20\'1D might not work as well as the Tories hope. True, the over-60s do turn out to vote in much greater numbers than younger people. But they may be less selfish than the Tories think; they do care about whether their children and grandchildren get a good university education without being saddled with debt, decent jobs and a foot on the housing ladder.\par \par \uc2 We know that Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s appeal is strongest among white men over 60. If the Tories are tempted to pander to Ukip voters, they risk writing off younger people \u8211\'20\'13 who will vote in greater numbers as they get older. Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s party already has a \u8220\'20\'1Cproblem with women\u8221\'20\'1D, among whom Labour enjoys a bigger lead than among men. Chasing Ukip would be a turn-off for many women, making it even harder for the Tories to close the gender gap. Then there are the ethnic minorities. Lack of support amongst them was a big factor in Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s failure to win a majority in 2010. Playing the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  card to match Ukip would hardly endear the Tories to this group.\par \par \uc2 If the Tories get this wrong, demographic change (including the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ) could leave them agonising over whether they can ever win a majority again \u8211\'20\'13 just as the Republicans did after Mitt Romney\u8217\'20\'19s defeat by Barack Obama in 2012. An estimated 88 per cent of Romney voters were white.\par \par \uc2 Of course, when an election looms, all parties are tempted to put short-term tactics first. But Mr Cameron would be wise to play it long rather than try to \u8220\'20\'1Cout-kip\u8221\'20\'1D the \u8220\'20\'1Ckippers\u8221\'20\'1D. As one Tory moderniser put it: \u8220\'20\'1CWe need to chase the voters of the future, not chase people who want to turn the clock back to the past.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140502ea5200338\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw59\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal885\pichgoal600

I don't really give a ****. It was just a random target. I'm not even from GB," the hacker replied.\par \par \uc2 The user responded:"Wow. OK well it's a far right anti \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  highly racist organisation you've just hacked. Perhaps reverse their policies ;)"\par \par \uc2 Surprised by this information, the hacker then suggested he pass control of the account over to the better informed user instead, who declined.\par \par \uc2 The header image for the account was also changed by the hacker to a screen grab of a message sent to leader Nick Griffin.\par \par \uc2 Anonymous is a loose group of "hacktivists" who came to the fore in 2010 in the wake of the emergence of Julian Assange's \uc2 Wikileaks\uc2  website.\par \par \uc2 Anonymous began by aiming DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks on websites, like the credit card firm Visa, who had withdrawn services from \uc2 Wikileaks\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But it has gradually changed into a grouping which claims to battle government surveillance and attempts to police the internet.\par \par \uc2 Last month Anonymous claimed to have disrupted access to the Home Office website and defaced almost 500 websites in China.\par \par \uc2 A message put on the hacked sites said the attack was carried out to protest against the Chinese government's strict control of its citizens.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140503ea530012x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 If you haven't heard of Jill Stephenson there's a fair chance you'll read more of her in the months ahead, should you ever buy newspapers or stray into places on the internet where the independence referendum is discussed. The Professor Emerita of History at Edinburgh University has become one of the most compelling voices in support of the Union \u8212\'20\'14 as an essayist, letter writer, blogger, a member of the FT's readers' panel. In every forum her voice is loud and clear. To paraphrase: "A victory for Scottish nationalism would be a disaster for Scotland."\par \par \uc2 In her main sphere of conflict \u8212\'20\'14 "hours every day" on social media \u8212\'20\'14 it is not always a popular view. Professor Stephenson, 70, is Edinburgh born and has lived in the city almost all her life but she is not Scottish enough for her online critics. "I feel I am an alien in my own country now, because I am being made to feel I am not Scottish," she said. "I am very proud to be Scottish but not proud of the way some Scots are behaving. I do not see the point of breaking up the Union, I just don't see it.\par \par \uc2 "I was a Scottish Nationalist when I was a child. I was in the Nat Club when I was a first-year student. They had a flat in Potterow where you could go for coffee and I hung out with them for a while. I got over it quite quickly."\par \par \uc2 She and other academics such as Adam Tomkins, Professor of Law at Glasgow University, are the most articulate people for the Union cause, not necessarily because they wanted to, but because they felt they had to, since Better Together, the official campaign for a "no" vote, was simply not good enough.\par \par \uc2 "The cerebral approach is admirable," she said, "but it doesn't win votes." Her complaints are legion. On the day when the SNP's "untenable" childcare policy was falling apart, Better Together was too preoccupied with celebrity supporters to exploit the opportunity. They don't even moderate their \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page properly, to prevent its "wall" being smeared with nationalist posts, she said. "There are a lot of people disenchanted with Better Together but not with the cause. It is a matter of great frustration for people who are desperate to fight for the Union."\par \par \uc2 Her particular focus is on tackling the nationalists' "mythology", their attempts to "detoxify" independence. She explained: "The notion that independence will not affect the things you hold dear \u8212\'20\'14 pensions, currency, universities, the BBC \u8212\'20\'14 when the opposite is true. They are trying to persuade people that these things will continue. In reality we will be a foreign country as far as the rest of the UK is concerned.\par \par \uc2 "Somehow they contrive to say: 'We will not be part of the UK but we will be British.' It's nonsense. At first I thought they were misguided. Now I believe they are being deliberately misleading."\par \par \uc2 The "myth" of Scotland's easy journey to EU membership rankles as does "the notion we would enjoy the same benefits as before". Neither position holds water, she said. "We would not get the UK's rebate or opt-outs negotiated by the UK in the early 1970s and subsequently \u8212\'20\'14 these are not available to new members.\par \par \uc2 "Application conditions would require a commitment to join the euro, at some point. The SNP's stated \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy would require a border. By contrast, Ireland's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy is closely aligned with the UK's. A small country, a new entrant, would not be able to dictate terms."\par \par \uc2 On VAT, she said: "It would have to be at least at five per cent but possibly 15 per cent, on food, children's clothes and the other 52 items on which the UK is currently able to zero-rate VAT. Better Together should have hammered home the advantages Britain enjoys. Paying VAT on food and children's clothes would certainly raise the cost of living in 'iScotland'."\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the greatest myth perpetuated by the nationalists, she said, was the notion that the unionists are fighting the more negative campaign. "Putting the Union side in the position of having to answer the question [on the ballot paper] in the negative was a mistake. There is nothing so negative as trying to break up the Union."\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140503ea53000ll\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 THE WEEK'S BEST FILMS\par \par \uc2 Monsieur Lazhar (2011)\par \par \uc2 FILM4, 11.00AM ****\par \par \uc2 An Algerian \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  (Mohamed Fellag) offers his services to a school when he learns of a popular school teacher committing suicide in her classroom. While trying to help the children cope with their grief, he also has a secret tragedy of his own and is in a constantly precarious position as a refugee. Philippe Falardeau's film is both raw and thought\u8211\'20\'13provoking, led by a stellar performance from Fellag.\par \par \uc2 The Man in the Iron Mask (1998)\par \par \uc2 5*, 6.30PM **\par \par \uc2 Randall Wallace (Braveheart) made his directorial debut with this loose adaptation of Alexandre Dumas's 1848 novel. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in a duel role as the title character and villain, though isn't convincing as either. The ageing musketeers (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, G\u233\'00\'E9rard Depardieu and Gabriel Byrne) plot how to overcome the brutal King Louis XIV (DiCaprio) using his secret twin brother.\par \par \uc2 Unknown (2011)\par \par \uc2 FILM4, 9.00PM **\par \par \uc2 Roman Polanski didn't direct this delirious Euro\u8211\'20\'13pudding, but he might have done, if forcefed the wrong kind of mushroom and reminded about his 1988 thriller, Frantic. Liam Neeson has the comparable role of a biotech scientist visiting Berlin, who mislays his passport, all proof of his identity, and the plot. His wife (January Jones, flubbing cool Hitchcock blonde duties) denies all knowledge. Clunky and laughable but never dull.\par \par \uc2 The Life of David Gale (2003)\par \par \uc2 ITV3, 11.10PM ***\par \par \uc2 Kate Winslet, Kevin Spacey and Laura Linney all deliver expectedly fine performances in this gripping but convoluted thriller from Alan Parker. David Gale (Spacey), an opponent of capital punishment, ends up, with bitter irony, on death row after being found guilty of the rape and murder of a fellow activist. Gale agrees to tell his story to a nervy journalist (Winslet), who's convinced he's innocent.\par \par \uc2 The New World (2005)\par \par \uc2 FILM4, 1.10AM ***\par \par \uc2 This vivid retelling of the Pocahontas story stars Q'orianka Kilcher as the young Indian chief's daughter and Colin Farrell as the English captain with whom she has a passionate affair. Terrence Malick's magnificent visual imagination is in full flight and there is glorious cinematography throughout, but the self\u8211\'20\'13indulgent slow pacing means that it is perhaps more to be admired than enjoyed.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140503ea53000cg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

Belle was a beautiful, young, mixedrace woman, adopted and treated tenderly by the family of Lord Mansfield. As the Lord Chief Justice of England he presided over the "Zong" case, a claim against the insurers of a shipping company for the deliberate drowning at sea of 132 slaves, which laid a legal foundation for the abolition of slavery in Britain. Belle is an attractive figure in English high society and her poignant story contrasts with the dramatic legal issues scrupulously upheld by Mansfield. The theatrical zest of the narrative, which is a tie-in with a movie of the same name out next month, holds it all together.\par \par \uc2 Creativity, Inc: Overcoming the Unseen Forces that Stand in the Way of True Inspiration by \uc2 Ed Catmull\uc2  with Amy Wallace Bantam, 344pp \u163\'00\'A320 * \u163\'00\'A316; ebook \u163\'00\'A39.99\par \par \uc2 In the words of a Charlie Rich song, the hippest guy in town is fast-talking, slow-walking, good-looking Mohair Sam. \uc2 Ed Catmull\uc2 , who founded Pixar Animation with Steve Jobs and \uc2 John Lasseter\uc2  in 1986, is the Mohair Sam of computer animation. He is the president of "Creativity Inc", the geeky wizard hired by George Lucas to merge movie-making with technology and the creative alchemist who brought Finding Nemo, Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. to the screen. He is the genius who has won nearly 30 Oscars and made several billion dollars by ... well, here's his shtick on the trick to combining art, business and motivation. The commercial strategies are the same for any product. But it sounds more cool fun at Pixar's state-of-the-art San Francisco campus than anywhere else.\par \par \uc2 Some Desperate Glory: the First World War the Poets Knew by Max Some Egremont Picador, 336pp \u163\'00\'A320 *18\par \par \uc2 The names of the warrior poets of the First World War are memorialised in our culture.\par \par \uc2 For a century, their poetry has coloured our perception of the Great War, as though they wrote with one sorrowful, disappointed, perhaps inglorious voice. Here, however, we read some hundred poems in the very different voices, year by year from 1914 to 1918, of 11 young soldier poets \u8212\'20\'14 Thomas, Owen, Sassoon, Gurney, Graves, Grenfell, Brooke, Blunden, Rosenberg, Nichols and Sorley. As curator of this anthology, Egremont sets each year of poems in the progress of the war and in the biographical context of the hopes, experiences and emotions of their makers. We mark the making of them as men and follow their shifting visions. This is what it was like for them to be in the front line.\par \par \uc2 Iain Finlayson\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140503ea53000h0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 20 YEARS OF CHUNNEL VISION\b0\par\par\uc2 Benedict Brogan   \par \uc2 1,424 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph\par \uc2 DT\par \uc2 1; National\par 29\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Reporting from a highly protected spot 15 miles from the shores of both Britain and France, Benedict Brogan explores the impact of the Channel Tunnel on our relationship with Europe\par \par \uc2 The only place where it is possible to have one foot in England and the other in France is in a concrete tunnel that is dry, dark, and mostly quiet. Modest plastic signs on each side say "mid point" and "point median", and the grey walls are covered in the graffiti of the workers who built it. "Vive l'Ecosse libre!" "Deutschland uber alles" and "David Cameron" stand out, although no politician has ever come this far, and for good reason.\par \par \uc2 The land border between Britain and France is seldom visited, and there is no commemorative plaque or engraving. One of the most protected spots in Europe \u8211\'20\'13 it is not open to the public \u8211\'20\'13 is deep beneath the Channel, about 15 miles from either shore. Every few minutes a train thunders past in one of the running tunnels either side. The roar echoes through the foot\u8211\'20\'13thick steel access doors set every 300 yards or so. Then it is quiet again. The Channel Tunnel, which marks its 20th anniversary on Tuesday, is remarkable yet mundane, our permanent connection to Europe via 30 miles of jaw\u8211\'20\'13dropping achievement that nobody ever sees.\par \par \uc2 Plenty of people use it, of course. Record numbers in fact \u8211\'20\'13 20 million a year, more than 300 million so far, and growing. But aside from a glimpse of the entrance as their train enters the tunnel, and the flicker of emergency lights through the window, there is nothing to see, certainly nothing that gives an idea of the ambition of the thing.\par \par \uc2 Even the passenger terminals at either end, the vast one at Coquelles, and the small one at Cheriton wedged between the Kent escarpment and the motorway, do little to convey the epic effort of punching through the dense, watertight blue marl between the two coasts. Yes, there is the odd clue \u8211\'20\'13 the armed guards, the movement sensors, the funny little remotecontrolled access carts, the sign that says "Beware of adders" (adders?) \u8211\'20\'13 but for the most part it is dingy concrete, unremarkable sheds and lots of electric cabling. For so many of us, lorry drivers to business travellers to families going on holiday, it has become just another service, like water out of the tap, to be assumed rather than admired.\par \par \uc2 The fact that it is taken for granted, however, is a testament to how easily we have adjusted to the idea of being linked to the Continent after a splendid isolation that had lasted since the last ice age.\par \par \uc2 A few miles into the access tunnel there is a reminder of how the dream of an under\u8211\'20\'13sea route is centuries\u8211\'20\'13old: one short section is the tunnel begun under Edward Heath and halted by Harold Wilson in 1974, the date visible on the iron casements; behind them is the Victorian tunnel started in the 1870s, and sealed off. Once, the idea that a tunnel might be used by an invasion force put paid to the idea: Churchill ordered the Royal Navy to look out for muddy water as sign that the German were burrowing towards us.\par \par \uc2 It turned out differently of course.\par \par \uc2 The traffic is the other way. About 85 per cent of the cars using the drive\u8211\'20\'13on, drive\u8211\'20\'13off shuttle service are Brits invading Europe, confirmation of our taste for foreign adventure. It is the Continentals who are insular. The capital\u8211\'20\'13tocapital Eurostar service now commands 90 per cent of the traffic between London, Paris and Brussels, to such an extent that the company is accused of complacently milking its monopoly. The French paid for it \u8211\'20\'13 their private investors put up most of the cash \u8211\'20\'13 but despite predictions to the contrary, it turned out to be the island\u8211\'20\'13dwellers who came to love the tunnel most.\par \par \uc2 Those of us who were at the opening ceremony in Calais in 1994 remember the formalities, the sight of the Queen riding in her Rolls\u8211\'20\'13Royce with the sphinx\u8211\'20\'13like Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Mitterrand beside her, but most particularly the way the then French president used the occasion to have a dig at Britain's backwards rail system. He had raced up to the tunnel on France's high\u8211\'20\'13speed train network, the 186mph TGV, while the Queen had been left to clatter through south London on ancient \uc2 British Rail\uc2  track. Visitors who had sped through France, he observed, would have plenty of time to appreciate the beauty of the English countryside as they trundled towards London.\par \par \uc2 He was right of course. It would be another decade before the highspeed rail link to St Pancras was opened. Early plans to run Eurostar services straight through from Edinburgh and Glasgow to Paris and beyond were shelved, even though the trains were ordered (they are now used on French routes). After the ceremony he chose to fly back to Paris, but the point was made. Now it is possible to imagine how, after the tunnel and HS1, the new highspeed line to the North will one day too be little more than a mundane service, remarkable but ignored.\par \par \uc2 Its French champions saw the Channel Tunnel as a way of taming the Brits. In 1994, the French rejoiced that Britain was at last linked to Europe. Mitterrand declared the tunnel "a major trump card reinforcing the EU", while Le Figaro proclaimed the end of "the divorces and quarrels through the centuries". John Major proclaimed it a potent symbol of "Britain's new role in Europe", just as his party was tearing itself apart over the issue.\par \par \uc2 To them, the tunnel mattered more as a political symbol. Yet it quickly proved itself to be an economic success that aided trade and provided greater opportunities for British businesses to take goods and services to Europe. Of course the \u163\'00\'A310 billion cost was borne entirely by the private sector, and those who put up the money lost their shirts when the company went belly up and had to be restructured.\par \par \uc2 Boris Johnson, more presciently perhaps, predicted "the contamination will be in reverse": the tunnel would allow Britain to export its ideas across Europe.\par \par \uc2 Some things come the other way of course. \uc2 Eurotunnel\uc2  uses French electricity, which is cheaper and cleaner, and is completing an inter\u8211\'20\'13connector \u8211\'20\'13 a giant cable through the tunnel \u8211\'20\'13 that will allow Britain to import even more energy from France. The tunnel uses just half its capacity. Projections are for freight use to continue expanding \u8211\'20\'13 more rolling stock has been ordered. A Brussels demand for more competition on inter\u8211\'20\'13city routes means German railways will soon start services to London, putting Eurostar under pressure to offer cheaper prices and more routes.\par \par \uc2 Eurotunnel\uc2  is upgrading its terminals to deal with crowds and the holiday jams caused by the Government's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  crack\u8211\'20\'13down. Plans to check the passports of every passenger on exit as well as entry has alarmed the company, which predicts longer waits and complaints from other EU countries who will ask why, when consumers expect to move quicker, things have slowed down.\par \par \uc2 Twenty years on, Britain has moved closer to breaking its political connection with Europe. Launching his European election campaign yesterday, David Cameron repeated his promise of an in\u8211\'20\'13out referendum in 2017. By the time the tunnel marks its quarter\u8211\'20\'13century, we may have voted to cut ourselves off from the EU. Yet deep underground, where the French and British engineers monitor the tunnel round the clock and tend to its systems, speak an improvised franglais and drive on the left in French cars, the tunnel feels a lot more permanent.\par \par \uc2 Even Margaret Thatcher, who gave the project the go\u8211\'20\'13ahead, when she saw the tunnel, said: "Every generation has to do something exciting that will affect the future. This is wonderful, even better than I thought it would turn out."\par \par \uc2 Of course, few back then knew that the planners had called in a senior British Army officer to identify how to blow up the tunnel and make it unusable in an emergency. To this day, a plan exists that would allow Britain to seal itself off from the Continent again. Wisely, though, the builders insisted the damage should be reversible, and that the tunnel be capable of being reopened within a month. Next week, the Channel Tunnel will mark not just our connection to the Continent, but how hard it is to break.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140503ea530006u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  made a spirited attack on Ukip and its leader, Nigel Farage, yesterday as he launched the European election campaign, in which the Conservatives are expected to come a distant third.\par \par \uc2 The prime minister, who regularly sidesteps talking about Ukip, said the party was "all talk and no delivery", which could not deliver a referendum.\par \par \uc2 A YouGov poll at the weekend put the Tories in third place in the Euroelections, with 19 per cent support, well behind Ukip on 31 per cent and Labour on 28 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Beginning the Conservative campaign at a JCB vehicle plant in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, Mr Cameron took aim at his rivals: "I don't need to discredit Ukip \u8212\'20\'14 they do a good enough job themselves. Their own leader admits they 'cannot change a thing in Brussels'. This is who we're up against: Labour \u8212\'20\'14 all short-term gimmicks and no long-term plan. Ukip \u8212\'20\'14 all talk and no delivery.\par \par \uc2 "The choice is clear: if you want a serious party with a credible long-term plan and a party that's delivering on that plan, then you only have one choice: you have got to vote Conservative."\par \par \uc2 Ukip responded to the Tory launch with another stark campaign poster highlighting \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from the EU.\par \par \uc2 It shows an escalator running from the English Channel up the White Cliffs of Dover with the slogan: "No Border. No Control. The EU has opened our borders to 4,000 people a week." Mr Farage said: "This is, in my view, the most powerful image of the entire European election campaign. It is designed to bring home to the British public just what membership of the EU means as regards controlling our own borders."\par \par \uc2 After launching his campaign, the prime minister took time out to meet the teenager with incurable cancer who has raised more than \u163\'00\'A33 million for charity.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron visited 19-year-old Stephen Sutton, who is being treated for multiple tumours at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Mr Sutton was later discharged. During the visit, lasting about 15 minutes, Mr Sutton, whose fundraising for the \uc2 Teenage Cancer Trust\uc2  has won backing from people around the world, posed for pictures alongside the prime minister, his mother, Jane, and the consultant treating him. Afterwards Mr Cameron said: "He's amazing, just an inspiration."\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Ed Miliband endured a dressing-down over the state of the \uc2 NHS\uc2  in Wales from relatives of patients. He was repeatedly challenged over why the Labour-led administration in Wales refuses to hold a public inquiry similar to that held into failures in England.\par \par \uc2 Gareth Williams\uc2 , whose mother, Lilian, died two years ago, said: "The scandal in Mid-Staffordshire in England resulted in a public inquiry. We desperately need one in Wales. The first minister, \uc2 Carwyn Jones\uc2 , has repeatedly refused to hold one. I'm now calling on you, Mr Miliband, to back our calls for a public inquiry in Wales. The way in which hundreds of patients are being neglected is a national scandal."\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140503ea53000cl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

That's when he's not trailing behind celebrity SUVs that are taking tots home from play dates.\par \par \uc2 Vlad, 40, 6ft 3in, is a pap, singular for paparazzi, the despised shooters who bring you all pictures you claim to loathe but actually stare at online for hours. Vlad's Mercedes is hidden because he doesn't want another pap to jump his shot. Paps are known by their nicknames - Bam-Bam, Zazy, Top Hat Rick and Mexican Vlad, not to be confused with our Vlad, who is also known as the Black Russian.\par \par \uc2 He's one of hundreds of photographers who represent a tripped-out rainbow of the American dream - Haitian-Americans like Vlad, aviator-wearing Persians, Brazilians with questionable \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  status, Mexican-Americans in broken-down vans, Eurotrash in leather jackets and the occasional Caucasian dude on a motorcycle - trying to make a living on anywhere from $10,000 to $150,000 a year by photographing every move an A, B or D-lister makes, short of using the toilet. Some of the stars hate them, some of the stars use them in a now estimated billion-dollar business, where millions of insatiable readers scan websites, magazines and television shows for the tiniest scrap of information on the second lead in a reality show. Right now, Vlad's waiting on British pop singer Jessie J to emerge and head to a nearby recording studio. Vlad checks her Instagram page and sees that she's at the rooftop pool, so it will be a while. He starts talking about his encounter with Harrelson in 2009, as hip-hop blasts from his radio. At the time he was shooting for the gossip website TMZ and caught Harrelson and his daughter coming off a flight.\par \par \uc2 "I'm asking questions, trying to keep it light. 'Hey, Woody, so how you feelin', man? I know you must be a little out of it, but... are those pants made out of hemp?'\par \par \uc2 And the dude bumrushes me and smashes my camera to s***. I'm like, 'Woody, that's assault, that's assault.'" It was Vlad's first meltdown with a star, but it wouldn't be his last. There have been runins with Robert De Niro's driver, Hopper Penn - Sean Penn's son - and actress Amanda Bynes in the past four years. He stops talking. Another pap is walking up, a smile on his face. Vlad won't roll down the window.\par \par \uc2 "That dude is a leech," says Vlad. "He's a virus, yo, a parasite motherf***er. Every f***in' day he just runs around, jumpin' on s***. But his bitch ass will have a f***in' cow if you jump on his s***." He slips into a decent Cockney accent: "Eh! Come on, mate, you're jumping my shot."\par \par \uc2 Vlad speaks in his own personal English Esperanto with made-up phrases - eg, "funky pumper" for a woman's backside - blended through a childhood split between Port-Au-Prince and Flatbush, Brooklyn. The Brit trudges away. Vlad goes back to talking about Woody. Luckily, he had another minicam and started filming Harrelson with that.\par \par \uc2 "He jumps on my back. Now I'm like, 'Dude! Seriously? Come on!' The asshole is piggybacking on me, punching at me. I'm like, 'Word?'" Paps live on situational awareness - a sixth sense anticipating what is going to happen next. Vlad spies a double-decker bus heading down Sunset Boulevard. But this one is different from the tour buses trawling through West Hollywood on the lookout for Kanye West and Kim Kardashian leaving the Chateau Marmont hotel. On the side is a Playboy logo; the seats are filled with dozens of bunnies. Vlad throws the Mercedes into drive.\par \par \uc2 The Brit follows in his SUV. Vlad is displeased. He cuts the dude off and barks more creative obscenities. He catches up to the Playboy bus on Sunset. He jumps out of the car and starts shooting. The girls wave and blow kisses.\par \par \uc2 "Hey, girls, looking lovely." He locks eyes with an Asian bunny. "I like you."\par \par \uc2 It all takes three minutes. Vlad takes the Mercedes back to the London hotel. Oh, yeah, Woody. After Harrelson finally stalked away, Vlad called in to the TMZ office. He told them he'd been attacked, but the office had other concerns. They wanted to know if he had video. (He did.) Vlad's face sags a bit. "This dude just attacked me, and all I hear back is, 'Did you get the shot?' not 'Are you OK?'" The Mercedes is back in position. Vlad stares at the hotel-lobby entrance. And he waits.\par \par \uc2 Vlad's spent much of his twenties and early thirties in New York, doing street marketing for clothing lines such as Bad Boy Productions and Phat Farm. He started taking pictures of his clients and their parties and found he loved it. A mutual friend introduced him to someone at TMZ in 2008, and they gave him a camera. On his first day, he used his height to hoist his camera over a wall and shoot Madonna as she left her house. He was hooked.\par \par \uc2 Vlad became a TMZ star, scoring some of the first pictures and video of a smiling Rihanna after Chris Brown, her boyfriend at the time, beat her. But the aggressive style that got him noticed as a quick riser in the pap life also became his downfall. A few months after the Harrelson run-in, TMZ fired him because he seemed to enjoy talking to the press. He moved out to Los Angeles with his daughters and their mother because of the weather and the sheer density of celebrities. His kill-or-bekilled attitude followed him. Vlad's blend of persistence and aggression made him more than $100,000 last year, which is on the high end of the pap salary scale.\par \par \uc2 One day, while driving through Beverly Hills, Vlad pulls the car over and whips out his camera. No one is there, just a yard sign for a two-bedroom apartment. "I want to give my daughter a princess room," he whispers. His right leg is covered in a guardian-angel tattoo with both his daughters' names spelled out.\par \par \uc2 Currently, Vlad lives in West Hollywood so he can step out and shoot stars the moment he wakes up, but he only has a one-bedroom. He takes Kaydence to school and picks her up in the afternoon, but she usually sleeps at her mum's. (He also has a 19-year-old daughter, Kasie, in college.) That doesn't mean father and daughter aren't close - they are, in a pap way. There's footage of a Brad Pitt stakeout outside a caf\u233\'00\'E9 in LA where the actor was hosting a birthday party for his daughter. You can see Kaydence on Vlad's shoulders in the mob; they'd been shopping at the same store.\par \par \uc2 Vlad shoots for Splash, one of the largest photo agencies, and gets a 60-40 split on all sales. But except for the obvious stuff - a shot of, say, Bieber emerging from a car in a cloud of cannabis smoke - it's maddening trying to figure out what will sell. A good Gerard Butler shot earned Vlad only 60 bucks, but a crummy photo of Jessica Alba scored him $900 last month. Why?\par \par \uc2 Alba is carrying a \uc2 Christian Dior\uc2  bag, and \uc2 Christian Dior\uc2  bought the picture. Other photos, like Jessie J, have almost no value in the States but will be huge sellers overseas. Sometimes, it's dumb luck. Top Hat Rick found himself immersed in a crowd in Hancock Park when Prince William and \uc2 Kate Middleton\uc2  emerged from the British Consulate-General's house in 2011, and he made $20,000. Older paps make money on their archives, but Vlad has been doing this for only a few years, so there's no iconic shot in his catalogue bringing in dough every month.\par \par \uc2 In the two weeks that I followed Vlad, he abandoned me and his Mercedes on Sunset Boulevard on a Saturday night so he could shoot actress Molly Shannon, berated me for bringing a banana into his ride, fell at singer Chaka Khan's feet, and shot George Clooney on his way to picking up a girlfriend for date night. He also called actor Ashley Tisdale a name not uttered in polite society after the star used her niece as a shield to ward off Vlad and other paps.\par \par \uc2 But let's not get ahead of ourselves. I first met him at King's Road Caf\u233\'00\'E9 in West Hollywood, a quiet restaurant that Vlad semi-hates because he's had to shoot Glee star Jane Lynch there repeatedly.\par \par \uc2 "She's always like, 'Again?'" Well, "had to" is a relative term; paps like Vlad are an OCD bunch of characters. If they see a celeb, they pathologically need to shoot them, even if they just nailed them four hours ago, which is why no celeb believes a pap when he says, "Just one shot, and I'm gone."\par \par \uc2 It was a few days after Vlad had been pulled over by the Beverly Hills Police Department while tailing American Hustle actress Amy Adams. Across the street is a West Elm store where Vlad recently shot actress Isla Fisher. Like many famous people, Fisher has an intuition about paps and somehow sensed Vlad's presence parked outside. She induced a sales clerk to walk out in front of her and even slid in on the passenger side of her car. Vlad still got the picture.\par \par \uc2 "Bbrrraaatt," says Vlad, making a noise that sounds like semiautomatic gunfire. "That picture sold, son, for about 500 bucks." He has an imaginary conversation with Fisher. "You blocked. It sold. Clap. Thank you!" Federico Fellini named a photographer Paparazzo - conjuring the sound made by an annoying, buzzing insect - in his 1960 film La Dolce Vita, and the name has stuck, morphing into the plural paparazzi.\par \par \uc2 It's not an easy life, and it's getting harder. New legislation went into effect in California on January 1, preventing paps from shooting kids in an alarming manner based on their parents' fame. This sucks for the paps, since mom-and-kid shots sell best. The new law was spearheaded by Halle Berry after being swarmed by paps at Los Angeles Airport last year. "Jesus, what is wrong with you people?" she screamed. "That's a child here."\par \par \uc2 In January, actors Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, the parents of a one-year-old, launched a campaign against what they named the "pedorazzi", and proclaimed their refusal to do interviews with outlets that use unauthorised shots of stars' kids.\par \par \uc2 "It's hilarious," says Rick "Top Hat Rick" Mendoza, a pap best known for suing Britney Spears after she ran over his foot. "Kristen comes up with a new hate word - pedorazzi - and goes on this campaign just as her movie Veronica Mars is coming out. What a coincidence! Now who's manipulating who?" in the line of fire Jennifer Buhl, who spent three years as a top LA pap, on the rules of the game Celebrities Our biggest competition because of Instagram and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  - they're now posting shots of themselves, in a bikini or with their baby, for free. What makes a celebrity hot? Beautiful, under 40, on the screen. Pregnancy or being part of a supercouple makes them hotter - take Mila Kunis, it's rumoured she's pregnant and with Ashton Kutcher. Neither of them likes being papped. If they tweet a picture of the baby when it's born it will negate the value of a paparazzi shot.\par \par \uc2 Pricing a newborn If a child is photographed rarely (once in the first year) a picture will make a paparazzo a heck of a lot of money. If the first baby picture is shot on a Tuesday and the second on Wednesday, etc, then a shot will only be worth a few hundred dollars.\par \par \uc2 Exclusivity The longer the exclusive lasts, the more money you make. The last picture of Michael Jackson was an exclusive that would never be trumped. That went for a couple of million dollars.\par \par \uc2 Rates I don't know any pap that's made more than $30,000 on one shot. I was one of the best and I never made more than $8,000 on a shot. I made $8,000 a few times a year. That was Matthew McConaughey on Malibu beach. Bathing suit shots always do well: Jessica Alba was a good one. Kristen Stewart smoking pot. When Robbie Williams came out of rehab I made $5,000.\par \par \uc2 Top target Kim Kardashian makes the paparazzi the most money right now. She's popular all over the world. That's key. When I was shooting a few years ago Paris Hilton would sell everywhere. You might not make ten grand on a photo but you're always making at least a thousand. When there are a lot of paps after her it's called a gang bang. Long lens shots How I caught Kristen Stewart smoking pot.\par \par \uc2 Rising stock The reasons celebrities go up in value are rehab, a new romance or a break-up. Gwyneth Paltrow with another guy would probably make $15,000-plus. Bikini shots Always big sellers. That never changes. Go to Malibu in the summer, get a few in your library. The Kardashians are probably shot in their bikinis too much, but Victoria Beckham would be good. Has she ever been shot in a bikini? You always make money when they're on the beach.\par \par \uc2 So where's the line? There's a popular Hallowe'en spot in West Hollywood called Mr Bones Pumpkin Patch. Glammed-up celeb mums parade their children down slides and past face-painting stands, while paps get their shots from a designated shooting pen. There are now at least 35,000 shots of celebs cavorting in Mr Bones Pumpkin Patch in photo archives. Stars like Matt Damon - who scrupulously guards his kids' privacy - simply don't take them to pap hot zones like Mr Bones. Berry has brought her daughter there many times. That's her right, but it doesn't suggest she's trying to keep a low profile with her kids.\par \par \uc2 "Halle can take her kid there," says Mendoza. "But if she does, I have a right to shoot them. That's America."\par \par \uc2 This is all happening as the world gets smaller. There is less "big game" like Jackie O and Michael Jackson out there, replaced by a bewildering galaxy of feral reality stars, former criminals and famous-people spawn - such as Jackson's son Prince, whose martial-arts lessons regularly attract a dozen paps. Events now move quicker than Vlad's shutter.\par \par \uc2 In the Nineties, you might get a shot of, say, Madonna looking ragged, and you'd have a few days to start a bidding war before selling it to People magazine. Now it's a race to beat the celeb from posting her own photo on Instagram or another pap from uploading the photo to INF or Splash, two of the largest photo agencies, and then the agency selling your competitor's photo before you've even pressed send. You think texting and driving is dangerous? Vlad and other paps shoot, drive and upload simultaneously.\par \par \uc2 "It's become the Wild West out there," says one of Hollywood's top publicists. "Now you have so many more paps trying to bait the client into a fight. I tell my clients, 'Don't try to outrun them, don't fall into their trap.' It's exponentially worse than ten years ago. It's just nuts, and someone is going to get killed."\par \par \uc2 TMZ has not helped. (The company got its name from the "30-mile zone," the area of celebrich LA spinning out from West Hollywood.) TMZ founder Harvey Levin was a lawyer who reported the OJ trial on television before creating Celebrity Justice, tabloid television that focused on the legal snafus of the stars. Starting up TMZ in 2005 was a logical next step.\par \par \uc2 TMZ has taken the illusion of privacy away. Now the paranoid star just assumes someone is always there. Decoy cars and false itineraries are floated to throw TMZ off the scent. And then there's the money. TMZ has the cash to buy off valets and info like flight lists or even the limo list of what celeb is being picked up where and when.\par \par \uc2 A little after 1pm, Jessie J finally appears. An SUV pulls out of the London hotel and Vlad follows. Jessie J is in the back seat. He trails her to Record Plant studios, powering by her on Melrose so he can arrive a minute or two early and set up. He's already on the pavement and shooting when a security guy asks him to let Jessie's mum pass. Vlad consents and then snags Jessie wearing a wig and a tired smile.\par \par \uc2 "Jessie's huge in England," he says. "I'll shoot her every day, and I'll have a complete story to sell."\par \par \uc2 He drives away, but screeches the brakes as a white Range Rover buzzes through an intersection. He flips a U-turn. "Hold on, hold on, hold on, look at it... Yeah, it is! January Jones!" Vlad squints at the number plate and urges other cars to get out of his way. "Yeah, '047.' Move, get the f*** outta the way. Come on, drive, bitch! Come on!"\par \par \uc2 The best paps have hundreds of licence plates committed to memory - one once rattled off to me the numbers for almost every $125,000 Mercedes G wagon in Los Angeles. Some celebs know it and constantly switch cars; Vlad claims he's seen One Direction's Harry Styles driving half a dozen different vehicles. He sticks close to Jones, but not close enough to spook her.\par \par \uc2 "If she has the kid, she's going to, whatchamacallit, a play date. If she's with the kid, it's even better."\par \par \uc2 Vlad might make about $500 for an exclusive Jones shot, but could make twice that for one with her child. The car pulls up to a house in a nondescript neighbourhood. Vlad can see a toddler in a car seat.\par \par \uc2 We sit for 15 minutes, and a woman gets out of the Range Rover, but it's not Jones or her child. She drives off, and we follow some more. Jones creeps a few miles under the speed limit. Vlad giggles.\par \par \uc2 "I love it when people know that you're following them and they drive a certain way."\par \par \uc2 Eventually, Vlad breaks off the chase, reasoning Jones is heading home to Los Feliz, and that won't work. Jones's house has an automatic gate. He won't get anything good. He takes a left and heads for Beverly Hills, where he's heard that Mark Wahlberg is walking around in a sharp suit.\par \par \uc2 But as he heads down Melrose, he sees a crowd of paps gathered outside the Urth Caff\u233\'00\'E9, a trendy health-food restaurant. He jumps out, and the paps whisper Kylie Jenner is on her way. She is the half-sister of Kim Kardashian, which seems slightly less on the fame scale than a movie star, but not in the pap marketplace, where 42-year-old Wahlberg is ancient. "F*** Mark Wahlberg," shouts Vlad as he joins a scrum. "This is worth ten times that."\par \par \uc2 Jenner arrives with a friend, but she pulls her hair down over her face. Vlad is pissed off. It's a commonplace attitude of the paps - indignation when a target refuses to give it up.\par \par \uc2 "Bitch, stop covering up. Let motherf***ers shoot you and get it over with," he mutters. "All this attitude. Someone like Angelina Jolie would just give us the shot - she's beautiful." Vlad doesn't mention that Jenner is 16 and Jolie is 38.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, Vlad does have a point. Celebs who hit the West Hollywood/Beverly Hills quadrant are not exactly trying to keep a low profile. Probably 90 per cent of pap shots in Los Angeles are taken in West Hollywood and Beverly Hills, where Vlad trawls.\par \par \uc2 The ugly secret is, some stars want to be hunted. During the Great Britney Spears Hunt of 2007, she would reportedly call select paps right before moving. Kim Kardashian routinely tipped off the paps in her early days. Someone falling off the fame radar, like actors Denise Richards or Tori Spelling, will make arrangements for paps to come over and shoot them with their kids.\par \par \uc2 "Sometimes publicists tip off the paps without telling their clients," says Scott Cosman, owner of the photo agency FameFlynet. "They think their client needs the hit, but the star might think it's beneath them, so they just leak the information."\par \par \uc2 Sometimes it's about reframing the narrative. Before Angelina Jolie became a humanitarian, she was best known for wearing a vial of blood around her neck and kissing her brother. After she adopted seven-monthold Maddox from a Cambodian orphanage, Jolie carefully orchestrated a photoshoot with an approved pap that repositioned her image from troubled goth to responsible adult. After she started dating Brad Pitt, it was leaked to a photo agency that they would be taking their first big vacation at Kenya's Diani Beach, not exactly a pap hangout. (Now the couple are among the toughest celebs to snap, vacationing where paps can't get to without an AmEx black card and a helicopter.)\par \par \uc2 Many celebs simply like the cash. Lindsay Lohan has tipped off paps about her next stop in return for a gratuity. Ryan Reynolds is known to have an antagonistic relationship with the paparazzi, but recently he has been "captured" eating \uc2 Chobani yogurt\uc2 , carrying a \uc2 Burger King\uc2  bag, smiling at a \uc2 Nespresso\uc2  caf\u233\'00\'E9 and caressing a Can-Am motorcycle, all in apparently preplanned shots. Vlad isn't concerned with such philosophical matters. He's too busy waiting on Jenner and staring down the UK guy from earlier today. "I'd slit his throat! He keeps jumping s***."\par \par \uc2 In the fungible ethics of pap life, there's no point mentioning to Vlad that actually he's the one who jumped the Jenner shot. Soon, there are 20 to 25 paps outside the restaurant. They're all looking for the one shot that differentiates from what is charmingly known in the pap business as a gang bang.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Jenner's car pulls around back, and she sneaks out before anyone gets a clear shot. Vlad guns his car up Melrose a few blocks ahead of Jenner and the pursuing mob.\par \par \uc2 Vlad sees her in his rearview mirror and pulls in right behind her. He stays on Jenner's bumper until the car makes an abrupt right into the parking lot of a posh nail salon.\par \par \uc2 In a minute, a dozen cars bring 20 paps. But there's no shot, and she disappears inside. A horde of paps hems in a car driven by a Jenner fan who had followed them from the Urth Caff\u233\'00\'E9. He yells at them to move and not touch his car. No one listens. The driver hits the horn and pulls out a long knife - more like a mini-machete - from under his seat. He is just a kid. Vlad screams at him.\par \par \uc2 "What happened? Yeah! Pull it out! You ain't gonna do a single thing."\par \par \uc2 He's right; the kid puts the blade away and drives off. The other paps give Vlad space. He stalks back to his car. He says it's no big deal. "Get the f*** out here, you pull a humongous knife? I've had motherf***ers flash guns. He wasn't gonna do s***."\par \par \uc2 This all might sound creepy and gross, and it is. But there's a camaraderie and an adrenaline rush, a modern version of a gang of Dickensian pickpockets. Half the guys split, but the others dig in. They're not going to make any money - an exclusive shot of Jenner might make you a grand; a gang-bang shot with hair in her eyes might make you 100 bucks - but now it's a matter of principle.\par \par \uc2 Day turns to night. Finally, three hours later, Jenner emerges from the nail salon. She slinks out with a half-wave but with her hair still over her face. About a dozen paps have hung on, including Vlad. He gets an almost usable shot before she gets into the car. The camera flashes light the night and, for a moment, blind Jenner. She's disorientated and almost backs into a pole. A video pap named Malibu Rich yells at her.\par \par \uc2 "You're about to run over a kid on a bike!" There's no bike, no kid. The paps crack up. Jenner is impassive in the driver's seat. The Mercedes pulls away, and the paps head for home or night-time stakeouts of clubs and restaurants.\par \par \uc2 Vlad drives in silence. He passes graffiti spray-painted on the side of a gas station reading STOP MAKING DUMB PEOPLE FAMOUS. He doesn't notice.\par \par \uc2 It's a few days later, and Vlad has a tip from someone at LAX.\par \par \uc2 "The airport. Kim is back in town." Every generation gets the primo pap target they deserve, and America has gone from Jackie to Madonna to Britney to Kim Kardashian, queen of the reality world. It's a progression we really shouldn't dwell on. Kardashian is flying in from the Paris fashion shows on a Delta-\uc2 Air France\uc2 . Delta is problematic for celebrities.\par \par \uc2 An ex-pap showed me a sample of daily emails that TMZ acquires, listing all the stars flying on the airline. Vlad pulls into LAX, and it's a full gang bang, maybe 40 paps, but he's here because she's the most famous pap target of his career and he hopes that through some miracle he can get a special shot.\par \par \uc2 A few minutes later, someone screams. "Here she comes."\par \par \uc2 And there's Kardashian, all in black, except for a fur-lined tan coat. She's wearing big sunglasses. Paps are shouting questions.\par \par \uc2 "Kim, is Bruce going to have a sex change?" "Kim, is your family Shakespearean?" Vlad's face bobs above the sea of humanity, but he doesn't have a shot. So he peels off and runs out through the sliding doors and jumps up on a concrete barrier and shoots downward, ripping off 70 frames. In 30 seconds, it's over. Kim is stashed in a black SUV and is gone.\par \par \uc2 Vlad frantically scans his pictures. A giant smile breaks across his face, and he skips away, pirouetting in a crosswalk. It's the happiest I've ever seen him. He sits in the Mercedes and looks closer. The simultaneous flash of 50 cameras has lit Kardashian in an ethereal way. Today, she looks like a movie star. Vlad has a couple of killer shots of her from head to toe. He starts crowing.\par \par \uc2 "Got her, full frame! And the winner is... me! Trix are for kids! They always want to wolf-pack around her, so I got above them."\par \par \uc2 Vlad heads back towards Hollywood, still buzzing. We're stuck in traffic, but Vlad doesn't care. By the time he gets back, the Daily Mail will have a story up with all his pictures. He says he might make $10,000 once resales are factored in. This is unlikely - agencies will be flooded with gang-bang photos of Kim from LAX and will be happy to go with a slightly crappier photo to save some bucks. Later, once the adrenaline wears off, he admits he'll make only $1,000.\par \par \uc2 He drives in happy silence for a while before telling me another story. A few days ago, Vlad was trailing Kim's brother, Rob, in Beverly Hills. Rob is part of the collateral damage of the Kardashian story - Bruce Jenner's sanity is the other - putting on 50lb last year after breaking up with his girlfriend Rita Ora. According to the tabloids, his family is disgusted by his weight gain. For Vlad, he's still a good "get".\par \par \uc2 Eventually, Rob pulled over and Vlad approached his car. In a calm voice, Rob told Vlad he was trying to get his life together and wasn't even on the show this season.\par \par \uc2 "I just want to show your growth and how you're losing the weight," said Vlad.\par \par \uc2 But Rob politely said no again. Then Vlad did a very un-Vlad thing. He said OK, catching Rob by surprise. The pap and subject looked each other in the eye.\par \par \uc2 "Look, you guys have helped me achieve something I couldn't in a 9 to 5," Vlad said. "I would have never seen half the money I make now."\par \par \uc2 And then Vlad let him drive away. "Why did I do it? I don't want to be the bad guy."\par \par \uc2 Two months later, Vlad had his camera temporarily seized by Beverly Hill cops for taking unauthorised shots of Hilary Duff's kid at a playground. But right now, he jerks the Mercedes onto the hard shoulder and passes a dozen cars. He rolls down the windows and laughs loudly.\par \par \uc2 "F*** being the bad guy."\par \par \uc2 Paps are known by their nicknames - Bam-Bam, Zazy, Top Hat Rick and Mexican Vlad, not to be confused with Vlad the Black Russian\par \par \uc2 Vlad runs out and rips off 70 frames. In 30 seconds, it's over. Kim Kardashian is stashed in a black SUV and is gone\par \par \uc2 'Sometimes publicists tip off the paps.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The Tory leadership must stand up to Nigel Farage and persuade voters not to fall for his dangerous populism\par \par \uc2 By the knowing, this column will be laughed at for playing straight into the hands of my enemies. I realise that. I realise it pays them the ultimate compliment: it takes them seriously. I don't care. There are moments in life and in politics that are too important for tactics. Such a moment arrived for me this week when on to the doormat in the flats where I live in London's East End, dropped the UK Independence Party's election leaflet.\par \par \uc2 And, no, of course it isn't the first piece of idiotic political literature I've ever encountered: I've seen plenty in my time, including from my own party. And delivered it too.\par \par \uc2 And, no, it isn't the first time I've written about the wrongheadedness of Ukip's approach, or the danger it poses to Britain's centre-right. The reasoned case needs to be made again and again, and I'll keep trying.\par \par \uc2 And, no, this won't be my first or last column to berate the sly nastiness skulking beneath the covers of the party's pitch. The Ukip phenomenon provides in itself a case study for psychiatrists as well as politicians.\par \par \uc2 But it's the first time I have felt just a little bit frightened. This thing has a bad smell. I picked up that leaflet, read the lies and saw the menace.\par \par \uc2 As it happens, a young woman of Eastern European origin \u8212\'20\'14 always so pleasant and conscientious \u8212\'20\'14 who sweeps and cleans the entrance and staircase in the block, had arrived before I left. I wondered how the purple and yellow leaflets on the doormat would strike her, were she to look down.\par \par \uc2 Put yourself in her shoes. She's here legally, working legally, working hard, working for wages above the minimum that Parliament has laid down, in a job that any young British person is also free to take, and some do. On the doormat she reads purple-highlighted phrases from Nigel Farage's declaration: phrases such as: "4,000 people a week come to live in Britain from the EU ... the damage done to our national sovereignty, our pride and \u8212\'20\'14 dare I say it \u8212\'20\'14 our patriotism is immense ..." Finally: "Enough's enough".\par \par \uc2 How wouldyou feel? I think she might feel insulted: insulted and threatened \u8212\'20\'14 almost physically threatened \u8212\'20\'14 by the response this appeal had been carefully phrased to trigger. When a few hours later at an almost empty Derby railway station I passed a little posse of youths with purple badges and pound-sign stickers and (probably because of what I'd been thinking about their party) felt just momentarily menaced. My reaction was irrational. They were no more a "posse" than groups of Tory canvassers of which I've often enough been part. But I was starting to look at the Ukip phenomenon with new eyes. I've always known it was nasty, hypocritical nonsense but now, for the first time, I'm wondering whether it might catch on.\par \par \uc2 A word, first, about the nonsense.\par \par \uc2 There's nothing like reading an untruth about yourself for bringing its brazenness home with copperbottomed certainty. When I read (in a Ukip attack on this newspaper) that I was "privately educated" there was no need to fact-check the five government schools I remember attending before, at 15, being sent to a "private" non-apartheid school. And Mr Farage presumably does know that he himself went to a top public school, and does remember that he set up the Farage Family Educational Trust in an offshore tax haven \u8212\'20\'14 to confer (one supposes) similar privileges on future Farages.\par \par \uc2 Or take those "4,000 people a week" who "come to live in Britain" (says my leaflet). Or the "\u163\'00\'A355 million a day" that the EU "costs the UK". If I told Mr Farage that Britain gets \u163\'00\'A38 billion a year from Brussels, or that people are emigrating from the UK at the rate of 131,000 a year, would he call that honest? No, he'd expose furiously my removal from my sums of the amount we were paying in to the EU, and my omission to mention the number of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  coming in to this country. My claims would deserve to be called lies. So do his.\par \par \uc2 You may think my purpose here is to take the attack to Ukip. Only in passing. Anyone with a mind of his own can see what kind of people they are without any help from me. I expect nothing of Ukip's leadership and am not disappointed by them.\par \par \uc2 It's the leaders of my own party who disappoint me. Ukip are not a political party; not really. They're an unpleasant mutiny within the Conservative party. Having placed themselves outside the party they pose as an external foe; but they have many friends within it, willing them on.\par \par \uc2 My side in the Conservative party needs to take a stand too: vigorously, unapologetically, and soon. I'm ashamed that the cleaning woman on our East London staircase finds nobody among the Conservative leadership to speak up for her in public. I'm ashamed that Ukip's provocations litter doormats across Britain, without my own party countering the falsehoods or protesting at the hatefulness. I hear the Tory voices murmuring that the "strategy" is not to give these rascals the oxygen of publicity. I hear the nervy assurance that "this will blow over" if we keep our heads down and walk by on the other side.\par \par \uc2 I hear the warning that voters attracted by Ukip need our love, not our insults, and must not be branded as racists. I hear the knowing chuckle that columns such as this are music to Ukip's ears.\par \par \uc2 Stop these calculations, I say to self-respecting Tories, and fight. Let's have an end to "understanding" dangerous populists. Many racists are attracted to Ukip; many foreigner-hating feelings are inflamed by Ukip. Many with feelings of personal disappointment or inadequacy are sucked into the comfort of blaming someone Other, something from over the water.\par \par \uc2 It is not wrong to stigmatise the party that is doing this. It's not wrong to warn those voters that they would be idiots to fall for these hatemongers. Whatever is to come, nobody who today takes arms against this pernicious new force will be less admired one day for doing so.\par \par \uc2 I finish as I started: there comes a time when you recognise something as bad: simply, unambiguously bad. This is the moment to put aside your calculations, tear up the strategists' advice, decide which side you're on, and shout it loud.\par \par \uc2 There is a bad smell about Ukip and its hate-mongering leaflets\par \par \uc2 Many inadequate people blame their problems on foreigners\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140503ea530000t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 THE SIMON HEFFER COLUMN\b0\par\par\uc2 BY SIMON HEFFER   \par \uc2 1,439 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 41\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 HOW ED'S GETTING REDDER BY THE MINUTEA CEASELESS criticism of Ed Miliband is that he sometimes seems to be little more than a student union politician.And with his juvenile remarks this week that he wants to impose limits on increases in rents, he has shown once again that he values\u160\'00\'A0 a cheap headline over wise policy-making.For a man with a degree in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford, the Labour leader displays an alarming lack of knowledge of how economics works in a free society, and how wealth is created.He doesn't seem, for example, to have studied history and considered whether there might be a\u160\'00\'A0 link between the shortage of rental properties in London in the\u160\'00\'A0 Fifties and the rent controls that then operated.Nor does he seem to ask why, despite London then being full of bomb-sites, run-down housing and with building restrictions loosened, few developers were willing to step in.The answer is simple: it was not financially worth anyone, apart from such people as the \par \par \uc2 notorious\u160\'00\'A0 slum landlord Peter Rachman, renting out property.Mr Miliband also ignores two causes of the present housing crisis. One was the decision by the Labour government of which he was a member to allow unlimited \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from the EU, which created huge extra demand for accommodation.The other was \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 's economic policy that brought Britain to its knees\u160\'00\'A0 in 2008, and reduced the\u160\'00\'A0 funds available for investment in property.The fact is that building to let or to sell is a commercial risk, and few were prepared to take that risk during great economic uncertainty.By saying a Labour government would limit rent rises, landlords will inevitably switch their investments away from property \u8212\'20\'14 which will simply exacerbate the problem. Also, Mr Miliband's idea of restricting the fees paid to estate agents for lettings will either make them shed staff or find other ways of squeezing money out of home-buyers and sellers.Indeed, having already\u160\'00\'A0 promised to cap energy prices and seize land from house-builders, what we are witnessing is a return to the wretched days of Seventies statism. I jest, but perhaps, next, Mr Miliband might suggest food prices should be frozen \u8212\'20\'14 after all, most farmers vote Tory.Shamefully, he is fixated by the belief that the State has the answer to everything. Yet once Soviet-style distortions are imposed on the laws of supply and demand, the effect on wealth creation and growth are usually devastating.The sort of economy Mr Miliband seems to want \u8212\'20\'14 in which governments order restrictions on the price of any commodity that people find expensive \u8212\'20\'14 is one that is heading for ruin.If you want evidence of this, just look at what is happening in France. There, the Socialist President, \uc2 Francois Hollande\uc2  (who is much admired by Mr Miliband) is running a tightly regulated, high-tax-and-spend economy that is now in crisis and from which many companies are relocating abroad.One of Mr Miliband's\u160\'00\'A0 colleagues has told me that, if he becomes PM, the Labour leader wants to operate a 'socialist' government.The trouble is that history shows that, invariably, socialist governments do not improve living standards or make life easier for poorer people, because they drive away the wealth creators that provide employment, and who pay the taxes that fund welfare safety nets.Equally worrying, state\u160\'00\'A0 controls of rents and energy prices \u8212\'20\'14 and any other similar new wheeze \u8212\'20\'14 are a brilliant way to destroy whatever economic recovery the country is now enjoying.--TOUGH-GUY POSTURING\u160\'00\'A0 THAT'LL ONLY BACKFIRE No ONE would accuse me of being a bleeding heart liberal when it comes to crime. Indeed, I want criminals jailed \u8212\'20\'14 as a deterrent to others and to protect fellow citizens. However, I believe prison should do more than just deprive offenders of their liberty. Above all, inmates should be helped to prevent them re-offending on release. For example, since many prisoners are illiterate, they should be put on adult literacy programmes.That's also why I deplore the restrictions placed on books and musical instruments for prisoners. Of course, it's important to confine certain privileges to prisoners who have earned them by good conduct. But it's also vital, as part of the prison's civilising process, to allow inmates to play music. It undoubtedly gives them self-respect, which might dissuade them from further criminality.I fear Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has introduced these restrictions in a shameless bid to try to prove he's a Tory hard man. Instead, his lack of subtlety is merely helping ensure more of our criminals end up back inside.--I DON'T mind if U.S. drugs giant \uc2 Pfizer\uc2  buys its British rival \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2 . We thrive from living in a free market and Britain is the biggest foreign investor in the U.S. If we erect barriers to stop foreign firms bidding for our companies, then they will simply retaliate. The foreign currency from such a sale \u8212\'20\'14 an estimated $106?billion \u8212\'20\'14 would strengthen our economy. And if brilliant scientists at \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2  don't want to work for \uc2 Pfizer\uc2 , they can take their skills elsewhere, or set up their own firms. The \uc2 Pfizer\uc2  takeover bid is the price of success.--HOW chilling to hear Michael McConville, whose mother was abducted and murdered by the IRA in 1972, say that he knows the identity of her killers but is\u160\'00\'A0 too afraid, despite years of 'peace', to give the information to the police.\u160\'00\'A0 This is proof that sectarian violence still simmers beneath the surface in Ulster. If the police pursued Republican and Loyalist gangsters with half the zeal they target British soldiers suspected of crimes, the men of violence would have been rooted out long ago.--PERFECT TICKET FOR GEORGEIt's rumoured \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  aspires to be Foreign Secretary after the next election. This is a trifle presumptuous, as the Tories have to win it first. If they don't, the ex-Chancellor is likely to be engaged in a bloody battle with Boris Johnson to succeed David Cameron.I don't share the growing acclaim for Mr Osborne. He could have expedited our recovery by cutting expenditure faster and further, and slashing taxes, too. I also fear the 'recovery' will wobble badly when interest rates go up. If he really wants to go to the FO, Dave should send him there now.--NIGEL FARAGE was right not to stand in the Newark by-election. His priority is to secure his party the best outcome in the euro elections. His enemies mock him for cowardice, but it seems that \u8212\'20\'14 as with daily accusations that Ukip is full of people who would have flourished in 1930s Germany \u8212\'20\'14 the more the other parties try to vilify Ukip, the higher it rises in the polls. ==A YEAR ago, I wrote of Tory-controlled \uc2 Essex County Council\uc2 's promise to pursue\u160\'00\'A0 its former leader, the convicted fraudster Lord Hanningfield, for more than \u163\'00\'A3250,000 that he improperly spent when\u160\'00\'A0 in charge. It hasn't got very far.This week, the council said it is 'still exploring all avenues of recovering monies due to the Council from Lord Hanningfield in the most cost-effective way'. Why aren't bailiffs now being sent into Hanningfield Towers in the same way they pounce on taxpayers who owe the council money?--SINCE Boris Johnson is\u160\'00\'A0 incapable, so far, of stopping next week's four-day London Tube strike \u8212\'20\'14 which will cause huge inconvenience to millions and damage the country's\u160\'00\'A0 economy \u8212\'20\'14 how good would he be at running the country? His predecessor, Ken Livingstone, says a photo he saw of\u160\'00\'A0 Mr Johnson's desk showed its contents unmoved from his own time five years ago. He also accuses Mr Johnson of often working from home and leaving the serious business of governing to a team of deputies.The misguided Tory constituency parties allegedly queueing up to select Mr Johnson as their parliamentary candidate should take note.--CABLE'S BAD FOR BUSINESSThe controversy over the ludicrously cheap share price set for the \uc2 Royal Mail\uc2  when it was privatised\u160\'00\'A0 has centred upon the\u160\'00\'A0 inadequacy of Vince Cable, who led the sell-off. This is simply confirmation that the Lib Dem grandee has achieved nothing as Business Secretary. He has failed to stop small businesses being strangled by red tape and his attempts to manipulate university access by social engineering will be disastrous for our country. With a Cabinet reshuffle due, isn't it time this old fraud was moved on?\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140502ea530000p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 PLATELL'S PEOPLE\b0\par\par\uc2 BY AMANDA PLATELL   \par \uc2 1,429 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Cancel the confetti. Put away the bunting. Cressida and Harry have broken it off, crushing mounting hopes of another Royal Wedding. Some speculated it was because Cressie was too needy. Others said the couple rowed over money. But friends say that overshadowing it all was Harry's first love, Chelsy Davy, whose own flourishing new relationship made him uneasy about his feelings.Me? I reckon it wasn't Chelsy who was the spectre at the royal romantic feast, but Kate. Surely it's no coincidence that the split came so soon after two weeks of wall-to-wall coverage of Kate, William and baby George's tour of Australia and New Zealand.Kate did a fine job Down Under \u8212\'20\'14 the perma-smile, the knee-length middle-aged frocks, the perfectly tousled hair and Dynasty make-up. And, of course, the bonny baby on her hip.Here was the modern-day royal wife at work \u8212\'20\'14 as perfect as a \uc2 Disney\uc2  princess, and, dare I say it, as bland.\par \par \uc2  For Cressie it must have offered a terrifying vision of her future.It's not simply that, as Harry's wife, she would for ever be compared to Kate. Who was the more fashionable, the more dutiful, the better mother?It's that she could see from Kate's example that the 'fairytale' royal existence is anything but. Indeed, for any normal young woman, with her own identity and aspirations, royal life must seem stultifying.Certainly, it would be hard to find two girls more different than Cressie and Kate. From the moment the then Miss Middleton met Prince William at university, all she ever wanted was to be his wife \u8212\'20\'14 encouraged onwards by her socially ambitious mother, Carole. Kate never held down a proper full-time job; never lived anywhere except in her parents' homes; never sought financial or emotional independence. Cressie, on the other hand, left dance college and immediately got a \u163\'00\'A320,000 job with a theatre marketing company in Soho to be self-sufficient. She moved into a modest flat in Shepherd's Bush, which she rents with a friend. And she still harbours dreams of dancing professionally \u8212\'20\'14 dreams that would have become impossible if she'd married into the Firm. Not for Cressie a life of walking two steps behind her Prince, fawning over his every word, traipsing around cutting ribbons and shaking hands with strangers. She's far more at home in old jeans and a pair of Converse trainers than in Alexander McQueen couture and L.?K. Bennett heels.No, far from being too needy for Harry, I suspect Cressie wasn't nearly needy enough. And frankly, what modern woman could blame her?--* The three parties' response to Ukip's lead in the European elections is to brand its supporters racist. When will they understand that decent hard-working Brits are legitimately concerned about the uncontrolled numbers of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who take their jobs, fill their schools with non-English speaking children, lengthen waiting times on the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and claim benefits having never put a penny into the system? They're not racists but realists.* A poll says people think Nick Clegg is not only the most handsome party leader, but also the most likely to be a good cook. Cleggy in a pinny stirring the mung beans? Sorry, it's not an image that sets my heart racing.* The man who threw an egg at Nigel Farage has been arrested on suspicion of assault. Yet none of the care workers who slapped, abused and humiliated their elderly patients at the Old Deanery care home have been charged. Surely hitting an old woman with dementia is a far greater crime than egging a pompous politician.--Sporting a strange new hairstyle apparently resulting from a second hair transplant, Gordon Ramsay was said to be copying a look favoured by his pal David Beckham. Really? Looked far more like Ricky Gervais's TV character Derek to me \u8212\'20\'14 an unattractive halfwit with little grasp of reality, who's got audiences switching off in droves. Yup, that's Gordon.--A SMALL COMFORT FOR PEACHES' BOYSLike most people hooked on drugs, Peaches Geldof was a master of concealment. On the surface, and no doubt in her troubled heart, she was a devoted mother and wife. Even her obsession with 'attachment parenting', which often led to periods of time away from her husband, may have been part of her camouflage.Apparently, no one close to her knew she was visiting a rehab clinic in the weeks before her death to collect methadone, which helps users get off heroin.Tragic though her death was for all those who loved her, and especially her two young sons, I hope they will take some comfort from knowing that to the very end, this adoring mother was trying to get clean. For them.--After the shock announcement that Paxo's leaving Newsnight, the bookies are speculating as to who will be his replacement.Please let it be Radio 4's PM presenter Eddie Mair. If they give the top job to Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis or Laura Kuenssberg, expect Newslight not Newsnight \u8212\'20\'14 and a stampede of the few loyal viewers it has left.--Johnny Depp speaks warmly of his former partner of 14 years, Vanessa Paradis, whom he dumped for the bisexual 28-year-old actress Amber Heard (no, sorry, we haven't). 'I love her and she loves me, and she's a great mummy,' says Depp. For which, read: 'She takes care of the kids while I go off and wallow in my midlife crisis.'--VICTIMS HAVE A LIFE SENTENCEAmong the thousands of tributes to devoted teacher Ann Maguire was one from Frances Lawrence, whose husband Philip was killed 18 years ago trying to protect a pupil from a knife gang.'By now perhaps I should have learnt words of comfort for you,' she wrote, 'but I have learnt only that there are no words. I send all my love and my prayers on the cruel journey that you are forced to begin.'And nothing could be more cruel than to learn, as Mrs Lawrence did this week, that the man who murdered her husband will be free in days, despite being jailed 'indefinitely' for the killing. The only life sentences served now are by the loved ones of the victims.--* Heston Blumenthal's Dinner has been named one of the top 10 restaurants in the world, despite having to close earlier this year due to an outbreak of a vomiting bug. If this is the best, I dread to think what goes on in the worst.--HUHNE GOT OFF LIGHTLYHow can it be fair that Constance Briscoe, the female judge who aided and abetted Vicky Pryce in her vendetta against her husband Chris Huhne, was given a 16-month jail sentence \u8212\'20\'14 twice what either of the main culprits got. All three of them lied. All three were in contempt of court. And all three betrayed their positions of authority in a bid to protect themsleves. Yet Briscoe got far harsher treatement. Still, I expect all is not lost for her. If Huhne's experience is anything to go by, she'll walk straight out of jail into a job as a columnist for The Guardian.--Despair as George Clooney finally settles down with his high-flying human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin \u8212\'20\'14 and surprise, too. There was silly me thinking he was holding out for a Dorothy!--CLIFFORD'S OTHER BETRAYALAs Max Clifford contemplates his eight-year jail sentence, we should spare a thought for the two other women he so brutally betrayed \u8212\'20\'14 his first wife and daughter.The PR guru admitted in court to being serially unfaithful to his wife of 33 years, Elizabeth, who died in 2003. His idyllic family life provided the sexual predator with the perfect cover.But even more loathsome was the way he used his disabled daughter, Louise, now 42, to foster the impression he was a devoted father who worked tirelessly for charities that helped those like her. Despicable.--Jeremy Clarkson is in hot water over using the N-word (or not) \u8212\'20\'14 just the latest in a long line of gaffes from a man who used to be the nation's most treasured 'blokes' bloke'.\u160\'00\'A0 Surely it's no coincidence that since he's started spending less time with his clever and calm wife Frances and rather more with a younger blonde assistant, his ego has expanded even faster than his waistline. Go home Jeremy, and grow up.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140502ea530000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

JUST ONE SMALL PROBLEM, SAYS MAX HASTINGS. IT'S . . .\b0\par\par\uc2 BY MAX HASTINGS   \par \uc2 1,957 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Economists tend to be grey suits who work better than pills if you need a cure for insomnia. But now a new kid on the block has shot to the top of the Amazon bestseller lists in Britain and the United States, who boasts eyelash-fluttering looks, and has been dubbed by New York magazine 'the rock star economist'.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Piketty, only 42, is the author of a tome entitled Capital In The 21st Century, which is heavy enough to create a doll's house rug if dropped on the children's hamster. Admirers say it is a tract for our times, laying bare the wickedness of the way the Western world manages and distributes its money. Since its author quotes authors such as Balzac and Jane Austen a lot, he gains reward points as a supposedly literate sort of chap.\par \par \uc2 This, then, is the book everyone who likes to think they're switched on to the zeitgeist is talking about, from Los Angeles to London.\par \par \uc2 The Guardian treats Piketty's work with the sort of reverence it usually reserves for Tony Benn's diaries and the collected works of Polly Toynbee. The author, writes Paul Mason in its pages, 'has placed an unexploded bomb within mainstream, classical economics'. The paper also gave space this week to that darling of the Left, Unite's boss Len McCluskey, to offer the book a personal endorsement as 'manna from heaven for somebody like me'.\par \par \uc2 The theme of Piketty's book is that social and economic inequality in Western societies is soaring; that merely tinkering with this scandal by improving education and raising taxes a percentage point or two will not cure the disease. His own remedy is Draconian, even by Ed Balls's standards: restore confiscatory taxation 'on incomes deemed to be indecent (and economically useless)'.\par \par \uc2 He urges that income taxes should be increased to 80pc on earnings in excess of either \u163\'00\'A3300,000 or \u163\'00\'A3500,000 a year \u8212\'20\'14 whichever number appeals to a government. More controversial still, he calls for a global wealth tax, imposed at the rate of 1 per cent a year on fortunes of \u163\'00\'A3600,000 to \u163\'00\'A33 million, up to as much as 10 per cent for those earning more than a billion.\par \par \uc2 Piketty has dug out of the ideological graveyard ideas we thought that Thatcherism had discredited 30 years ago, and which trample with hob-nailed boots upon every conviction and aspiration of the middle classes in Britain and around the world.\par \par \uc2 If governments adopted his proposed policies, forget about the pain they might or might not impose upon the rich: they would spell doom for the hopes of millions of ordinary families to save for the future through sheer hard work, to accumulate very modest wealth, and to pass on some money to the next generation.\par \par \uc2 This book is an attack on capitalism. And yet does not capitalism provide a structure which encourages personal aspiration, the desire to enrich oneself through graft, and the opportunity to keep as much of the money you have earned as possible? It is a simple philosophy which will ring true with most readers of this newspaper.\par \par \uc2 Even though Piketty is advancing propositions not seriously discussed anywhere in the world, even in communist states, since the demise of Chairman Mao, his thesis has been respectfully received by numerous commentators in the U.S. and Britain, including several whom one would expect to know better.\par \par \uc2 The book's success \u8212\'20\'14 not only among the chattering classes, but also among those who write the manifestos for socialist parties in Europe, Britain's Labour Party prominent among them \u8212\'20\'14 tells us that the Left has still not given up on its tawdry old belief that governments know better how to spend most of our money than we do.\par \par \uc2 The lunatic Left did not die with Tony Benn and Michael Foot. It is still out there, gazing hungrily at the earnings and bank accounts of the striving middle classes, those who have no hope of establishing offshore trusts or fleeing to Switzerland to escape its claws.\par \par \uc2 Piketty's CV shows clearly enough where he is coming from. He has taught for years at the Paris Institute of Economics, from which he resigned for a time to become an adviser to Segolene Royal, former partner and now ministerial colleague of President \uc2 Francois Hollande\uc2 , France's most disastrous leader since King Louis XVI left for the guillotine.\par \par \uc2 We may assume that Piketty, as a close chum of his country's top socialists, encouraged Hollande in his brilliant stroke of attempting to introduce a top tax rate of 75 per cent, and other policies which have caused flocks of rich French folk to buy one-way Eurostar tickets to London.\par \par \uc2 I would not encourage you to read Piketty's 700-page book \u8212\'20\'14 as I did this week \u8212\'20\'14 unless you are easily excited by such equations as 'r'>g', which apparently means that the return on capital is greater than economic growth. But he is right at least in arguing that rising inequality poses political and economic problems which most governments recognise as both serious and intractable.\par \par \uc2 The author is especially repelled by inherited wealth \u8212\'20\'14 the spectacle of the children of the rich waxing fat on cash they have not earned: 'In stagnant societies, wealth accumulated in the past naturally takes on considerable importance . . . When the rate of return on capital significantly exceeds the growth rate of the economy, it logically follows that inherited wealth grows faster than output and income.'\par \par \uc2 Piketty notes that, in getting a return on savings and investments, the dice are heavily loaded in favour of the rich, because they can employ smarter financial advisers. Even rich universities and foundations profit from this: Harvard can afford to pay its investment managers \u163\'00\'A360 million a year, because its endowment fund is worth \u163\'00\'A320 billion. Many of the most lucrative investments have a high entry threshold which excludes ordinary small savers.\par \par \uc2 On this point at least, he is supported by an OECD report this week which suggests that in the past 30 years, the share of national income the top 1 per cent richest Americans take in has more than doubled. The story is similar here in Britain.\par \par \uc2 He asserts the importance of creating a level playing field for both corporate and personal taxes, so that neither companies nor individuals can shelter their wealth from governments who follow his high-taxation prescription.\par \par \uc2 He is committed to European political union, without which 'it is highly likely that tax competition will continue to wreak havoc'. He speaks warmly of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from poor countries to rich ones, as a means of 'ensuring that the economic benefits of globalisation are shared by everyone'. In other words, every Somali drawing benefits in London, or Moroccan comfortably ensconced in Paris, represents a fraction of the just retribution for past imperial pillaging.\par \par \uc2 Now, most of us reading the above would laugh heartily and suggest that Monsieur Piketty would be happiest living in Cuba, or serving as economics correspondent of Channel 4 News. But it is sobering to consider that France already has a government which thinks its sexy author guru is dead right.\par \par \uc2 It is hard to doubt that Ed Miliband is privately of the same opinion, whatever he does or does not dare to say publicly before next year's General Election. Most of what Piketty writes about the iniquities of capitalism will have Miliband \u8212\'20\'14 who wants to bring back socialism \u8212\'20\'14 muttering 'hear, hear' as he turns the pages.\par \par \uc2 Only this week, Labour's leader pledged a return to the Neolithic policy of statutory rent controls for tenants. He makes no secret of his belief in higher taxation \u8212\'20\'14 he is committed to returning the top rate to 50 per cent \u8212\'20\'14 and in swingeing inheritance taxes. The latter in particular are especially punitive now that so many more ordinary people in Britain are being dragged into the net.\par \par \uc2 Once, inheritance taxes were the bane only of the rich, but with the \u163\'00\'A3325,000 threshold frozen since 2009 while house prices rocket, ever more families face losing a small fortune to the greedy arms of the Treasury. Yes, some of the ills Piketty identifies are absolutely real. It is a scandal that corporate chief executives, and for that matter bankers, are paid grotesque sums of money, heedless of their abilities and even when they fail.\par \par \uc2 Global businesses must be made to pay taxes in the countries in which they reap profits. It is depressing that the super-rich forfeit a far lower proportion of their incomes in tax than you and I do. But the notion that the appropriate remedy for any or all of these problems is confiscatory taxation \u8212\'20\'14 theft by the state \u8212\'20\'14 is beyond barking, or rather, discredited years ago.\par \par \uc2 One of the foremost lessons of the 20th century is that governments are rotten judges of how best to safeguard and spend our money. Capitalism is a flawed system, but in our lifetimes we have seen socialism \u8212\'20\'14 and communism \u8212\'20\'14 in action, and they have failed abysmally, in France as in Britain as in Cuba as in Russia.\par \par \uc2 Piketty hates privatisations of state-owned industries. But he should have noticed that privatisations make utilities vastly more efficient, and generally allow ordinary people to share in the wealth that comes with successful private enterprise. The huge loss-making \uc2 Air France\uc2 , to name but one surviving drain on France's exchequer, is hardly an advertisement for public ownership.\par \par \uc2 The author calls for much increased investment in education and training. This is sensible enough, because it is the only effective means of lifting the children of the underclass out of poverty.\par \par \uc2 But he says nothing of the role of the Left in crippling many state education systems. In his obsession with punishing the 'haves', he casually dismisses the vital role of reward and low taxation \u8212\'20\'14 in which we should include inheritance levies \u8212\'20\'14 as drivers of achievement.\par \par \uc2 The vast middle class, to which most of us now belong, inhabit a world of dreams, foremost among which is an aspiration to accumulate a little money \u8212\'20\'14 or even, if we work hard and get lucky \u8212\'20\'14 a lot of money, some of which we can pass on to our children.\par \par \uc2 Piketty treats returns on investment as a form of unearned rewards for the undeserving. But I think instead \u8212\'20\'14 as maybe you do, too \u8212\'20\'14 of the injustice that after investing my savings from taxed income, we are taxed a second time on everything that money produces.\par \par \uc2 In his fixation with the super-rich, spoilt darlings like the daughters of Bernie Ecclestone, or the human crocodiles who direct the world's investment banks, Piketty forgets the tens of millions of middle-class people who operate and live by a capitalist system which remains the least bad mankind has yet devised.\par \par \uc2 The man is an ass, of course, or rather a 19th-century Marxist utopian. It is hardly surprising that France's President Hollande is drowning politically after pursuing some of the author's recipes. What should worry us more is the chorus of praise heaped on Piketty's book by the Left here in Britain, who talk as if he had found the philosopher's stone.\par \par \uc2 Should Ed Miliband make it to Downing Street next year, some version of the author's crazy ideas for reforming capitalism is likely to be road-tested on the British people, and we shall be front-seat passengers for the inevitable crash.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140502ea530000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw142\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2130\pichgoal600

GRAHAM YOUNG reports\par \par \uc2 THE INCREASING prevalence of reports citing the North-South divide become so commonplace they really began to annoy Robert Shore. What about the third of the country that was being passed over just as much as the proverbial piggy in the middle, he wondered? To those of us who live here, Birmingham is the country's second largest city at the heart of a super region that has given the world so much.\par \par \uc2 Except, as we all know, it doesn't get anything like as much credit back in return.\par \par \uc2 Places like Birmingham and the Black Country, of which Robert is fond.\par \par \uc2 And Mansfield, the mining town of his birth, which most people know only because it has a football team.\par \par \uc2 To try to set the record straight, to fly the flag and to galvanise opinion, all at the same time, Robert set off on his travels and put pen to paper.\par \par \uc2 The result is a new book called Bang In The Middle, a bright-and-breezy read which salutes the contributions of everyone from pop star Robbie Williams to lexicographer Dr Johnson and Britain's first woman prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.\par \par \uc2 It also recognises how everything from the Industrial Revolution to the theory of evolution all have their deepest roots here in the Midlands.\par \par \uc2 'does Robert's first visit to Birmingham was for a completely different reason - to see US rockers Metallica on their third album Masters of Puppets tour at the New Street Odeon in 1986.\par \par \uc2 would been Today, he admires the city's energy and its can-do "Forward" attitude.\par \par \uc2 But he is also acutely aware that it deserves a better reputation around the country.\par \par \uc2 seeing just To that end, he believes Birmingham should begin to boast about its musical legacy.\par \par \uc2 And be willing to accept that it can no longer stand on its own two feet if it's to get noticed.\par \par \uc2 Robert, now a Londonbased arts journalist who edits a quarterly publication called Elephant Magazine, believes there's a case for publicity in numbers.\par \par \uc2 "As a visitor, I was surprised how exciting Birmingham felt," he says.\par \par \uc2 "There are lots of squares and they keep sticking bits on, one on top of another. It feels dynamic.\par \par \uc2 "But Manchester has been a lot cleverer with its musical legacy, sticking lots of posters up saying 'this is where that happened.'" ."\par \par \uc2 If the Midlands is so overlooked, why are there so many \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  here from all corners of the world - how do they find us? "That's a paradox," he admits. "There are so many big, former industrial cities in the region and Birmingham is a tremendous melting pot."\par \par \uc2 The idea for the book began when Robert's five-year-old son Hector began to ask where, why and when questions.\par \par \uc2 But while he saw the anonymity '' Dad realised that selling his wife's origins in the positivelyviewed Paris was quicker than trying to explain his own background in the Midlands.\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Clarkson the Midlands' have of the Midlands as a personal challenge, there was another conundrum to be solved - finding a publisher willing to take a punt.\par \par \uc2 of national interest, but as it's me...\par \par \uc2 "'Jeremy Clarkson does the Midlands' would have been of national interest, but seeing as it's just me...\par \par \uc2 "I was lucky that (publishers) The Friday Project were interested in it immediately."\par \par \uc2 A fun list of 50 Great Things to Come Out of the Midlands is included at the end.\par \par \uc2 But in order to understand some of Robert's more left-field choices - Bob Dylan and The Sistine Chapel - readers are directed towards the explanations to be found in a free online ebook after the publishers decided that Bang in the Middle would have become too long had they been included in print.\par \par \uc2 A very personal choice by Robert sees Mr Darcy at No 1, but, especially considering he's an east Midlands' man, the next three things are very Birmingham - hobbits (2), Tony Hancock (3) and the balti (4).\par \par \uc2 It's at this point that Robert has a confession to make.\par \par \uc2 "In absolute terms, a lot of the list is, and should have been, about Birmingham," he says.\par \par \uc2 "But I was worried the book could easy have been dominated by the city, so you'll find the chapter about Melton Mowbray is just as long.\par \par \uc2 "And the funny thing about writing so much about Melton Mowbray is how seriously the people there have taken it, when it's meant to be just a bit of fun."\par \par \uc2 There's another interesting choice at No 51 on the ebook - Phil Lynott, the late Thin Lizzy star.\par \par \uc2 And that's because although his favourite rocker was universally seen as Irish, Lynott was actually born in West Bromwich just like Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant.\par \par \uc2 "Lynott was my favourite," says Robert. "When he died (aged just 36 in 1986) I couldn't listen to his music for a long time."\par \par \uc2 Other subjects which fascinate him include Midlands' humour and accents.\par \par \uc2 "It's a very distinctive, self-deprecating humour," says Robert.\par \par \uc2 "It's the best of English humour and people are very attracted to that.\par \par \uc2 "We could do with a very popular soap opera - we have The Archers, but that's too rural.\par \par \uc2 "As for the 'accent',' if it was a northern one, then people would love it and it would have a much better reputation.\par \par \uc2 "Birmingham needs to make itself part of a big block of the country.\par \par \uc2 "I think there was a time in the 1970s when government felt Birmingham was getting too big for its boots and kept things away.\par \par \uc2 "On the M1, there are only two signs which say 'Midlands.' .\par \par \uc2 "But when you put all of the (Midlands towns and cities) together you get a different idea about this part of the country."\par \par \uc2 One other thing which fascinates Robert is how people will claim to know something about Birmingham, but not about other places nearby.\par \par \uc2 "People will have no idea about Leicester," he says.\par \par \uc2 "So, in that respect, it's good to get some cliches in circulation in order to be identified in national culture.\par \par \uc2 "At least, then, you can say you are not like that."\par \par \uc2 Bang in the Middle by Robert Shore is out now.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Features | = THE MAN WHO PAYS HIS WAY =\par \par \uc2 Ajourney home begins with a single nudge, backwards. As the tug pushes the aircraft away from the gate, you feel a gentle bump. And relax: the airport stress is behind you. The tug uncouples, the engines surge and the plane moves forward.\par \par \uc2 Or not, in the case of \uc2 British Airways\uc2  Flight 2038 from Orlando to Gatwick on Tuesday night. What BA describes as a "minor technical issue", could not be fixed as quickly as hoped. After four hours on the ground the flight crew could not complete the journey within the stipulated time limit. Shortly after midnight, passengers were offloaded and bussed to hotels in the \uc2 Walt Disney\uc2  World area. They had been due back on Wednesday morning in the United Kingdom, but instead woke up in the Magic Kingdom and finally touched down in Sussex on Thursday afternoon.\par \par \uc2 In fact, they were extremely lucky, and had a better Mickey Mouse experience than those whose flights made it back on schedule on Wednesday - particularly the 150,000 who flew into London's airports. At the leading gateway, Heathrow, the Underground strike was compounded by separate industrial action which led to more than half the Express Rail Link trains being cancelled. Welcome to Britain.\par \par \uc2 Worse was to come. Had BA been able to fix that problem just before the pilots went "out of hours", the flight would have landed at Gatwick on Wednesday afternoon, leaving passengers at the end of a queue longer than the line for \uc2 Disney\uc2 's Mission: Space.\par \par \uc2 An unspecified IT fault meant that passport readers and "e-gates" stopped working. Manual processing led to "longer queues for some passengers" according to the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  and Security minister, James Brokenshire. For passengers at Gatwick, Heathrow and many other airports, that translated as "mayhem". As airport rage rippled through the queues and scuffles reportedly broke out at Luton and Gatwick, Mr Brokenshire insisted: "Security must remain our priority at all times." What he meant was: the illusion of security must be maintained at all costs.\par \par \uc2 QUEUE TIPS Despite our weather and unreliable transport, Britain is attractive to villains - from human-traffickers to terrorists - and the UK's frontiers, like those of every other nation, are leaky. So officials plod dutifully on, manually entering the passport details of returning holidaymakers who they know pose no threat and are merely tired, grumpy and keen to get home.\par \par \uc2 Talking of which: while queuejumping is never to be condoned, on Monday night my \uc2 Ryanair\uc2  flight touched down at Stansted behind schedule and we all found ourselves in the last dismal wave of arrivals at the end of the passport queue. So I hopped over a barrier to join a much shorter queue to my left - the queue for non-Europeans, as it turned out.\par \par \uc2 If you have never joined this thirdclass queue (after flight crew, first, and Europeans, second), here's how it goes. Ahead stands a row of desks with officers deciding if each traveller has the right to proceed. Behind them, Border Force officials scan the queue; profiling passengers using their eyes, training and experience to assess those whose behaviour suggests they require closer investigation.\par \par \uc2 Conversely, most travellers deserve to be investigated less closely. That was the purpose of the UK's "Smart-Zone" trials in 2011. The Advance Passenger Information (API) that we must all submit was scrutinised while the plane was in the air. Some shortand long-haul flights with a high proportion of British passengers were given the lightest of touches: an officer looked at a passenger and their passport photo, and waved them through - just like the olden days. The average time to process a European flight fell from 18 minutes to eight, freeing Border Force staff to focus on real risks. "Our intention," said the man behind it, Brodie Clark, "is to help low-threat people through quickly, safely and comfortably. Those who do intend harm are sifted out."\par \par \uc2 NO END OF THE LINE Soon afterwards, Mr Clark resigned as UK Border Force chief after an almighty row with the Home Secretary over the tactical relaxation of controls.\par \par \uc2 Since then, Border Force officers have had to revert to a box-ticking culture that does no favours to travellers returning to, or visiting, Britain. Standing in absurdly long lines is, it seems, the price we must pay for the freedom to explore the world.\par \par \uc2 Document IIND000020140503ea530003u\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par
