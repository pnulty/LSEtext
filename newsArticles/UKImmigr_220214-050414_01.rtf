\par\par \uc2 Guardian Comment and Debate Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: This is the choice we offer the hungry: dignity or food: There has been shock, and denial, about the rise of foodbanks in Britain. But they cannot cope with a national crisis\b0\par\par\uc2 Jonathan Freedland   \par \uc2 1,157 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 33\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 When people used to speak of hunger - as an issue, not a sensation - they used to speak of faraway. Hunger meant the developing world, NGOs, imploring eyes on the TV news. It was, in modern times at least, a distant problem. So it comes as a shock that in the second decade of the 21st century we are speaking about hunger in Britain, right here right now.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps we were reassured by the notion that we live in the age of "relative poverty", when those who were officially deemed poor just had less than everyone else. The poor of our era were, we imagined, not Charles Dickens poor. They still had food on the table and a roof over their heads. Some of them even had the odd plasma TV, or so we read in the papers.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps that is why there has been something of a delayed reaction to the rise and rise of genuine hunger in this country. The unkind would call it denial. But it is becoming harder to deny.\par \par \uc2 This week the nation's most senior clerics told of what they are seeing every day, in the parishes where they and their colleagues live and work. Vincent Nichols, the newly elevated Catholic cardinal, branded the welfare system "a disgrace", while 27 Anglican bishops and 16 other Christian leaders blamed the government's benefits changes for a "national crisis" of hunger.\par \par \uc2 I visited a foodbank this week, in Hackney in east London, a three-minute walk from a pleasant green complete with upmarket cafes and an Italian deli. It is a sight at once heartening and shaming. Heartening because it is good to see that, for all the talk of alienation and atomisation, for all David Cameron's one-time insistence that we live in "broken Britain", people are still willing to give up time, money and effort to care with great sensitivity and respect for those they have never met. Shaming because, as Cameron admitted when the subject was flood relief, "we are a wealthy country", and in a wealthy country people should not go hungry.\par \par \uc2 The pity of it is inescapable. I saw a man take home a couple of carrier bags filled with the most basic kind of basics: tinned sausages, a can of soup, a packet of pasta. All decent enough, each allocation calculated for balance by nutritionists.\par \par \uc2 Except you and I would not want to live on that for three days, which is how long it has to last. And the rules of the Trussell Trust, which operates more than 400 foodbanks, say that he can only get such help twice more. After that, he will be on his own.\par \par \uc2 The government's reply to the clerics is that they're on a moral mission to wean people off "welfare dependency" and that, in the prime minister's words, it "is wrong to penalise those who work hard and do the right thing while rewarding those who can work, but don't". It is worth unpacking each element of that.\par \par \uc2 Cameron's statement rests on the repeatedly implied assumption that the only people going hungry are those who have opted for idleness as a lifestyle choice, who could work but don't fancy it. This assumption is false. The majority of poor households include at least one person who works. As Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, put it this week: "People who are using food banks are not scroungers who are cynically trying to work the system. They are drawn from the 6 million working poor in this country, people who are struggling to make ends meet in low paid or bitty employment." Sure enough, the very first thing the "clients" I speak to at the Hackney foodbank tell me - unprompted - is how desperate they are to work. One is an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  legally barred from working. The other is a former removal man now aged 60 who can't afford to buy the van he needs to get started again.\par \par \uc2 Yet the rhetoric behind the government's welfare policy focuses narrowly on those dishonestly claiming benefits, even though such fraud accounts for less than 1% of the money paid out. To punish that tiny, parasitical minority, hundreds of thousands of people - poor not because they're lazy but because of low wages, patchy, zero-hours jobs or rising food costs - are going hungry.\par \par \uc2 As for welfare dependency, on that logic any and all support is part of the problem: the minute you help someone, you risk making them dependent. The bishop of Bradford is surely right to argue that the government might as well "say . . . we are prepared for people to starve and become destitute in order to achieve that longer-term goal" of ending welfare dependency. Like refusing to put out fires lest you encourage fire brigade dependency, it would at least have the merit of consistency.\par \par \uc2 The subtler argument from the right is the one that celebrates the foodbanks' admirable embodiment of communal self-help. Surely the church should be happy that neighbours, not some faceless state bureaucracy, are helping the hungry? Nice in theory, until you see the extreme pressure foodbanks are under, the days they run out of food, the fact that affluent areas often, and predictably, get more donations than the poor areas that need most. That's the trouble with a voluntary system, designed to give emergency help only: it cannot cope with what is a nationwide crisis.\par \par \uc2 The benign, big society view also fails to reckon with shame. I spoke to a Glasgow volunteer who told me she knows of men too proud to use their local foodbank, who instead walk miles out of their way so they can get food for their families without being seen by their neighbours. They cannot afford the bus, and the walk home carrying bags of tins is hard, but it preserves at least some dignity. I learned too of the single mothers who fear visiting a foodbank, thereby admitting they cannot feed their children, lest they be deemed incapable and their kids taken into care.\par \par \uc2 This was why Britons sought to put the Victorian era of charity behind us, why we decided that sometimes a state service is better: because there is less shame in claiming a nationally mandated benefit than in going to a church hall, being handed a food parcel and having to nod and say thank you.\par \par \uc2 Still, the shame is bearable if the alternative is you or your family going hungry. What has become of us, when that is the choice we offer our fellow citizens: dignity or food? And this in our wealthy, wealthy country.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @Freedland\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140221ea2m00063\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Review Pages\par \b \uc2 Review: NON-FICTION: 'My mother has cut a hole in my underwear': Gary Shteyngart's memoir is his funniest and saddest book so far, writes \uc2 J Robert Lennon\uc2 : Little Failure by Gary Shteyngart (368pp, \uc2 Hamish Hamilton\uc2 , pounds 16.99)\b0\par\par\uc2 J Robert Lennon   \par \uc2 1,300 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It would be easy to dismiss Gary Shteyngart's new book, Little Failure, by asking if the world really needs a memoir from someone whose early fiction was so clearly drawn from its author's own life. A Russian Jewish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , a sample summary might read, unlucky in love but rich in self-deprecating humour, grapples with familial angst and sexual obsession while observing the comedic fallout from the clash between cultures. This could describe any of Shteyngart's works, including this one. The author acknowledges this fact here, describing the hero of his first novel as "a kind of me". "I knew I wanted to write a novel," he goes on, "and I knew what it would be about. When you're 21 there really is only one subject. It appears in the mirror each morning, toothbrush in hand."\par \par \uc2 So you've read Shteyngart's three antic, comic, unfailingly energetic and vaguely autobiographical novels. Do you really need to read the memoir? Actually, yes, you do, because Little Failure is terrific - the author's funniest, saddest and most honest work to date. Like many \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  stories, it's a tale of early suffering, gradual assimilation and eventual self-actualisation. But it's also a powerful and often moving portrait of a troubled man's creative origins, comparable in intent (and sometimes in quality) to some of the genre's high-water marks, and owing particular debts to WG Sebald, Thomas Bernhard and, most significantly, Vladimir Nabokov, whose name Shteyngart often invokes.\par \par \uc2 The book is framed by a small mystery: a panic attack that the author suffers in 1996, after he sees, in a used book at New York's Strand bookstore, a photo of a familiar place: "The Chesme Church on Lensovet Street in . . . the city formerly known as Leningrad." He recalls flying a toy helicopter there with his father, before his emigration in 1979 - but why the "nervous, twitching body" and "sweaty hands?" He masters himself, leaves the store, returns to his then life of writerly dissolution and frustration. "What happened," he asks himself, "at the Chesme Church 22 years ago?"\par \par \uc2 Igor (yes, Igor) Shteyngart was born in 1972 in Leningrad into a troubled marriage between a working-class mechanical engineer and a comparatively cultured piano teacher; the couple are handsome and hale, and evidently bewildered by the scrawny and sickly creature they have created. From his father, the asthmatic Shteyngart earns the nickname "Snotty"; his mother will eventually devise the polyglot monicker "Failurchka", or "Little Failure", for the disappointing child. The Shteyngarts struggle to control their son's illness, with his miraculous inhaler still years and a continent away, by holding his mouth open with a tablespoon to enable him to draw breath, and administering a terrifying pseudomedical remedy known as "cupping", which leaves the future novelist with a line of burn marks up and down his spine.\par \par \uc2 The family's move to America is the result of a Jimmy-Carter-brokered trade agreement: "Russia gets the grain it needs to run; America gets the Jews it needs to run." And though it brings the child (now renamed Gary) respiratory relief, new medical horrors await: the family is persuaded to have the boy circumcised, which procedure is promptly botched. "My mother has cut a hole in my underwear," Shteyngart recalls, "so that my broken penis will not have to touch polyester . . . I lie there with my ruined genitalia exposed to the outside world." Relatives come to visit specifically to observe the "awful thing", and for the next two years, "every act of urination has to be done through gritted teeth". This section of the book contains some of the best writing Shteyngart has ever done. If some readers found the earlier books' authorial self-consciousness straying too close to self-pity, they will find none of that here - Shteyngart's compassion for his young self never cloys. Indeed, he achieves an impressive detachment, incorporating into the narrative not only his childhood pain, but his parents' bewilderment and ignorance ("We didn't know") and his very strong, very focused adult anger.\par \par \uc2 There's a lot that Shteyngart has to be angry about: like many future artists, he was bullied and misunderstood. But, if one single subject dominates this book, it's his powerful ambivalence about his eccentric, inept parents: their incapacity to love him unreservedly, the side-effects of their displacement, their hostility and condescension that for years he dismisses as "just cultural". His father calls him "nasty swine" and beats him on the neck; his mother serves him terrible food and subjects him to two-day-long silent treatments. (Even when he becomes successful, they will torture him with criticism of his work that they find on the internet.) And their marriage, the impending dissolution of which haunted the young Shteyngart, suddenly improves the moment he leaves for college.\par \par \uc2 In the end, though, Shteyngart finds a way, if not to absolve his parents, then to understand them; in the book's final chapter, the family returns together to Leningrad. Secrets are revealed, and the mystery of Chesme Church is solved (if not with quite the bang that the first 300 pages seemed to promise). Whereas most chapters are accompanied by a photo of the author embroiled in the events described therein, this one - and the entire book - ends with a handsome portrait of his parents, looking relaxed and happy on the Leningrad trip. We are invited to see them as the complexly flawed people they are; and if Shteyngart has not managed to extract from them the kind of love he always wanted, he has clearly learned to give them some of the love they didn't know how to earn. It's a beautiful and revealing ending, a surprise from a writer who has always been more comfortable with irony and obfuscation.\par \par \uc2 The path to this moment, however, is a bit meandering. Awkward repetitions of certain facts and events betray the book's origins as a series of discretely published essays. And the story flags somewhat once the author finds love, becomes a writer, and sells his novel; with his parents largely off stage and his transformation from underdog to famous author well under way, his angsty humour loses a bit of its edge. But there is great writing even here, as Shteyngart describes his affection for Infocom computer text adventures, his parodic juvenilia (an alternate Torah featuring references to Star Wars, Tom Selleck and John McEnroe), his friendships with older father figures, his adoration of his complicated girlfriends (even the one later imprisoned for attacking a subsequent paramour with a hammer), and his drinking and drug use. There is a hilarious section devoted to his undergraduate years at Oberlin that features a loving portrait of the fiction writer Diane Vreuls, his teacher, who crawls around on her office floor - "all six feet of her plus the gray halo of long hair" - to demonstrate a flaw in his descriptive writing.\par \par \uc2 It must have helped. Though he refers to his work as "the responsibility that will haunt me for the rest of my life", Shteyngart admits that he has never suffered a moment of writer's block. And that's a good thing because he is that rare specimen, a writer who gets better with every book.\par \par \uc2 To order Little Failure for pounds 12.99 with free UK p&p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Underdog to famous author . . .

All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 I'm currently reading The Dark Box: Confession\par \par \uc2 In The Catholic Church, partly because I'm always up for a dose of Catholic history (it's the maddest sort there is) and partly because the only element of my parents' devoutly Catholic upbringing I have ever envied them is the weekly ritual of confession.\par \par \uc2 I don't know about you, but I run on guilt. I feel bad about everything, from little things such as not laying socks properly flat on the radiator to dry to opening an extra tab on my computer (yes, really. It's something to do with only using your fair share, even of an infinite, cost-free resource. Listen, the whole problem is that I don't make the rules, OK?), and work outwards from there.\par \par \uc2 Sure, other things come into play now and again: the need to earn money, or. . . Actually, no, that's it. But my prime motivating force, the engine that powers all else, is guilt. You don't have to be Catholic, of course, to suffer the same fate (though if my anecdotal evidence gleaned from nearly four decades' membership of a family of mentally-convulsing freaks is anything to go by, it does help). It's a temperamental thing. And for those of us who are daily wearied by the ever-accumulating burden it brings, the idea of having somewhere to go every Sunday to be absolved of all your sins (perceived and unperceived, just in case you overlooked something - what catch-all bliss!); and being ascribed a penance has a charm all its own. Just once, I'd like to feel fully shriven, like the bedragoned Eustace in The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader, after Aslan scores through his scaly hide and tears it off to leave him standing there "smooth and soft as a peeled switch", and free.\par \par \uc2 We need to develop a secular alternative. "I can see it now," Toryboy says - and I won't lie (can you imagine the internal contortions if I did?), there is something faintly contemptuous about his tone. "Queues of liberals outside a recycled cardboard confessional in a community centre. 'Forgive me, Father/Mother/Caregiver of either or indeterminate gender, for when somebody made a joke at my dinner table about \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , I did not fully ascertain that it was meant meta-ironically before I laughed; nor did I later offset the carbon I emitted while doing so.' 'Write four articles on intersectionality and walk to Waitrose with organic peas in your shoes, while checking your privilege as penance,' your soggy, proportionally represented elected excuse for a father confessor will say. 'And forgive me for being in a position to forgive you.' God almighty. Who art in heaven, actually, and is much better."\par \par \uc2 You would think that being an atheist would be liberating, but in fact it doesn't make sense. If you believe that there is no god, and that religion is an agglomeration of useful traditions and practices that has evolved to manage our desires and fears, then paralysing panic when these are stripped from you by the rational parts of your brain are entirely logical responses.\par \par \uc2 "All you need is someone bigger to shout loudly at you," Toryboy says. "Which works out very well for me." I hope he's right. Then maybe the only thing I'll feel bad about is the fact that I don't feel worse.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140221ea2m000gi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

The red carpet will be rolled out in even more style when the German chancellor visits London: she will address both houses of parliament and meet the Queen.\par \par \uc2 Downing Street hopes Mr Cameron's hospitality to two of his strongest natural allies in Europe will help Britain to secure a plum job on the \uc2 European Commission\uc2  this year, and lay the ground work for a longer-term reduction in powers held by the EU.\par \par \uc2 A Number 10 official said: "The meeting with \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  is a sign of the deep links between the two countries.\par \par \uc2 "This is a good time for the prime minister to be meeting his European counterparts, as they start to think about what they want from Europe over the next few years."\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron hopes to make Mr Rutte a key ally in his push for a repatriation of powers from Brussels to sovereign governments. The Netherlands said recently that its policy towards the bloc was: "Europe if necessary - national where possible."\par \par \uc2 Ms Merkel's support is even more important, which is why she will be granted the rare honour of addressing both houses of parliament - the first German leader to do so for 28 years.\par \par \uc2 She will make her address in the large and ornate robing room, where the Queen usually puts on her ceremonial crown and robes before the state opening of parliament. Ms Merkel will also meet the Queen privately, with no officials present.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron will then use a private meeting of his own to lobby Ms Merkel on a range of issues. They include securing a senior economic role for the UK's next EU commissioner, who will take over this year from Lady Ashton, the bloc's foreign policy chief.\par \par \uc2 London ideally wants the single market portfolio held by Michel Barnier, rather than the foreign policy role, which officials view to have been ineffective in protecting Britain's interests.\par \par \uc2 More importantly for Mr Cameron's long-term aims, he will also push for European reform on access to social security benefits and on freedom of movement, which he hopes to secure before a 2017 referendum on Britain's EU membership.\par \par \uc2 Ms Merkel is likely to be receptive to the prime minister's argument that it is too easy for EU migrants to claim benefits in their host nations, having established a committee in Berlin to look into the same question.\par \par \uc2 But German officials say the chancellor will be more robust in defending the principle of free movement - in defiance of Mr Cameron's wish to ensure that new member states enjoy full freedom of movement only if their national in-comes reach a certain level. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German foreign minister, gave a flavour of Ms Merkel's likely response when he visited Britain two weeks ago.\par \par \uc2 Mr Steinmeier told a press conference he did not support changes to freedom of movement, saying: "The \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  of a larger workforce is not always a problem. In certain cases, it is part of the solution."\par \par \uc2 Ms Merkel is also likely to dampen British hopes for a change to the European treaties. The UK hopes this process would allow it to lobby for wider changes to the balance of power between Brussels and sovereign governments.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140222ea2m0000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 'When it comes to recruiting beyond our national borders, small companies suffer'\par \par \uc2 Talent is internationally mobile, we are told. Certainly, here in our little business we looked to the US last year when we were hiring, and we now have a colleague whose moderated Connecticut vowels make the office sound very international. We work in a specialist area, and our team in London arguably already representshalf of the UK's entire talent pool relevant to that field. No wonder we decided to look beyond national boundaries when we needed to hire.\par \par \uc2 Of course, this is not easy. Idon't know why Nigel Farage is so worried about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . It's harder to get a work permit for a non-EU citizen to work as a specialist hire in the UK than it is toget a hair appointment with Nicky Clarke on a Friday. We had toapply to the Home Office to become an official sponsoring company, and only when that was granted could we start to do everything to show that we could not recruit anyone suitable in the UK. The next stage was to identify our US target and apply for a work permit on his behalf.\par \par \uc2 Peter has marked his arrival by installing a whacky new coffee machine in the kitchen. We already have instant coffee, a \uc2 Nespresso\uc2  machine and a cafetiere. He insists on referring to the latter as a "French press", which sounds more like something Christian Trevelyan Grey might use. I was more interested to know why we needed another coffee delivery system. Because, my new young American told me, this is filter coffee, so it percolates more and therefore is better. He only has himself to blame for now being christened Percolating Pete.\par \par \uc2 PP retorted that he had expected me to call him Annoying American. He is quite an Adorable American, actually, and still has a two at the front of his age so I am sure we can mould him to our way of doing things. I have bought him a dinner jacket and required him to escort me to several formal dinners. He found the Loyal Toast a bit confusing the first time he heard it. As hundreds of fellow diners stood and lifted their glasses to the Queen, PP looked around anxiously. "Where is she sitting?" he asked.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to recruiting beyond our national borders, small companies like us suffer disproportionately with red tape and legal fees - just one look at the Home Office paperwork had me lying down in a dark room. How are we going to manage if Scotland declares independence?\par \par \uc2 I know the debate right now is all about currency and Scotland being refused the right to keep the pound. That is the least of my worries. What is annoying is the assortment of foreign currencies hanging round my desk after my recent stint of travel. Even the burglars left them behind when they dropped by for 11minutes last month. Why can't we have a world currency? OK, I know why not. But even so, all these bits of loose change are Very Annoying.\par \par \uc2 My main concern is that an independent Scotland would not have much chance of joining the EU. That means we will have to stop recruiting from Scotland. We employ a disproportionate number of our staff from Scottish universities; if I have to go throughthe whole Home Office saga for them, we may have to retreat to England and Wales for our recruitment. Is that really whatpeople want? I know that 16-and 17-year-olds are being allowed to vote in the referendum, and I hope that they will be the oneswho aspire to work in companies like ours.\par \par \uc2 I am proud to be part of the United Kingdom - the Moneypennys have a strong Scottish heritage, despite some Antipodean dilution. Three hundredyears of union has made usmuch stronger as a nation. Scotland has a lot of talent in its young people and the free movement of labour back and forth over the border is hugely valuable, especially to employers. I hope that the Scots will vote for the Union, and save me masses of paperwork. Ican promise them interesting jobs - and lots of nice coffee.\par \par \uc2 mrsmoneypenny@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140222ea2m0002l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Fashion conversations Solange Azagury-Partridge talks to Tom Dixon\par \par \uc2 Solange Azagury-Partridge is founder and owner of her eponymous jewellery label, which has stores in London and New York. The former creative director of French jewellery house Boucheron, she has a celebrity following that includes Thandie Newton, Emma Watson and Sienna Miller. Born in London to parents of Moroccan descent, she lives in west London with her husband, the screenwriter Murray Partridge, and their two children.\par \par \uc2 Tom Dixon OBE is the former creative director of Habitat. London-based, he was born in Tunisia to a French mother and English father and is now creative director of his own brand, Tom Dixon, specialising in lighting, furniture and accessories, as well as Design Research Studio, an interior and architectural design studio.\par \par \uc2 How we met Dixon The first time we met is lost in the mists of time. It's all a blur. Azagury-Partridge It has been nearly 30 years. You DJ'd at my wedding. I think you were going out with Marie-H\u233\'00\'E9l\u232\'00\'E8ne [de Taillac, the French jewellery designer], who I was working with at the time. There was that French connection. Also we discovered that we both have north-African roots.\par \par \uc2 Dixon And were both brought up bilingual. I think we have a dual sense of humour, too.\par \par \uc2 Azagury-Partridge We speak franglais to each other.\par \par \uc2 Dixon It wasn't just social. When I was at Habitat I commissioned some objects from you. You came up with a fabulous safe, which was the perfect crossover between our two worlds.\par \par \uc2 Creative differences\par \par \uc2 Dixon People always ask me what advice I would give a young designer and I always say that the most difficult thing to do now is to have a unique design personality. You have that.\par \par \uc2 Azagury-Partridge What I love about your work is that you have a really strong point of view but you have always wanted that to be for everybody. You are always experimenting with materials that are innovative and trying to do them in a mass way. Sometimes I know exactly how you have come to an idea because I feel that our creativity crosses over.\par \par \uc2 Dixon Yeah. We share some references, like psychedelia, mathematics . . .\par \par \uc2 Azagury-Partridge . . . the 1970s, geometry. That's what makes me feel so close to your work. For me it is like jewellery for the home.\par \par \uc2 Dixon The other thing we share is that our work is about creating a whole universe. We are both happy to turn our hand to a variety of things, from perfume to film to music. That is a very British trait - being the enthusiastic amateur.\par \par \uc2 Azagury-Partridge I am a typical Brit in the way that I'm not 100 per cent English. I am English but my parents are \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and I think that is a very British thing - to bring something "other" to the mix.\par \par \uc2 Technology and craft\par \par \uc2 Dixon If there is anything that ties it all together for me it's that I'm really interested in factories and techniques. I love nothing more than going to a factory in India or Poland or Newcastle and seeing how people are making things and thinking, "What if we did something in a different way?" It is always about making stuff. My real pleasure has always been the physical connection with the materials or the new tool that I've just bought.\par \par \uc2 Azagury-Partridge I do think there needs to be a visceral reaction to things. If you don't get that, it's just meaningless. That's what I think is the missing link with a lot of computer-generated design.\par \par \uc2 Dixon I'm absolutely not anti-technology - I find it fascinating; it is another tool in the toolkit. I think what has changed is that there are so many more people engaged in design now. If something is interesting, then it is broadcast round the world in such a way that it becomes public property almost immediately. So it is harder and harder for young designers to find the space to develop unique stuff.\par \par \uc2 Azagury-Partridge I started with just a typewriter, and then we were so excited when we got a fax machine. And then we got a computer and were even more excited. It all feels like pre-history! Now I see students in their first year at college working in a way that probably took me five years to get to.\par \par \uc2 Dixon We should be careful of sounding like old gits.\par \par \uc2 Azagury-Partridge I am an old git! But when it comes to a certain style you just have to say, this is the way I do it, this is my vision. I design in quite a traditional way. I like to draw my designs, draw them from several angles, and then we'll make a maquette [model] . . . because even if you see it in 3D on the computer, something is missing, it can be very empty. Jewellery is very tactile. I suppose you don't know how you are going to feel about a piece of jewellery until you hold it in your hand. I've got my two shops - soon to be three, when Paris opens - and they give me a connection with the people who buy my things. When I had investors I got to the point that I was opening lots of shops and producing lots of stuff, and that was one of the things I swore to myself I wouldn't do - I wouldn't become a production-line jewellery designer. Doing what I do, you just can't pump it out.\par \par \uc2 Dixon I'm the opposite of you - it interests me to mass distribute what I design. We are wholesaling to 60 countries all over the world and it has got to a scale where it suddenly all makes sense.\par \par \uc2 Azagury-Partridge It is massive, what you do.\par \par \uc2 Dixon I've always been jealous of you as a jeweller. You can do a trunk show and just turn up with a suitcase and have enough in that suitcase to really make a living. I'm amazed by the tininess of it all. I don't know how you do it.\par \par \uc2 Azagury-Partridge Well, I don't do it personally but you should see the fingers of these guys that do; they are twice the size of mine. To be a craftsperson at that level you have to have a certain kind of Zen. It's like meditation. That's not my forte.\par \par \uc2 Dixon You are impatient like me.\par \par \uc2 Azagury-PartridgeYes. But that's what fuels me, keeps me going.\par \par \uc2 Ambitions\par \par \uc2 Dixon Where do you begin? I've just started doing architecture for a client of ours. I've never designed a washing machine, I've never done audio, transport . . . fashion or civil engineering. Maybe I could do some jewellery just to wind you up?\par \par \uc2 Azagury-PartridgeWhat I'd like to do is to turn technology into jewellery. Your telephone should be a pair of earrings - beautiful earrings that nobody knows are something practical too.\par \par \uc2 Dixon You are not just going to hang a couple of Nokias off your ears are you? We are doing a lot of interiors now and what is great is that you get to surround the objects you create with a sensibility. That's what is so brilliant about this space [Azagury-Partridge's Mayfair store]. What you have managed to do is to make the jewellery box so much bigger, you get absorbed into this magic kingdom that you've created.\par \par \uc2 For more fashion conversations, go to ft.com/styleconversations\par \par \uc2 David Hayes\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140222ea2m0005i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

Time to find out, as Adele Thomas directs a bit of sprightly nonsense and meta-theatrical mayhem. What begins as an apparently run of the mill comedy of manners suddenly changes course when two members of the audience invade the stage and start fixing the play to fit in with their tastes. Period piece or strikingly modern drama? Actors Phil Daniels, Matthew Needham and Pauline McLynn join the chaos. shakespearesglobe.com, 020 7401 9919, now previewing, runs to March 30\par \par \uc2 The Full Monty\par \par \uc2 Noel Coward Theatre, London\par \par \uc2 The 1997 film was a great success, and Simon Beaufoy's new stage version went down a storm when it played in Sheffield last year (the location of the story). Now the tale of six unemployed steelworkers who embark on a mad plan to do a live striptease to raise some cash arrives in the West End. Kenny Doughty plays Gaz, the ringleader, and the comedy is directed by \uc2 Daniel Evans\uc2 . For all the laughs, this is a sad and serious piece about unemployment, recession and loss of identity. And yes, they do do the "full monty." fullmontytheplay.com, 0844 482 5141, now previewing, booking to June 14\par \par \uc2 I Do\par \par \uc2 Hilton Hotel, Islington, London\par \par \uc2 Weddings are wonderful occasions for backstage dramas and with this in mind, the site specific company Dante or Die has come up with an immersive piece that looks at the crises and comedies surrounding one ceremony. Audiences, split into six groups, take turns to visit six different rooms in the hotel, where various guests and key players (including the bride and groom) are in various shades of disarray and emotional extremity. danteordie.com, almeida.co.uk, 020 7359 4404, previews February 26, opens February 27, runs to March 9\par \par \uc2 1984\par \par \uc2 Almeida, London\par \par \uc2 Headlong's brilliant adaptation, directed by Robert Icke and Duncan Macmillman, doesn't just transpose George Orwell's chilling novel to stage, but creates a dynamic contemporary response. Drawing on the appendix to the novel, entitled "The Principles of Newspeak", the show combines past, present and future and uses multiple layers of action and several media to create a terrifying world in which the truth is never certain. The affair between Winston (Mark Arends) and Julia (Hara Yannas) is still central, but the framework around them keeps shifting. It's a production that punctures complacency as it suggests that our own ideas of freedom of choice and action may be far more manipulated than we imagine. almeida.co.uk, 020 7359 4404, runs to March 29\par \par \uc2 Oh What a Lovely War\par \par \uc2 Theatre Royal, Stratford East, London\par \par \uc2 Joan Littlewood's staging of this show 50 years ago at this theatre was a landmark production in so many ways. Its multi-layered, end-of-the-pier style used the songs that the soldiers sang to create a show that was popular, shocking and deeply upsetting and that played a seminal role in theatre development. Now director \uc2 Terry Johnson\uc2  revives it in a lovingly affectionate production. It shows its age where the satire is concerned, coming over as rather heavy-handed and laborious. But the songs emerge as tartly and poignantly affecting as ever: a direct link with all those ordinary soldiers who made up the terrible statistics of battle losses that run across the electronic display board behind the action. stratfordeast.com, 020 8534 0310, runs to March 15\par \par \uc2 Superior Donuts\par \par \uc2 Southwark Playhouse, London\par \par \uc2 With August: Osage County recently in cinemas, here is a chance to see the UK premiere of a Tracy Letts play on the stage. Letts explores the price of the American Dream through the medium of a small donut shop in Chicago. Arthur Przybyszewski is struggling to keep the shop, set up by his Polish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  father, afloat amid the twin rivals of big chains such as \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  and organic coffee shops. It survives thanks to its motley collection of regular customers. But when Arthur employs a new worker, Franco, things take a twist. In keeping with its subject, the play is a little sugary, but it also offers a touching analysis of hope and survival and is well served in Ned Bennett's production. southwarkplayhouse.co.uk 020 7407 0234, runs to March 8\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140222ea2m0006q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW RELEASES FILM OF THE WEEK\par \par \uc2 NYMPHOMANIAC VOLUMES I & II (18)\par \par \uc2 ****\par \par \uc2 Dir. Lars von Trier; Starring Charlotte Gainsbourg, Stellan Skarsgard, 241mins\par \par \uc2 "It will be long," warns Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) at the start of Lars von Trier's controversy-baiting diptych about the sex life of a self-diagnosed nymphomaniac and sinner. (Cinemas will show both feature-length volumes separately, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to see one without the other.) "And moral, I'm afraid." To which we should add that it will not be to everyone's taste. And it certainly isn't for those who have found the cumulative masochistic suffering of Von Trier's earlier female characters unpalatable.\par \par \uc2 But it is funny as well as punishing and bleak. It is erudite, digressive, teasing, self-aware, self-mocking, and impossible to mistake for the work of anyone else.\par \par \uc2 Joe unburdens herself, in eight discrete chapters, to Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard), a passing ascetic confessor who has found her lying bruised and bloodied in a cobbled London alleyway. Acting as a kind of one-man Greek chorus, he interjects with musings on everything from fly-fishing and Fibonacci numbers to Zeno's paradox and the devil's interval - perhaps simply because he finds the detail of her story too sordid, but more likely in an effort to attach some meaning to what is otherwise a pointlessly miserable story about lovelessness and degradation. "This is nothing more than a blasphemous retelling of the transfiguration of Jesus on the mountain," he exclaims at one point. By which time, you know he's over-reaching.\par \par \uc2 But depending on which side of the film's Platonic dialogue you side with, Nymphomaniac is either the thoroughly miserable story of a woman who discovers too late that love is not just a bourgeois construct, and that you can neither entirely validate or entirely negate the self with sex alone; or it is a profane celebration of the human condition and all of its varied glories and bathetic weaknesses. You really can choose to go either way.\par \par \uc2 Only Lovers Left Alive (15)\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Dir. Jim Jarmusch; Starring Tom Hiddleston, Tilda Swinton, 123mins\par \par \uc2 Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton star as the most elegantly louche vampire couple since Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie in The Hunger: he's a depressed rock'n'roll recluse living amid vintage audio equipment in a faded apartment in Detroit while she hangs out with Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt) in Tangiers. They both wear sunglasses at night, and they consume human blood like it's high-grade heroin. This being a Jim Jarmusch film, not a lot happens; the mood and the pop culture references are everything. A big improvement on his previous film, The Limits of Control, it has the hint of a droll smile playing on its bloody lips.\par \par \uc2 Stranger By The Lake (18)\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Dir. \uc2 Alain Guiraudie\uc2 ; Starring Pierre Deladonchamps, Christophe Paou, 100mins\par \par \uc2 Set entirely at a French lakeshore that is used as a popular gay cruising spot, this confrontational film combines a wry comedy of manners - affecting a sociological detachment, but filmed at crotch-level and with oodles of explicit sex - with a psychological thriller about a young innocent's attraction to a man he knows to be sociopathic killer. You might think it was saying something rather bleak about the risks promiscuous gay men take, if its mood wasn't so sunny and carefree.\par \par \uc2 Stalingrad (15)\par \par \uc2 **\par \par \uc2 Dir. Fedor Bondarchuk; Starring Petr Fedorov, Dmitry Lisenkov, 131mins\par \par \uc2 The director of this 3D Imax spectacular uses every digital tool at his disposal in order to envision the seige of Stalingrad as a kind of ash-strewn seventh circle of hell. But while it achieves a visual grandeur and has a certain bloodthirsty zeal, its characters are dull, the action is implausible and the morality is simplistic.\par \par \uc2 A World Not Ours (NC)\par \par \uc2 ****\par \par \uc2 Dir. Mahdi Fleifel, 93mins\par \par \uc2 The London-based director Mahdi Fleifel provides a camcordered insider's guide to his - for want of another word - homeland: the 1km2 Palestinian refugee camp Ain al-Hilweh in southern Lebanon, whose inhabitants live in a kind of existentially absurd stasis. It is an intimate, bittersweet documentary full of everyday comedy and life, but streaked with violence and the particular hopelessness of the dispossessed and stateless.\par \par \uc2 The Godfather Part II (15)\par \par \uc2 *****\par \par \uc2 Dir. Francis Ford Coppola; Starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, 192mins\par \par \uc2 Moving forwards from the original in order to watch Michael (Al Pacino) consolidate his position as the new godfather of the Corleone family and expand the reach of his power to Las Vegas and Cuba; and backwards, to watch his father Vito (Robert De Niro) first turning to crime as a young \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  in 1910s New York, this magisterial, superbly acted, richly detailed and thematically complex film is the Mafia movie as Shakespearean drama.\par \par \uc2 A New York Winter's Tale (12A)\par \par \uc2 **\par \par \uc2 Dir. Akiva Goldsman; Starring Colin Farrell, Jessica Brown Findlay, 118mins\par \par \uc2 Beginning with the premises that starlight is actually the twinkle of angels' wings and that everyone is allocated one miracle at birth, this earnestly religiose and yet underwhelming fantasy, adapted from the 1983 novel Winter's Tale by Mark Helprin, then intertwines the fates of a roguish foundling thief in New York, his consumptive true love, an Irish demon played by Russell Crowe, a young girl with cancer, Lucifer, who is played by Will Smith, and a magical flying white horse. It asks its viewer to suspend their disbelief rather too far.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140222ea2m0000g\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Page 3 Profile JOE NEWMAN CONGRESS CONTENDER\b0\par\par\uc2 Oscar Quine   \par \uc2 352 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par \uc2 i\par \uc2 IIND\par \uc2 1ST\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd.

He might just be about to become a very powerful man.\par \par \uc2 How's that?\par \par \uc2 The resident of Florida - a state famous for its aging population and retirement communities - has launched a campaign to run for the \uc2 US Congress\uc2  in November, making him the oldest ever contender.\par \par \uc2 You can't trump experience.\par \par \uc2 He certainly thinks so. On his website, joenewman101.com, the son of 20th-century Russian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  says his age is his greatest asset. "At 101, my 'fruit of experience' far surpasses everyone else in this congressional race," Newman wrote. A win would make him the oldest currently serving member of Congress - beating Ralph Hall, 90, by over a decade.\par \par \uc2 What are his policies?\par \par \uc2 Describing himself as "a fiery advocate of social change for more than a half-century", he plans to run on a platform that includes increasing the minimum wage and providing health care for all. He's said he hopes his story will: "inspire citizens of all ages and walks of life to get involved, get engaged and to become active patriot leaders".\par \par \uc2 A social warrior!\par \par \uc2 Indeed. Living through the Great Depression and two world wars, Newman directly assisted with the initial launch of the nation's Social Security program. Now living alone, he says he keeps his mind in tip-top condition by reading newspapers, and history and politics books.\par \par \uc2 Does he have a chance?\par \par \uc2 The November midterms signal a big reshuffle in US politics: the entire House of Representatives and a third of the Senate seats are up for grabs. But it is, of course, too early to say, although Newman is already up against four other, considerably younger, candidates.\par \par \uc2 And a catchy campaign slogan?\par \par \uc2 Not quite. But we like this, from his very own \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account: "A vote for the old man is a vote for the New Man!"

He points out that in 1505 San Juan became the first city now in US territory to be settled by Europeans. Nowadays, the first Spanish colonies in Puerto Rico, Florida and the Southwest have a more significant meaning for electoral politics than the founding families of the Mayflower. Even fictional Hispano-American characters such as Zorro and the Cisco Kid, who battled bad gringos in defence of poor Californios, are now used to reinforce America\u8217\'20\'19s heroic character. Just as the sense of being American brought British and Spanish colonists closer together in the 18th century, so the Hispanic history of America confirms the capacity of Americans to construct a cultural unity founded in diversity.\par \par \uc2 Our America: A Hispanic History of the United States by Felipe Fern\u225\'00\'E1ndez-Armesto, Norton, 402pp; \u163\'00\'A317.99.

She is blonde, pretty, heavily made-up, eloquent, softly spoken and extremely friendly \u8212\'20\'14 the very opposite of the EDL\u8217\'20\'19s typical public image.\par \par \uc2 EDL march near London's Tower Bridge\par \par \uc2 Gail, who is currently unemployed, poses for pictures with her EDL flag, then we begin an unflinchingly honest, three-hour talk.\par \par \uc2 She says: \u8220\'20\'1CWhat attracted me to the EDL was the passion for country. It drew me in immediately. I\u8217\'20\'19d lived in Leeds for 20 years and seen a massive change.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CChristianity has been pushed aside. Islam is forced on our kids.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are getting pushed out and it is causing anger. It is creeping Sharia law.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt gets me angry that this country \u8212\'20\'14 and especially Yorkshire \u8212\'20\'14 are getting driven down. People call Bradford \u8216\'20\'18Bradistan\u8217\'20\'19 now.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere should be a total stop on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . The EDL will be coming out soon with that message. We should help \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  if they have a bona fide reason, like losing their lives if they get sent home.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut if they turn up on the back of lorries? They are sponging. Britain needs a backbone again."\par \par \uc2 Gail accepts the group has at times suffered from a bad image \u8212\'20\'14 notably last October when its high-profile founder Tommy Robinson departed over concerns that it had been infiltrated by \u8220\'20\'1Cfar-Right extremists".\par \par \uc2 There have also been many arrests and clashes with police at marches, like the one in east London in September.\par \par \uc2 But the group still declares itself a rising force, lifted up by growing anti-Islamic sentiment in the wake of the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby.\par \par \uc2 And Gail thinks girl power can only help.\par \par \uc2 She recalls: \u8220\'20\'1CThere were no women involved when I joined.\par \par \uc2 Young and old EDL supporters in Greater Manchester\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSo I got on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and decided to rally for more women. I called myself Gail Angel and got a tremendous response.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWomen\u8217\'20\'19s issues need to be talked about more. I have the balls to do it in a very male-dominated world.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMothers want to fight for our kids\u8217\'20\'19 future. A lot of men just go for a drink, but there is a pure, patriotic passion in the EDL. There is no malice."\par \par \uc2 And Gail is proud to claim that she has drawn more women by challenging their ideas of what female activists look like.\par \par \uc2 She explains: \u8220\'20\'1CThey expect big, butch lesbian-looking types. A hell of a lot of other women have come forward since seeing my \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page or \uc2 YouTube\uc2  clips of me.\par \par \uc2 Chain-smoking and sipping tea as two burly dogs scratch and whine next door, she continues: \u8220\'20\'1CWomen bring out the softer side of the EDL. The motivating forces are higher."\par \par \uc2 Gail claims her unusual perspective as an EDL member and mother allows her to tackle the issues facing many Muslim women, most notably Pakistani sex grooming gangs and Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).\par \par \uc2 EDL demo in London\par \par \uc2 She explains: \u8220\'20\'1CAn issue that breaks my heart are the Muslim grooming gangs. When I say Muslim, you could be black, brown, white \u8212\'20\'14 I don\u8217\'20\'19t care about the colour of your skin. I do care about what you\u8217\'20\'19re doing to our children.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI know there are white paedophiles, too, but if you read some of the Koran, it says it is OK to marry a child. It\u8217\'20\'19s child abuse.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWomen understand more. I read about a 12-year-old girl who\u8217\'20\'19d been groomed. It devastated me. The gangs like to get them when they\u8217\'20\'19re vulnerable. These men prey on these girls and destroy their lives.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBecause I\u8217\'20\'19ve been outspoken about the issue, I\u8217\'20\'19ve had so many girls approaching me. And a lot of mothers have said that had happened to their daughters.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COne woman approached me at a rally and said her daughter had been raped 20 times by a grooming gang. She wanted to speak at the rally but the police wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t let her."\par \par \uc2 Gail continues: \u8220\'20\'1CWith FGM they are mutilating these girls so they have no pleasure, so they are \u8216\'20\'18clean\u8217\'20\'19 \u8212\'20\'14 it is horrendous.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey are doing it in the summer holidays by going abroad, but they are also doing it here in the UK. That is just child abuse to me.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI have spoken to four Muslim girls who have approached me via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . They come forward because they know we are going to listen and not judge them. It is not safe to talk to their parents \u8212\'20\'14 and certainly no man."\par \par \uc2 In the BBC3 documentary, the crew follow Gail during a recent court case where she claimed she was attacked by a Muslim with an iron bar, then had her jaw broken by two Muslim men in a separate altercation in May.\par \par \uc2 In November, the jury found the men not guilty, but Gail feels it was the EDL, not her alleged assailants, who were on trial.\par \par \uc2 She says: \u8220\'20\'1CThe police said I was trying to provoke a riot. I\u8217\'20\'19d been attacked but never treated like a victim. To me the case should have been about me getting attacked, but it was the EDL on trial."\par \par \uc2 Gail is resolute that neither she or the EDL is racist. She says: \u8220\'20\'1CRacist is the most overused, pathetic word.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMost of the EDL people I know don\u8217\'20\'19t care about colour. We just want to fight the issues.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is no political party that speaks for our people. UKIP says it will stop \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  for two years but it isn\u8217\'20\'19t enough.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are out to win the hearts and minds of those who don\u8217\'20\'19t feel they are being listened to."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:martin.daubney@the-sun.co.uk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 martin.daubney@the-sun.co.uk }}}\par \par \uc2 Set up by football hooligan\par \par \uc2 FOOTBALL supporters founded the EDL nearly five years ago to fight what they consider to be a spread of Islam, Sharia law and Islamic extremism in the UK.\par \par \uc2 The protest group sprang up in Luton as a collective of local soccer \u8220\'20\'1Cfirms" in June 2009 who put aside their club differences in protest at an extremist Islamic organisation.\par \par \uc2 EDL Leader Tommy Robinson\par \par \uc2 Al-Muhajiroun\uc2  had outraged them by staging an anti-war demonstration during a march by local troops just home from Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 Leader Tommy Robinson repeatedly insisted that the EDL was only \u8220\'20\'1Cagainst the rise of radical Islam".

Miliband recently gave the Parliamentary Labour Party a pep talk about strategy for the year ahead but failed to make any mention of the referendum debate. \u8220\'20\'1CThe word Europe did not cross his lips once during the entire presentation," one Labour MP told me.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The Labour leader is instinctively deeply uncomfortable with the idea of referendums and fears that giving in to demands for one about Europe could come back to haunt him.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Despite Labour\u8217\'20\'19s relatively slender opinion poll lead he dreams that the electoral arithmetic can put him into 10 Downing Street at the next election and genuinely fears he could end up being prime minister of a country that votes to quit the EU.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMiliband\u8217\'20\'19s nightmare is a waferthin Labour majority, a resurgent Tory Party led by a new Euro-sceptic leader \u8211\'20\'13 Boris Johnson for example \u8211\'20\'13 and a referendum within 18 months," one source close to a leading Labour donor told me.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The conclusion the Labour leader\u8217\'20\'19s inner circle drew from Labour\u8217\'20\'19s thumping margin of victory in last week\u8217\'20\'19s Wythenshawe and Sale East by-election is that Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s UK Independence Party is stealing plenty of Tory votes but is not a threat to Labour.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Tory-Ukip share of the vote was the same in the by-election as at the general election. There is no sign of Ukip taking Labour voters," said a senior Labour source.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Many party insiders believe that smacks of dangerous complacency given that the poll was held in Labour\u8217\'20\'19s heartlands and followed the death of local MP Paul Goggins who was hugely popular in the constituency.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Ukip have made no secret of their desire to attract blue-collar voters who traditionally backed Labour but feel betrayed by the last government on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and welfare. Some shadow ministers privately admit that the anti-Brussels party is gaining ground in Labour territory.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Miliband is set to make a final decision about how to respond to Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s referendum pledge after votes are counted in May\u8217\'20\'19s elections for the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 . But with the polls suggesting Labour could turn in a creditable performance that result could well simply reinforce his conviction that a referendum on EU membership is best avoided.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 However it is unlikely to allay the concerns within the Shadow Cabinet. Some frontbenchers are worried that Labour is going into the euro election campaign without a clear position on the referendum question and are mystified about what the party\u8217\'20\'19s manifesto for the Euro elections will say on the crucial issue.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Even more importantly they are desperately worried about the signal that Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s refusal to back an EU referendum sends to the electorate. His opposition to giving voters a say about the country\u8217\'20\'19s future could well be taken as a sign of contempt.\par \par \uc2 ........................................................................\par \par \uc2 All is quiet on the Westminster front as MPs sit idle\par \par \uc2 WESTMINSTER has been through a quiet week with MPs away on yet another mini-break and ministers off sploshing around in flooded areas.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Yet Parliament has felt only slightly less busy in recess than on sitting days over recent months given the severe shortage of legislation passing through the Commons and the Lords.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere really is very little for us to do here at the moment," one MP told me before heading off. \u8220\'20\'1CIt feels as if we are just marking time until the general election."\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Tory and Lib Dem ministers are so focused on highlighting their differences in the run-up to next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election that they are struggling to agree any new coalition measures.

It looks like we can\u8217\'20\'19t hold the Queen\u8217\'20\'19s Speech until June," said the MP. Because Government departments are banned from making policy announcements during the \u8220\'20\'1Cpurdah" period in the run-up to elections the monarch\u8217\'20\'19s ceremonial visit to Parliament has had to be delayed by weeks.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 And the result is MPs will have even more time than they expected to fritter away before the Government\u8217\'20\'19s programme for the final year of this Parliament is announced.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The lack of legislation has become so acute that a Commons business paper for the week ahead put aside one day for the presentation of a Bill without giving any indication as to what the Bill was going to be about. Ministers suspect that the light workload is giving backbenchers plenty of time for plotting and mischief making.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The MP added: \u8220\'20\'1CPart of the reason why there have been so many revolts is that we just haven\u8217\'20\'19t got enough work to do."\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Perhaps voters should be grateful for a period of calm from our law makers.

\par\par \uc2 Columnists\par \b \uc2 The British live upstairs, and Poles downstairs; We no longer feel embarrassed to hire cleaners and other domestic help \u8212\'20\'14 but only foreign workers are happy to live with us\b0\par\par\uc2 Janice Turner   \par \uc2 986 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par 00:01\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 When watching Downton Abbey, I know my place. The likes of my ancestors weren\u8217\'20\'19t clinking crystal in the great hall but scrubbing the scullery below stairs.\par \par \uc2 My late aunts were in service. My Auntie Nora cared for an old lady in Middlesex until her death, then her two adult sons. My Auntie Olive, a cook, is described in references as of \u8220\'20\'1Cgood honest character". There was high demand for solid, hard-grafting Yorkshire girls in middle-class southern homes. And until the Second World War drafted you off to pack parachutes or roll cordite, it was the best job available if you\u8217\'20\'19d left your pit village school at 14.\par \par \uc2 Did my aunts mind living far from home with a strange family? Did they find it degrading to clean for their \u8220\'20\'1Cbetters"? As members of that deferential, modest war generation, I\u8217\'20\'19d guess not. Besides, these girls had skivvied at home, black-leading grates and cranking mangles. At least in service they got paid.\par \par \uc2 This week the Labour MP Frank Field declared that the problem with today\u8217\'20\'19s young British people was that they were too grand. \u8220\'20\'1CA new servant class, equal to that of Downton Abbey times, has been re-created," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s not upstairs and downstairs any more, though. The elite bring the servant class in when they want cleaning done, ironing, gardening . . ."\par \par \uc2 But alas, says Mr Field, the rich take on cheap \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  labour to wash dishes and change nappies. Youth unemployment sits stubbornly at about a million because even in London \u8212\'20\'14 which is bursting with the wealthy and domestically indolent \u8212\'20\'14 young Brits feel drudgery is beneath them. Cut off their benefits, Mr Field says, then they\u8217\'20\'19d swallow their pride. And Home Office figures confirm that last year 100,000 fewer British people were in unskilled jobs than in 2011, with one job in ten going to Bulgarians or Romanians, even before restrictions were lifted.\par \par \uc2 As Voltaire said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe comfort of the rich depends upon an abundant supply of the poor." The more unequal a society, the more it spends on household help. In 1978, when a CEO earned about 30 times more than his average worker, domestic services as a proportion of expenditure were at their lowest. This has quadrupled in real terms now that a CEO brings in 200 times his employee. There are now as many domestic workers in London as in Victorian times.\par \par \uc2 So what are the new rules for employing servants? No one seems to care, feasting on this cheap convenient labour, barely checking if it\u8217\'20\'19s legal, as shown by the resignation of Mark Harper, the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister whose Colombian cleaner had no work permit, and the fining of Baroness Scotland for employing an illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 . David Gauke, the Exchequer Secretary, has said it is \u8220\'20\'1Cmorally wrong" to pay cleaners cash but who doesn\u8217\'20\'19t leave a handful of tenners under the fruit bowl?\par \par \uc2 Twenty years ago, in liberal circles, a cleaner was your shameful secret. Too lazy or posh to Jif your own bath? Hark at Lady Muck. Some of my friends insisted that doing housework kept them \u8220\'20\'1Cgrounded". Those who had a cleaner rushed around guiltily before she arrived.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps only egalitarian societies feel servant-shame. Recently, I asked Adam Price, the creator of the Danish political drama Borgen why Birgitte, his fictional Prime Minister, didn\u8217\'20\'19t solve her childcare headaches with a nanny. He said that in Denmark a nursery or grandparent was fine. But employing a nanny would be seen as putting on airs. Indeed, when I met the real Danish PM, \uc2 Helle Thorning-Schmidt\uc2 , she was aghast when I joked that her bodyguards could help to carry her supermarket bags.\par \par \uc2 Over the past decade one million more British people have started employing a cleaner. For couples, it is worth \u163\'00\'A310-plus an hour to sidestep marital disputes about bin-bags and skid marks. The head of Molly Maid, a huge domestic cleaning agency, told me that even in the recession her clients rarely cancelled but switched from a weekly to monthly service. (Pity the poor cleaners!) Agencies with their anonymous operatives, eliminate an awkward relationship with the woman who sees your most intimate stains.\par \par \uc2 Coexisting with those who serve you has always been tricky. In Mrs Woolf and the Servants, Alison Light traces the tempestuous relationship between the author and her cook Nellie, who she alternately sacks and begs to return. An unintentionally hilarious 1899 book, The Servant Problem: An Attempt at its Solution, is a treatise on how lazy, feckless maids damage your mental health. \u8220\'20\'1CServants are the pest of my life and yet I cannot do without them," says one mistress. A thought echoed recently in TheWall Street Journal where the Manhattan super-rich, their apartments staffed by cooks and maids, mourned their lost privacy.\par \par \uc2 As Frank Field notes, the trend has been for servants to live out. But the head of a large London nanny agency tells me that this is reversing. Not only the super-rich but any family with a box room is clearing it out because, while a day nanny costs \u163\'00\'A3600 a week, if you provide board\par \par \uc2 it is only \u163\'00\'A3400. And given London\u8217\'20\'19s high rents, this also appeals to the nannies.\par \par \uc2 So are Yorkshire girls still coming down to work in London homes, like my aunts? \u8220\'20\'1CThey come over from Poland or even Brazil," says the agency, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut we rarely get English girls from beyond the Home Counties." Back in Doncaster, every home-help or hospital cleaner I come across is a local person. It\u8217\'20\'19s a fallacy that our young don\u8217\'20\'19t wish to work hard: they just don\u8217\'20\'19t want to do it below stairs.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140222ea2m001cf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Law\par \b \uc2 Couple duped to think they had baby after herbal remedy\b0\par\par\uc2 David Brown   \par \uc2 734 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par 00:01\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 An infertile couple were tricked into believing that the woman had given birth after a doctor prescribed a herbal remedy, a judge has ruled.\par \par \uc2 The British couple fell \u8220\'20\'1Cunder the spell" of a bogus doctor after travelling to Lagos, Nigeria, where the wife was given herbs that mimicked the effects of pregnancy, the High Court was told. They returned to Nigeria nine months later and the woman was given another mixture that made her believe she had given birth. Her husband was even given a fake placenta as part of the charade.\par \par \uc2 The couple paid \u163\'00\'A34,500 for the treatment but when they returned to Britain with their \u8220\'20\'1Cdaughter" they were arrested. They were distraught after DNA tests proved that they were not the parents. The girl has been left as \u8220\'20\'1Ceffectively an orphan" in London, with no prospect of learning who her real parents are and possibly facing a childhood in the care system, the court heard.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Justice Hogg, sitting in the Family Division of the High Court, has cleared the \u8220\'20\'1Cintelligent, educated, hard-working" couple of social workers\u8217\'20\'19 accusations that they were knowing parties to the fraud.\par \par \uc2 The judge said that despite ten years of trying surgery, laser treatment and IVF, the couple had failed to conceive. The father met a friend in 2010 who claimed that his wife had had twins after undergoing \u8220\'20\'1Csome herbal treatment" in Nigeria. The couple travelled to Nigeria in May 2011 where a Dr Cletus Okolo prescribed a course of herbal treatments.\par \par \uc2 On returning to Britain and taking the herbs, the mother noticed her body changing. Her face, arms and abdomen all swelled up. A \u8220\'20\'1Ckindly and well-meaning" local GP was taken in, accepting that she was seven months\u8217\'20\'19 pregnant. The doctor signed off a maternity certificate and the couple travelled back to Nigeria in April 2012.\par \par \uc2 The wife was given a brown liquid to drink before entering what she thought was a delivery room. Mrs Justice Hogg said: \u8220\'20\'1CShe did not experience much pain, which she attributed to the herb she had been given. In due course she felt the baby\u8217\'20\'19s head, and the baby\u8217\'20\'19s body emerging and something sliding against her leg. She was lying on her back with her knees up. She could not see what was happening."\par \par \uc2 The expectant husband waited in the corridor outside and, after few minutes, heard a baby cry. He entered the room to find the baby girl lying on the bed beside his groggy wife. He was given a placenta take away. Dr Okolo wrote: \u8220\'20\'1CTreatment successful, patient delivered of a baby girl. All fees paid. God\u8217\'20\'19s doing".\par \par \uc2 That was the only document that accompanied the birth and, after the couple flew home with the baby, social workers were alerted. The couple were arrested and the baby was taken into police protection. To their \u8220\'20\'1Cconsiderable dismay and shock", DNA testing proved that the girl was not their child. Having waited so long for a baby, the couple could not accept the truth. They insisted that \u8220\'20\'1Cthe combination of spiritual and herbal treatments was so powerful as to be able to change DNA".\par \par \uc2 Social workers from \uc2 Hillingdon council\uc2 , West London, who brought the case, argued that the couple were \u8220\'20\'1Cknowing parties to an elaborate fraud and charade upon the British \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  authorities".\par \par \uc2 Mrs Justice Hogg judge conceded: \u8220\'20\'1CAt first blush, the immediate reaction of the ordinary man on the proverbial Clapham omnibus would no doubt be, \u8216\'20\'18Don\u8217\'20\'19t be daft, it\u8217\'20\'19s a fraud, they knew it\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CDespite their education and intelligence, they are struggling with the result of the DNA test. Having considered all the evidence . . . I am driven to conclude that in some way they allowed themselves to be duped by fraudsters. They so much wanted a baby . . . they allowed themselves to fall under the spell of the herbalists, believing what was said to the mother and acting faithfully upon the instructions given to them."\par \par \uc2 She ordered a further hearing to decide where the girl\u8217\'20\'19s best interests lie.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Justice threatened by political correctness\par \par \uc2 YESTERDAY, solicitor Asha Khan was given a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice.\par \par \uc2 The public interest in knowing that a member of the legal profession had herself tried to undermine the very integrity of the justice system is overwhelming.\par \par \uc2 Yet, disgracefully, the case was almost heard under a shroud of secrecy in the latest example of a court obsessing over political correctness.\par \par \uc2 Khan, a Muslim who was accused of helping her father dodge a speeding fine, had claimed that for 'cultural reasons' she could not speak freely in front of the Press - and, incredibly, Judge Peter Hughes agreed.\par \par \uc2 It was only after the intervention of this newspaper that the judge accepted he had made a mistake and reversed what risked setting a terrible precedent.\par \par \uc2 The Mail is glad that - belatedly - the sacred principle of open and transparent justice was upheld.\par \par \uc2 But doesn't it speak volumes about how the insidious culture of political correctness has infected every limb of the justice system - from the police and \uc2 Crown Prosecution Service\uc2  to the judiciary - that a ban was ever considered acceptable in the first place?\par \par \uc2 Language barrier\par \par \uc2 FIGURES obtained from the Education Department reveal that, in one in every nine schools in England, most pupils now speak English as a second language.\par \par \uc2 The number of children from Eastern Europe has increased from 44,000 to 123,000 in just five years, after Labour deliberately encouraged mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from the ex-Eastern Bloc.\par \par \uc2 And, now restrictions have been lifted on families from Romania and Bulgaria, the total is expected to climb further.\par \par \uc2 We applaud the teachers who are making heroic efforts to educate often hard-working children from overseas who, between them, speak an astonishing 300 languages.\par \par \uc2 But aren't the politicians increasingly expecting our polyglot schools to do an impossible job?\par \par \uc2 What is certain is that the current squabbles at Westminster over how to try to control EU migration, without upsetting Brussels, are comparable to arguing over who should shut the stable door long after the horse bolted.\par \par \uc2 Betrayed to the end\par \par \uc2 THE tragic farce of the Mid-Staffs hospital scandal continues.\par \par \uc2 A year has passed since the Francis report revealed horrific details of inhuman treatment and the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients.\par \par \uc2 Yet still no senior figure has been held to account.\par \par \uc2 NHS\uc2  head \uc2 Sir David Nicholson\uc2  - the Man With No Shame - was allowed to retire at his own leisure on a vast pension. The doctors involved were cleared by the GMC. The one manager who was sacked got \u163\'00\'A3100,000 for unfair dismissal and, most offensively, not a single person has faced a criminal charge.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, a judge was due to sentence the \uc2 NHS\uc2  Trust for breaching health and safety laws over the death of Gillian Astbury, a diabetic who lapsed into a coma after over-worked nurses failed to give her insulin.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, who says no individual criminal charges are possible, decided to adjourn the case.\par \par \uc2 His dilemma is whether to hit the trust with a fine - the only sanction at his disposal - even though taxpayers will foot the bill and patients suffer.\par \par \uc2 Whatever he decides, the victims' families will have been failed by a heartless bureaucratic system that allowed hundreds of patients to die terrible deaths.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140221ea2m00065\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 DRINK, DRUGS AND THE BRITS 'ROLE MODELS'\b0\par\par\uc2 BY AMANDA PLATELL   \par \uc2 1,532 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Coverage of our most prestigious pop music awards, the Brits, was beamed across the world on TV this week. Our equivalent of the Grammys in the U.S. offered a showcase of one of Britain's big export industries.\par \par \uc2 And what a shameful show they put on. What we were served up was not a celebration of the best in music but a sordid and self-indulgent orgy of booze and drugs.\par \par \uc2 No wonder former heroin addict Boy George described it as a 'chorus of snorting drugs'.\par \par \uc2 For my part, I asked myself whether the queues for the loos were simply the result of the vast amount of free alcohol on offer or the desire to take cocaine there.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most yobbishly behaved was Alex Turner, who is lead singer of the Arctic Monkeys.\par \par \uc2 He appeared almost paralytically drunk when he tried to give his acceptance speech after winning two awards, for Best British Group and Album of the Year.\par \par \uc2 Hosting this unseemly bacchanalia was cheeky-chappy actor James Corden. Typically, he graced the occasion with a full-on kiss on the lips with Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw as well as making bad-taste jokes about flood victims and gay rape.\par \par \uc2 Is it any surprise that nearly two million fewer viewers watched this debauchery than tuned into last year's Brits ceremony?\par \par \uc2 But perhaps the most disturbing aspect was the behaviour of the female stars. They don't seem to realise that for many young, impressionable girls who envy their fabulous frocks, fame and big fortunes, they are role\u160\'00\'A0models.\par \par \uc2 Kate Moss \u8212\'20\'14 unrepentant after photographs a few years ago that seemed to show her snorting cocaine \u8212\'20\'14 strutted onto the stage to collect an award on behalf of Best British Male David Bowie.\par \par \uc2 Then she joined Best British Female Ellie Goulding (who staggered legless into the back of a taxi while making a V-sign) to go on elsewhere for some more hard partying.\par \par \uc2 This is the same Miss Goulding who is treated as part of the New Establishment, having been invited to sing at the wedding reception of Prince William and \uc2 Kate Middleton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Is it any wonder that countless towns across Britain are filled every weekend with girls out of their minds on drink and drugs who think it cool to ape their pop heroines?\par \par \uc2 * The Baftas had their lowest ever TV ratings \u8212\'20\'14 4.6 million \u8212\'20\'14 thanks to the interminably boring and blundering host Stephen Fry. He fluffed his lines and made self-serving jokes that few outside of London's luvvieland could understand. If he's considered such a national treasure, perhaps he should be consigned to a museum?\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 For many Christians, it is deeply troubling to see church leaders queuing up to blame welfare 'cuts' for the rise in the use of food banks.\par \par \uc2 Of course, there are people who fall upon hard times and need food banks, but the churchmen's ill-informed comments appear to be a co-ordinated political attack.\par \par \uc2 Even the Trussell Trust charity, run by a Labour Party member, which provided 738,000 people with food last year, has conceded that only 15 per cent were in need as a result of cuts in their benefits.\par \par \uc2 The truth is that Britain offers some of the most generous state welfare in the world, and annual spending is due to increase in the current Parliament, from \u163\'00\'A3200bn to \u163\'00\'A3206bn.\par \par \uc2 I'm glad, though, that we are having this debate. For we should never forget it is those people in work who pay tax and fund the cost of those who don't. Indeed, there is something morally wrong with a system in which some hard-working people live on less money than some on benefits.\par \par \uc2 This is the argument being put forward by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith in his drive to tackle the insidious culture of welfare dependency by guaranteeing that work always pays. Indeed, this is exactly the kind of moral behaviour our church leaders should be supporting.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Labour grandees \uc2 Patricia Hewitt\uc2 , \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2  and her husband Jack Dromey refuse to apologise or explain their support of a notorious paedophile group in the Seventies. As the many court cases following the Jimmy Savile inquiry have proved, time is not, nor should be, a barrier to the investigation of child abuse.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The eternally youthful actress \uc2 Sharon Stone\uc2 , 55, tells us that the art of ageing well is not to succumb to a face-lift. She says we should all embrace the sensuality of our 'imperfections'. I trust she hasn't secretly had more work done to herself than was carried out during the restoration of the Sistine Chapel.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Hollie Gazzard, 20, was stabbed to death in her hairdressing salon by a man thought to have been her ex-boyfriend. Paramedics tried desperately to save her, but she died in their arms. Most shockingly, police had to ask bystanders who filmed her death on their mobiles not to post the footage online. What sort of society are we when people film such a thing, let alone 'share' it online?\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 In the same week we learned of the truly horrific story of a six-day-old baby being savaged to death by a dog bought in the local pub, there was another tale to restore our faith in man's best friend.\par \par \uc2 Bull terrier Charlie was so distraught when his diabetic owner John Hockaday collapsed that he howled until John's son heard the noise and called an ambulance. Just five minutes longer and John would have died.\par \par \uc2 Yes, dogs can be dangerous and should never be left alone with a baby, but how many of us owe much of our happiness to a pet such as Charlie?\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 One of the co-founders of the mobile messaging service WhatsApp, which \uc2 Facebook\uc2  bought for \u163\'00\'A311.4 billion this week, was an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  to the U.S. from the Communist Soviet Union.\par \par \uc2 At first, \uc2 Jan Koum\uc2  survived by sweeping floors. This is an object lesson for all those British youngsters who say menial jobs are beneath them.\par \par \uc2 I bet many of the workaholic Eastern Europeans who are willing to start off by doing the most unpleasant jobs will become the billionaire entrepreneurs of the\u160\'00\'A0future.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 * Conscious that girls are reluctant to take part in sport for fear of getting sweaty and looking 'unfeminine', sports minister Helen Grant says they should be encouraged to take up more fashionable activities \u8212\'20\'14 such as cheerleading and roller-skating.\par \par \uc2 What an idiotic suggestion! Our latest sporting successes include the bronze-winning female Olympic curling team, captained by Eve Muirhead (pictured).\par \par \uc2 With their perfectly manicured nails and more eyeliner than the Middletons, they lost out on silver after a rogue hair slowed the path of one stone. I fear it fell out of one of their hair extensions.\par \par \uc2 * Britain's biggest energy supplier warns that 'the lights could go out' in 2016 if Labour wins the next election and Ed Miliband keeps his promise to freeze fuel prices.\par \par \uc2 It gives a whole new meaning to the famous headline in The Sun before the 1992 election: 'Will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights?'\par \par \uc2 If Red Ed wins, there won't be any lights to turn off.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 As the new champion of elephant conservation (despite his family's love of hunting other wildlife), Prince William says that he would like all the ivory in the Royal Family's collections to be destroyed.\par \par \uc2 It's a well-meaning gesture, but as experts pointed out, the idea is 'bonkers'. Not only would it risk fuelling the illegal trade in ivory (the less ivory there is, the greater the value to poachers of the tusks of the elephants that remain), but the royal ivory is not even his to destroy. The Royal Collection is held in trust for the nation.\par \par \uc2 With such poor judgment, I wasn't surprised that the Prince oafishly high-fived a rapper at last week's Baftas.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 LECTURING CHURCHMEN SHOULD EAT THEIR WORDS\par \par \uc2 Having anchored the BBC's TV coverage of eight general elections, David Dimbleby will work on his last next year. Even his decision to have a trendy scorpion tattoo has not enabled him to fight off the march of time. As with distinguished female TV presenters, there's always someone younger waiting to take over.\par \par \uc2 Dimbleby, 75, is lucky, however. Lugubrious Huw Edwards, who hosted the BBC's controversial coverage of the Diamond Jubilee, is 23 years his junior but manages to look older than him.\par \par \uc2 \u163\'00\'A3500K FOR A SORE KNEE?\par \par \uc2 A woman has won more than \u163\'00\'A3500,000 in compensation after having to wait 17 minutes for an ambulance after dislocating her knee.\par \par \uc2 The money was paid out because she was said to be suffering from 'post- traumatic stress disorder'.\par \par \uc2 Compare her experience with that of our soldiers who have returned from Afghanistan or Iraq with terrible injuries and debilitating stress, having witnessed unimaginable atrocities in battle.\par \par \uc2 A dislocated knee?\par \par \uc2 These Services men and women, some of them multiple amputees, can but dream of a half-a- million-pound pay-out.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140221ea2m00066\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 MINISTERS WHO PUT THEIR JOBS BEFORE THEIR COUNTRY\b0\par\par\uc2 BY SIMON HEFFER   \par \uc2 1,290 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 43\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 As PART of a deeply disturbing healthcare rationing policy, it emerged this week that ministers want to make younger people a higher priority for treatment than the elderly because they are deemed more economically useful to society.\par \par \uc2 It is no surprise that the news was greeted by widespread outrage. But the fact is that it is estimated the number of over-80s in Britain will double in the next 25 years.\par \par \uc2 If the \uc2 NHS\uc2  has a problem now with an ageing population, just imagine how bad it will become in the future.\par \par \uc2 The tragedy is that, like ostriches, politicians are putting their heads in the sand and ignoring the issue. Indeed, there is a similar refusal to face up to a host of other potential crises.\par \par \uc2 This shameful absence of strategic thinking across Whitehall includes such crucial areas as pensions, transport, energy and defence policies.\par \par \uc2 'You know why we duck out of tackling these big issues?' a senior Tory told me this week. 'It's because the problems are so huge that if we admitted their scale, people would panic and we would never be re-elected.'\par \par \uc2 But it is the key responsibility of every government to address the country's needs in 20 years' time \u8212\'20\'14 and not just tackle issues of the day.\par \par \uc2 Of course, ministers claim they are thinking strategically \u8212\'20\'14 citing for example plans for a new high-speed railway between London and the North of England.\par \par \uc2 But I am yet to be convinced that this fatuous project would bring enough benefits to justify the estimated \u163\'00\'A370 billion cost.\par \par \uc2 Ministers have certainly been reluctant to address our future energy needs, simply relying on risibly inadequate wind turbines and solar panels rather than investing in a new generation of nuclear reactors.\par \par \uc2 And although there has been a major inquiry into the care of the elderly, its conclusions, too, have been kicked into the long grass.\par \par \uc2 There are countless other examples of how politicians are abjectly failing to prepare for the future.\par \par \uc2 Our road system is utterly unsatisfactory. And, having allowed uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  for years, we have no sensible housing policy \u8212\'20\'14 simply letting the Home Counties be concreted over while parts of the North become wastelands.\par \par \uc2 Admittedly, Michael Gove's vision for education is admirably long-term, but it is vulnerable to being destroyed by a capricious successor as education secretary. However, I see no evidence of serious thought being given to the future of our universities. This is because of the idiotic decision for them to be put under the malign control of Vince Cable's business department.\par \par \uc2 Decisions, too, are being fudged on London's airport capacity, with potentially devastating consequences for the country's future economic health.\par \par \uc2 If Amsterdam, Paris or Frankfurt replace Heathrow as Europe's main air hub, Britain risks losing billions of pounds every year.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the catastrophic running down of our Armed Forces \u8212\'20\'14 with money diverted to help China fund its space programme \u8212\'20\'14 leaves us vulnerable to aggressive states.\par \par \uc2 Putting their collective head in the sand should not be an option for politicians.\par \par \uc2 One answer would be to ensure there is a minister in every department charged with thinking solely about the country's future needs.\par \par \uc2 Sadly, though, it is a truism of politics that ministers put their own survival at Westminster before their efforts to address their country's long-term needs.\par \par \uc2 This is a disgraceful dereliction of duty. For one thing is certain: Britain will face many more life-or-death crises in the coming years than slow trains, traffic gridlock and short-term power black-outs.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 The EU has ordered sanctions against senior Ukrainian politicians in an attempt to stop the violence and prevent a civil war in that benighted nation. Yet this is mere tokenism. The only effective sanctions would be against the Kiev regime's puppet-masters in Moscow. We should freeze Russian assets and forbid travel in the EU by \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  and his henchmen. London has a key role to play since I'm convinced that many high-end property sales are being paid for with money laundered by Russian gangsters (some of them close personal friends of Putin).\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg, desperate to cling to office beyond the next election, is cynically wooing Labour by saying the party has 'changed' since 2010 and hints he could do a deal with Ed Miliband.\par \par \uc2 The idea of a Labour government might frighten many, but I fear it would cause less damage to Britain than a Lib/Lab coalition. My reasoning? However much Miliband has moved Labour leftwards, it's still not as Left-wing as the Lib Dems.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 It's most unwise of Scottish First Minister \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  and his finance minister, John Swinney, to threaten that an independent Scotland would default on its share of the national debt in retaliation for being excluded from a currency union with England. Such a default would cause the financial markets, from which Scotland would need to borrow huge sums, unfairly to charge other countries a huge premium on their loans.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Forgive me if I don't yet join the cult that worships \uc2 Mark Carney\uc2 , the Governor of the Bank of England, as the saviour of our economy.\par \par \uc2 Mr Carney has already been wrong-footed by having to retreat from a plan for the Bank to raise interest rates in 2016 when he predicted that unemployment levels would fall to 7 per cent of the workforce. For the figure has almost reached that level now.\par \par \uc2 Also, Mr Carney claimed it was not in his power to control rocketing house prices, whose bubble will eventually burst. But he can \u8212\'20\'14 by raising interest rates.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 The former head of Scotland Yard's anti-paedophile unit suggests an apology is due from Labour politicians \uc2 Patricia Hewitt\uc2 , \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2  and Jack Dromey for their 'mistake' in associating the \uc2 National Council for Civil Liberties\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 for which they once worked \u8212\'20\'14 with the campaign to legalise paedophilia. Meanwhile, a Tory MP has announced plans to resign after it was revealed he had attended a Nazi-themed stag party.\par \par \uc2 Most people would argue that encouraging child molesters is a much, much more serious 'mistake' than attending a stupid and offensive party.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 There is, rightly, shock that more than 200 pregnant British women soldiers have been repatriated from Iraq or Afghanistan. The warnings from senior officers that women in the front line would cause discipline problems have been proved terrifyingly right. But surely even the most diehard feminist can't think it is a mark of a civilised country to send pregnant women to face bullets and land-mines?\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Culture Secretary Maria Miller (pictured) is widely regarded as ineffectual, clinging to her job only because of \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's embarrassing shortage of women on his front bench.\par \par \uc2 She is also embarrassed by an expenses irregularity in which she claimed \u163\'00\'A390,000 for a house in which her parents were living.\par \par \uc2 Some MPs have gone to jail for less. There are other Tories who would make superb Culture Secretaries \u8212\'20\'14 even if they do happen to be men.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Of course ministers deserve a certain amount of time off. But Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey was most foolish to remain on paternity leave (that very modern concept) when 100,000 homes were left without power after the recent storms. This was typical Lib Dem behaviour. For Davey's boss, Nick Clegg, regularly goes home early to help his formidable wife look after their children. I have a suggestion: since the Coalition has run out of legislative steam, why doesn't every minister go on permanent leave while a general election is called? The country would be much better off.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140221ea2m0006b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 ENGLISH IS SECOND LANGUAGE IN ONE IN NINE SCHOOLS\b0\par\par\uc2 BY ANDREW LEVY   \par \uc2 777 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 THE influx of migrants from Eastern Europe has fuelled a huge rise in the number of schoolchildren who do not speak English as a first language.\par \par \uc2 In five years between 2008 and 2013 the number of Eastern European pupils who don't speak English at home almost tripled from just over 44,000 to more than 123,000.\par \par \uc2 Astonishingly, one in nine English schools now has a majority of pupils who do not speak English as a first language. The official figures lay bare the enormous strain mass migration has placed on our schools.\par \par \uc2 The number of pupils who speak Romanian as a first language has seen the steepest increase - rising 527 per cent in five years. The number using Bulgarian at home has risen by 255 per cent.\par \par \uc2 However, the Education Department figures - obtained by the Daily Mail under Freedom of Information laws - only cover the five years before labour market restrictions on both countries were lifted last month, meaning the trend looks set to continue.\par \par \uc2 Schools are already struggling to cope with the demand for places, with some having to teach pupils in temporary classrooms.\par \par \uc2 Official estimates suggest that more than one million extra places will be needed in Britain over the next decade, which will bring the total required to eight million by 2022, the highest for 40 years.\par \par \uc2 The Government is already having to spend \u163\'00\'A35billion by 2015 on increasing the number of places to help ease the crisis.\par \par \uc2 Concerns have also been raised about the impact of the rising numbers on other services, including the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and social housing.\par \par \uc2 Educating children who do not speak English as their mother tongue also puts a huge financial strain on schools. The cost of educating a non-native speaker has been estimated at up to \u163\'00\'A330,000 a year, compared to around \u163\'00\'A35,000 for other pupils, because of the need for intensive classroom assistance.\par \par \uc2 Anastasia De Waal, of think-tank Civitas, warned the strain on resources was damaging the education of both English children and those from recent migrant families.\par \par \uc2 'In too many cases our schools are simply not set up to accommodate very high proportions of children who start school without fluent English,' she said. 'Those who lose out most in this scenario are these very pupils, as they don't receive adequate opportunities to develop their English language skills and are therefore at risk of going through the education system at a significant disadvantage. In turn, in an environment where teachers are struggling to cope because they are not given the time and facilities they need to strengthen language, those pupils for whom English is their first language can also suffer educationally and by default be neglected.'\par \par \uc2 Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real English, said non-English speaking \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  children 'often bring an excellent work ethic to the classroom'.\par \par \uc2 But he said: 'It means a lot of teacher time has to be spent addressing language issues.' The total number of pupils whose second language is English went up by a fifth to 1.1million between January 2008 and January 2013.\par \par \uc2 Nine of the ten fastest-growing foreign first languages are from Eastern Europe - the exception being the southern Indian language of Malayalam.\par \par \uc2 The second highest increase in pupils with English as a second language was among Latvians, on 414 per cent, followed by Hungarians, with 359 per cent. In both cases exact numbers were not recorded initially as they were below 1,000 - suggesting the percentage increase could be even higher.\par \par \uc2 Rising demand for school places has been caused by a growing birthrate, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and the fact that ever fewer middle-class families can afford private education.\par \par \uc2 But as well as the number of families migrating to Britain, further pressure is created by the high birthrate among those families once they have moved, the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  has said.\par \par \uc2 Romanian women on average have 2.93 children here compared to 1.25 at home. British women average 1.84 children.\par \par \uc2 Employment figures on Wednesday showed the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK rose by 40 per cent last year to 144,000.\par \par \uc2 Last year five primary schools were identified as not having a single pupil whose mother tongue is English. There were also 240 schools where at least 90 per cent of children grew up learning another language.\par \par \uc2 The number of languages and dialects spoken in primary and secondary schools is now 309, ranging from Afrikaans and Amharic, from Ethiopia, to Shqip, from Albania and Kosovo, and Zulu.\par \par \uc2 Comment - Page 18\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140221ea2m0006l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 BRITISH COUPLE CONNED INTO BELIEVING NIGERIAN INFANT WAS THEIR OWN; HERBAL REMEDIES CONVINCED 'MOTHER' SHE WAS PREGNANT\b0\par\par\uc2 BY DAILY MAIL REPORTER   \par \uc2 947 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A BRITISH couple 'fell under the spell' of Nigerian fraudsters who gave the woman herbal remedies and tricked her into thinking she had given birth, the High Court heard.\par \par \uc2 The court was told how the husband and wife still cannot accept the baby girl they brought home from Nigeria two years ago is not their own - despite DNA tests proving they are not the natural parents.\par \par \uc2 Social workers arrested the couple after they returned to the UK, accusing them of being knowing parties in the fraud.\par \par \uc2 The court heard how the little girl is now 'effectively an orphan' with no prospect of ever learning who her real parents are - and could faces growing up in the British care system.\par \par \uc2 Now a judge has cleared the 'intelligent, educated, hard working' couple of any involvement in the scam, possibly paving the way for her to be returned to them. Family judge Mary Hogg told the court how for ten years the couple, who cannot be named, tried surgery, laser treatment and IVF to start a family - but to no avail. Then in 2010 the husband ran into a university friend who told him of a couple who had had twins after 'some herbal treatment' in Nigeria.\par \par \uc2 The desperate couple decided to travel to Africa, where they were prescribed a course of herbal remedies by a man calling himself Dr Cletus Okolo.\par \par \uc2 After taking the herbs and returning to Britain, the woman's face, arms and abdomen swelled as if she was pregnant. Even a 'kindly and well-meaning' local GP accepted she was seven months' pregnant, and signed off a maternity certificate.\par \par \uc2 The couple then returned to Nigeria for further treatment.\par \par \uc2 At a clinic near the capital Lagos, they handed over \u163\'00\'A34,500 and the woman was given a brown liquid to drink before entering what she thought was a delivery room.\par \par \uc2 The man waited in the corridor outside and, after few minutes, he heard a baby cry. He entered the room to find the baby girl - referred to in court only as 'A' - lying on the bed beside his groggy wife.\par \par \uc2 He was duped into believing he had seen the umbilical cord cut and was given a placenta in a plastic bag. After pocketing the couple's money, Dr Okolo wrote: 'Treatment successful, patient delivered of a baby girl. All fees paid. God's doing', which was the sole document that accompanied the birth.\par \par \uc2 After returning home to the UK they were arrested and A was taken into police protection.\par \par \uc2 To the couple's 'considerable dismay and shock', DNA tests proved that the girl was not their child.\par \par \uc2 Having waited so long for a baby, the couple simply could not accept the truth, the court heard. Far from seeing themselves as victims, they insisted that 'the combination of spiritual and herbal treatments was so powerful as to be able to change DNA'.\par \par \uc2 But Mrs Justice Hogg said: 'There is no evidence before me to say that the result of the DNA testing was wrong or likely to be wrong. I do not accept the explanation of the parents.\par \par \uc2 'On that basis I have to accept the validity of the results and find that the baby is not the biological child of the putative parents.'\par \par \uc2 Social workers in the \uc2 London Borough of Hillingdon\uc2 , as well as the child's court-appointed guardian, argued that the couple were 'knowing parties to an elaborate fraud and charade upon the British \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  authorities and now parties to an attempted fraud on the court'.\par \par \uc2 They claimed the couple's account of the birth was 'littered with inconsistency' and implausibly embellished.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Justice Hogg conceded: 'At first blush, the immediate reaction of the ordinary man on the proverbial Clapham omnibus would no doubt be, "Don't be daft, its a fraud, they knew it".'\par \par \uc2 However, noting the 'enormous difficulty' the couple had had in conceiving a child, Mrs Justice Hogg took them at their word when they said they would 'never seek to buy a baby'.\par \par \uc2 She added: 'Despite their education and intelligence, they are struggling with the result of the DNA test. Both of them say they still believe that A is their natural child.\par \par \uc2 'In the end, having considered all the evidence... I am driven to conclude that in some way they allowed themselves to be duped by fraudsters.\par \par \uc2 'They so much wanted a baby... they allowed themselves to fall under the spell of the herbalists, believing what was said to the mother and acting faithfully upon the instructions given to them.\par \par \uc2 'Contrary to the submissions of the local authority and guardian I do not find that the parents were wilfully and knowingly involved with or parties to a wrongful removal of A from her mother, or that they cynically "bought" a baby.'\par \par \uc2 The judge concluded: 'What is clear to me, having found that she is not their biological child but the child of another mother and father, and having been removed from her mother very soon after her birth, is that A certainly is the victim of wrongdoing and illegality, and very possibly her mother as well.\par \par \uc2 'The fact remains that A is effectively an orphan. There is no one in this country who has parental responsibility for her and no information as to her birth, parentage, or background.'\par \par \uc2 Mrs Justice Hogg ordered a further hearing to decide where A's best interests lie. Her finding that the couple were innocent dupes could improve their chances of persuading the court that A should be returned to them.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140221ea2m00078\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 GILLIAN REYNOLDS PICK OF THE WEEK\par \par \uc2 SATURDAY\par \par \uc2 When Garry Met Tony Radio 4, 10.30am\par \par \uc2 You'll know Garry Richardson's voice as a sports presenter on Radios 4 and 5 Live but here's where he discloses an unfulfilled ambition. For years he's wanted to sing, Sinatra\u8211\'20\'13style, with a big band. Two years ago, he challenged Radio 4's Saturday Live to find him one. Tony Douglas, a former bandmaster now running the amateur big band at London's Morley College, was listening and invited Garry to join them for a bit of training. So he did, while also getting a few tips from singer Kurt Ellings, big\u8211\'20\'13band fan Michael Parkinson and singer Buddy Greco before making his debut at London's Spice of Life Jazz club. Whatever next? Eight bar musical intros to his Sunday morning Sportsweek?\par \par \uc2 Saturday Drama: Classic Chandler \u8211\'20\'13 The Lady in the Lake (Radio 4, 2.30pm) repeats the smooth performance of Toby Stephens as Raymond Chandler's private\u8211\'20\'13eye\u8211\'20\'13witha\u8211\'20\'13conscience Philip Marlowe.\par \par \uc2 There's original radio drama on Radio 4 Extra at 4.00pm, Andrew Rissik's brilliant 1998 trilogy Troy. Julian Glover heads an allstar cast as King Priam, Michael Sheen as Paris, Geraldine Somerville as Helen and Paul Scofield as Hermes.\par \par \uc2 The Craig Charles Funk and Soul Show (6 Music, 6.00pm) has a session and masterclass from George Clinton.\par \par \uc2 Gerry Mulligan\uc2  fans should stay up for Geoffrey Smith's Jazz (Radio 3, midnight), where those peerless sounds haven't aged a day.\par \par \uc2 SUNDAY\par \par \uc2 Classic Serial: Pride and Prejudice\par \par \uc2 Radio 4, 3.00pm\par \par \uc2 The Classic Serial suspends its Barchester season for a new, three\u8211\'20\'13part adaptation of Jane Austen's best\u8211\'20\'13known novel. Pippa Nixon plays Elizabeth Bennet, eldest of five daughters, apple of her father's eye (he's played by David Troughton, now Tony in The Archers), with Samantha Spiro as her chatterbox mother and Jamie Parker as Mr Darcy.\par \par \uc2 Sunday Feature: Eileen Gray: The Missing Heart of Design (Radio 3, 6.45pm) considers a real\u8211\'20\'13life heroine, the Irish\u8211\'20\'13born architect and designer Eileen Gray (1878\u8211\'20\'131976), who contested Le Corbusier's dictum that a house is "a machine for living" with the assertion that it's "a place for the soul to roam". Actress and writer Fiona Shaw looks at Gray's work, assesses its place in modernist design and, with novelist Colm T\u243\'00\'F3ib\u237\'00\'EDn, asks why Ireland seems to forget some of its greatest creative talents?\par \par \uc2 Private Passions (Radio 3, noon) has Conservative MP Kwasi Kwarteng as Michael Berkeley's guest. The son of Ghanain \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who came to the UK in the Sixties, Kwarteng was elected to represent Spelthorne, Surrey, in 2010. He picks Wagner, Gilbert and Sullivan, Chopin, Schubert, Haydn, Smokey Robinson and John Gielgud reading Shelley's Ozymandias. But he also longs for a piano on which to play Scott Joplin.\par \par \uc2 Gerald Scarfe is the guest on Desert Island Discs Revisited (R4 Extra, 10.00am) talking to Sue Lawley (back in 1989) about his isolated childhood, why his cartoons seem aggressive and why he took to animation.\par \par \uc2 The Mysterious Death of Jane Austen\par \par \uc2 Radio 4, 10. 45am\par \par \uc2 Lindsay Ashford's novel (adapted for radio by Eileen Horne and Andrew Davies), on why Jane Austen died aged 41. Was it really from natural causes? Twenty\u8211\'20\'13six years after Austen's death Anne Sharp (Ruth Gemmell), former governess to the Austens and Jane's close friend, decides to tell her story. It's one of family intrigues, secrets and forbidden loves. Maybe even murder. Elaine Cassidy plays Jane.\par \par \uc2 Out of the Ordinary (Radio 4, 11.00am) is an eye\u8211\'20\'13opener. Jolyon Jenkins, tireless seeker of odd threads in the national tapestry, introduces us to the London Seduction Society. Men don't have to be good\u8211\'20\'13looking to succeed, it seems, they just need to know how women think. Jenkins goes out on the prowl with some of the society's members, observes as four unconfident, inexperienced men are coached by experts on pick\u8211\'20\'13ups.\par \par \uc2 The Complete Ripley: The Talented Mr Ripley (Radio 4 Extra, 1.00pm) brings us Patricia Highsmith's ultimate deceiver in the first of five hour\u8211\'20\'13long dramas. Ian Hart stars as Tom Ripley, identity thief, ruthless, hedonistic, conscience\u8211\'20\'13free; a haunting anti\u8211\'20\'13hero. First heard on Radio 4 in 2009, this is the work of producer Claire Grove, posthumously awarded the Outstanding Achievement Award at this year's \uc2 BBC\uc2  Audio Drama Awards.\par \par \uc2 World War One at Home (all \uc2 BBC\uc2  local and regional stations, 8.15am) brings stories from real life as lived away from the front, co\u8211\'20\'13produced with the \uc2 Imperial War Museum\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 TUESDAY\par \par \uc2 Miranda Hart's Joke Shop Radio 4 Extra, 11.30pm\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Danny Cohen\uc2 , the \uc2 BBC\uc2 's director of television, announced a couple of weeks ago that every single panel show will now include a compulsory woman he immediately ignited a bonfire of debate on whether there are enough funny women to go round. Nick Ferrari on LBC (now a national radio station, albeit a digital one) said he didn't find Miranda Hart funny. "She's tall and falls over," he said. "That doesn't make me laugh." I know he's a reader so I advise him to listen to this repeat of the 2008 Radio 2 series that turned into the hit TV comedy Miranda and won awards in armfuls. It may, of course, confirm his view that Ms Hart's talents are not in the Joan Rivers, Joyce Grenfell, Beatrice Lillie or even Victoria Wood class. But at least he'll have done a bit more homework.\par \par \uc2 Lauren Laverne\uc2  (6 Music, 10.00am) welcomes singer\u8211\'20\'13songwriter Rufus Wainwright (son of Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III) as her studio guest. He has a new album, Vibrate, out and a lot to talk about too: a dip into opera, Shakespeare's sonnets, his work for films, his colourful life, his family. That'll be handy as he's also the guest of Radio 2's Jo Whiley (8.00pm).\par \par \uc2 Free Thinking (Radio 3, 10.00pm) takes a new stage musical, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (adapted from the 1988 film), as a peg for Samira Ahmed to discuss the appeal of scoundrels in fiction.\par \par \uc2 WEDNESDAY\par \par \uc2 The Long March Radio 4, 11.00am\par \par \uc2 Edward Stourton on the founding event of modern China, the Long March of October 1934 when Mao Zedong and 86,000 men and women of his Red Army began an epic journey in Jiangxi province, battling their way across 8,000 miles of rivers and plains to escape Chiang Kai\u8211\'20\'13Shek's Nationalists. It took a year and only a few thousand made it all the way. Mao called it a "manifesto" of what it would take to build a new China. In this three\u8211\'20\'13part series Stourton shows how, in a way, that march has never ended, why it has been endlessly retold in speeches, books and films to meet China's changes. And he meets a 98\u8211\'20\'13year\u8211\'20\'13old veteran who survived it all.\par \par \uc2 Access All Areas: Best and Worst (Radio 1 and 1 Xtra, 9.00pm) takes the best (and worst) moments from this month's "takeover" of Radio 1 by listeners. This is what happened when the \uc2 BBC\uc2  said, "Come in and do what you like" \u8211\'20\'13 music, rants and all. Bet Radio 3 wouldn't try this.\par \par \uc2 Comedy Club: On the Town with The League of Gentlemen (Radio 4 Extra, 11.00pm) goes back to before Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith, et al, were famous when, back in 1997, \uc2 BBC\uc2  radio comedy took a chance on a group that was the talk of the club circuit and gave them their own series. It gave me, I must admit, the creeps to such an extent that it took me ages to warm to Gatiss as an accomplished writer and actor. But that took him time (and harder work than mine) too.\par \par \uc2 THURSDAY\par \par \uc2 Afternoon Drama: Pixie Juice Radio 4, 2.15pm\par \par \uc2 Indira Varma plays Anya in Ed Harris's comedy about insight, magic and its limits. She's struggling to run her father's tattoo parlour while coping with his failing eyesight. One night a tiny creature with magical powers drops in. Now, as all fans of fairy tales know, this could be the upturn in her fortunes she longed for yet; on the other hand, it's likely to come with conditions. But she doesn't really believe that kind of thing. Or does she?\par \par \uc2 Tonight's Radio 3 Live in Concert (7.30pm) comes from the City Halls in Glasgow, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Andrew Manze. The programme opens with Aaron Copland's incidental music for Irwin Shaw's play, A Quiet City. The play is largely forgotten but Copland's atmospheric score lives on.\par \par \uc2 In the interval Scottish writer Louise Welsh performs her new work, written in response to this music, exploring the city at night when, even amid today's glittering high rises, things change.\par \par \uc2 On Radio 4, back in 2002, Vicky Pollard, Matt Lucas's "yeah but, no but" school girl, and Sebastian Love, David Walliams's infatuated aide to a particularly smooth prime minister, were both born. Hear them and many another vivid creation on the first of four re\u8211\'20\'13runs of Little Britain (Radio 4 Extra, 11.30pm). It goes to show that when the announcer says "the home of radio comedy" at the end of some unfunny Radio 4 halfhour (6.30pm), it's not always just an empty promise.\par \par \uc2 FRIDAY\par \par \uc2 International One\u8211\'20\'13Day Cricket: West Indies v England\par \par \uc2 Radio 4 LW and Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, 1.15pm\par \par \uc2 Live ball\u8211\'20\'13by\u8211\'20\'13ball commentary from the first one\u8211\'20\'13day international. Now, considering the recent wretched state of West Indies cricket and the dire form of England on the Australia tour, not to mention the great Kevin Pietersen sacking furore (which occupied 5 Live's morning phone\u8211\'20\'13in for an enraged hour three weeks ago), this match should prove specially interesting.\par \par \uc2 Otherwise, today's big events are all musical. 6 Music begins its first Music Festival and will occupy, every sequence beforehand, from Sean Keaveny at 5.00am, throughout the day. It actually opens at the Victoria Warehouse in Manchester at 7.00pm. Live performers include Damon Albarn, Midlake, Kelis, The Horrors, Drenge and Jimi Goodwin. There are two stages, plus a Talking Heads room (for spoken\u8211\'20\'13word performances), a picture gallery, plus stuff from the archive of the \uc2 BBC\uc2 's (now disbanded) Radiophonic Workshop. Just think: if the \uc2 BBC\uc2  had given up on 6 Music before it eventually found its feet or after its impulse to chop it altogether three years ago\u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Radio 1 wraps up its "Takeover" month with the Access All Areas Closing Party at 7.00pm. Pete Tong, Annie Nightingale, Rob da Bank, et al, will delight clubbers for four hours.\par \par \uc2 As the Oscars loom Friday Night Is Music Night (Radio 2, 8.00pm) has Film 2014's Danny Leigh compering a bill of Oscar\u8211\'20\'13winning themes.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140222ea2m0009v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

He points out that in 1505, San Juan became the first city now in US territory to be settled by Europeans. Nowadays, the former Spanish colonies in Puerto Rico, Florida and the southwest have more meaning for electoral politics than the Mayflower. Even fictional Hispano-American characters such as Zorro and the Cisco Kid, who battled gringos in defence of poor Californios, are now used to reinforce America's heroic character. The Hispanic history of America confirms the capacity of Americans to construct a cultural unity founded in diversity.\par \par \uc2 The Gap: The Science of What Separates Us from Other Animals\par \par \uc2 by Thomas Suddendorf\par \par \uc2 Basic Books, 358pp \u163\'00\'A319.99 \u163\'00\'A317.99 e-book \u163\'00\'A319.99\par \par \uc2 Humpback whales sing songs they learn from each other. The good news is that the information content of the songs is as simple as a pop lyric. The bad news is that there is no conversation beyond basic mateattraction. Whales, like other animals, are intelligent in their own way; just not in our way. Suddendorf, a psychologist, reinforces the point that it is the human capacity to articulate and develop language that distinguishes us from animals. Our success as a dominant species, he says, has depended on our ability to imagine and communicate. But he goes further, suggesting that the gap between humans and animals is widening, not because we are becoming smarter but because we are killing off our closest intelligent animal relatives. Suddendorf brilliantly fills in the gap with telling detail and acute analysis.\par \par \uc2 Erotic exchanges: The World of Elite Prostitution in 18th-Century Paris\par \par \uc2 by Nina Kushner\par \par \uc2 Cornell University Press, 296pp, \u163\'00\'A322.95 \u163\'00\'A322.95\par \par \uc2 The careers of the great French courtesans (les grandes horizontales) of the 19th century are well known: less so are the lives of the kept women of mid-18th-century Paris, les dames entretenues, famous for their glamour and beauty. The dossiers of 550 women under surveillance by a Paris police unit from 1747 to 1771 are the basis of Nina Kushner's inquiry. Men of the elites gained status and a reputation for virility from their liaisons with professional mistresses, who provided sex, company and an escape from arranged marriages. Sex workers have rarely had a better reputation, though the career of a certain Mlle Dalli\u232\'00\'E8re resembled a fast-moving Feydeau French farce. Kushner paints an alluring, amusingly anecdotal picture of a Parisian culture in love and at ease with itself.\par \par \uc2 Iain Finlayson\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140222ea2m000fz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

Expectations of a historic confrontation over the party's future fizzled out when Len McCluskey of the powerful Unite public sector union and the rest of the brothers accepted the Labour leader's proposed changes to the party's rulebook with little more than a bit of griping.\par \par \uc2 Once again Mr Miliband has opted for a fudge rather than the fight that could have been a defining moment for his leadership.\par \par \uc2 Yet while civil war with his union paymasters has been avoided I understand that he is facing a revolt within his Shadow Cabinet that is threatening to be far more damaging.\par \par \uc2 Labour sources say a majority of the Labour leader's team are now convinced he is making a monumental blunder by refusing to match Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's pledge of an in\u8211\'20\'13out referendum on Britain's membership of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And many in Labour despair that Miliband and Shadow Foreign Secretary \uc2 Douglas Alexander\uc2  do not appear to want to even address the issue of our relationship with Brussels that is increasingly dominating the political agenda.\par \par \uc2 Miliband recently gave the Parliamentary Labour Party a pep talk about strategy for the year ahead but failed to make any mention of the referendum debate. "The word Europe did not cross his lips once during the entire presentation," one Labour MP told me.\par \par \uc2 THE Labour leader is instinctively deeply uncomfortable with the idea of referendums and fears that giving in to demands for one about Europe could come back to haunt him.\par \par \uc2 Despite Labour's relatively slender opinion poll lead he dreams that the electoral arithmetic can put him into 10 Downing Street at the next election and genuinely fears he could end up being prime minister of a country that votes to quit the EU.\par \par \uc2 "Miliband's nightmare is a waferthin Labour majority, a resurgent Tory Party led by a new Euro\u8211\'20\'13sceptic leader \u8211\'20\'13 Boris Johnson for example \u8211\'20\'13 and a referendum within 18 months," one source close to a leading Labour donor told me.\par \par \uc2 The conclusion the Labour leader's inner circle drew from Labour's thumping margin of victory in last week's Wythenshawe and Sale East by\u8211\'20\'13election is that Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party is stealing plenty of Tory votes but is not a threat to Labour.\par \par \uc2 "The Tory\u8211\'20\'13Ukip share of the vote was the same in the by\u8211\'20\'13election as at the general election. There is no sign of Ukip taking Labour voters," said a senior Labour source.\par \par \uc2 Many party insiders believe that smacks of dangerous complacency given that the poll was held in Labour's heartlands and followed the death of local MP Paul Goggins who was hugely popular in the constituency.\par \par \uc2 Ukip have made no secret of their desire to attract blue\u8211\'20\'13collar voters who traditionally backed Labour but feel betrayed by the last government on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and welfare. Some shadow ministers privately admit that the anti\u8211\'20\'13Brussels party is gaining ground in Labour territory.\par \par \uc2 MILIBAND is set to make a final decision about how to respond to Cameron's referendum pledge after votes are counted in May's elections for the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 . But with the polls suggesting Labour could turn in a creditable performance that result could well simply reinforce his conviction that a referendum on EU membership is best avoided.\par \par \uc2 However it is unlikely to allay the concerns within the Shadow Cabinet. Some frontbenchers are worried that Labour is going into the euro election campaign without a clear position on the referendum question and are mystified about what the party's manifesto for the Euro elections will say on the crucial issue.\par \par \uc2 Even more importantly they are desperately worried about the signal that Miliband's refusal to back an EU referendum sends to the electorate. His opposition to giving voters a say about the country's future could well be taken as a sign of contempt.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140222ea2m0002s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Weekend Life\par \b \uc2 On the right page\b0\par\par\uc2 Claire Black   \par \uc2 2,161 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par \uc2 The Scotsman\par \uc2 SC\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014   \par \par \uc2 The first book that Liesel Meminger takes is from the graveside of her brother. It's to remind her of him. She can't read, but even without being able to decipher the marks printed on each page, Liesel knows that the book is special. This first theft marks the beginning of her lifelong obsession. Books are Liesel's addiction, her escape, they are her adventure and her salvation.\par \par \uc2 Liesel is one of the most popular characters in fiction of recent years. The protagonist of Markus Zusak's bestselling novel The Book Thief, she is the orphaned daughter of German communist activists who is taken in by a middle aged couple, the Hubermanns, in 1938. Liesel is a good German girl, with Swastika badges sewn on to her school jacket, she can sing the songs of the Hitler Youth. But her life changes when the Hubermanns agree to hide the son of a Jewish man who saved Hans's life in the Great War.\par \par \uc2 The Book Thief is an international bestseller. It has been translated into more than 40 languages and spent 230 weeks on the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 ' bestseller list. Liesel, the beating heart of the novel, has become a beloved heroine. It's ironic then that when French-Canadian actress, Sophie Nelisse, got the call to audition for the role in the film adaptation of the novel, there was a complication. Nelisse, 13, was, at that time, training seriously as a gymnast with the intention of competing in the Rio Olympics.\par \par \uc2 "I really wasn't sure if I wanted to audition," she says, "because if I got the part it would mean giving up my dream." She decided to do it just for fun, assuming that she wouldn't actually win the role. Such was her nonchalance she went into the audition without having read either the script for the film or the book. Surviving the first audition, she was invited to a second in Los Angeles. On the plane flying from her home in Montreal, Canada, she read the script.\par \par \uc2 "It was the first time a script made me cry," she says. "By the time I had my third audition in Berlin, I loved the character and the story so much. I was so, so happy when I got the part."\par \par \uc2 If Nelisse, who has both film and television credits to her name in her native Canada, felt a pressure bringing Liesel to the screen, she's forgotten about it. She was, she says, helped by the atmosphere on set, which was so friendly and upbeat, despite the subject matter of the film, that she felt entirely comfortable. And given the calibre of the acting talent with whom Nelisse shares the screen, Geoffrey Rush in sparkling, charming form and a ferociously bad-tempered Emily Watson as Liesel's adoptive parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, that's no mean feat. As a lesson in screen acting it must have been quite the masterclass.\par \par \uc2 "I could have sat and watched them all day every day," she says. "Emily is a bit more of a method actor than Geoffrey, she really stayed in character. She's so smart and so concentrated all the time, but I'm a bit more like Geoffrey, it's only when they say 'action' that I completely go into character. He does it perfectly."\par \par \uc2 In fact, Nelisse hadn't seen any of the work of either Rush or Watson before she got on set. Well almost none of it. "Obviously I'd seen Geoffrey in Pirates of the Caribbean," she says sheepishly, "but I didn't know what else he'd done. And when I was told that I was acting with Emily Watson, I thought they meant Emma Watson. I was like 'Oh my god, mom, I'm playing with Emma Watson'. And she was like 'no, it's Emily'." Nelisse giggles.\par \par \uc2 For Zusak, Nelisse captures the spirit of his character and translates it directly on to the screen. She is, he says, "amazing".\par \par \uc2 The Book Thief was first published in 2005. Zusak was 30 when he wrote it. He'd already written four novels, each for young adults, but none of them showed the same scope or ambition as The Book Thief. He had intended it to be a novella, but it grew into something much more dense and complex. "In hindsight, I should have seen it coming," he says. "I wanted that book to really mean something to me, as with every book you start, but it ended up meaning everything."\par \par \uc2 Zusak's parents were \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from Germany who went to Australia. Neither of them could speak any English when they arrived. They learned. Later, when they were married and had children, it was the stories they told of their childhoods during the Second World War that fired their son Markus's imagination. When it came to writing his novel, it was those stories he called upon. Two events in particular had grabbed Zusak's imagination: the bombing of Munich and the whipping of a teenage boy and the emaciated Jew being marched through the streets, to whom he'd offered a piece of bread, by a Nazi soldier.\par \par \uc2 "Every family contains its own stories, but somehow every family also has one family story so for ours it's the story of both my parents coming to Australia with nothing really other than their stories. And those are about growing up during and just after World War II.\par \par \uc2 "I remember sitting in our kitchen in Sydney and the weather outside was beautiful but when my mum and dad would tell us their story it was as though a piece of Europe came into that room. We grew up, my brother and my two sisters, hearing about cities that were on fire and ground that was covered in ice. Going into bomb shelters and emerging out into a different world."\par \par \uc2 The characters of The Book Thief are composites of people that Zusak heard about when he was growing up through the stories his parents and their friends, most of whom were \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from Germany and Austria. The experience that Zusak documents is that of ordinary Germans caught up in the Nazi onslaught, people who were living under Nazi rule, but far from being party members.\par \par \uc2 "They were usually thinking about how to do the best thing by their family or the people around them," he says. "My dad told me his father was called 'the Jew painter' because he still painted for the Jewish people who lived in their community. He didn't join the Nazi Party and he didn't get work as a result of it.\par \par \uc2 "Those were the stories I knew, stories of daily life. One of the most vivid I remember was from my mum who said that her parents were always arguing on Hitler's birthday because her dad didn't want to put the Nazi flag in the window whereas his wife was worried that he'd be taken away if it didn't appear. But what it meant to me was that people didn't want to hang the flag."\par \par \uc2 The characters Zusak created are fictional, but the influence of his family exists on every page. He says that the book wouldn't be what it is if his father wasn't a house painter as his father was before him and as Zusak's brother is too. "If I hadn't gone painting with my dad when I was a kid, I don't think I would have had the idea of Max painting over the pages of Mein Kampf so that he and Liesel can write the story of their friendship on top of it."\par \par \uc2 Zusak read books voraciously as a child. He was 16 when he made his own first attempt at writing one.\par \par \uc2 "It's eight pages and it could be entered into any worst book award," he says, over a phone line from Los Angeles where the circus that is promotion for the film is taking place around him. "But that's the perfect way to start because you're only going to improve."\par \par \uc2 Zusak's charm is that he's completely down to earth. Humble. And funny. Sitting in his fancy hotel suite in sunny Los Angeles it's clear that he's peering through the window at the film world with a kind of wry bemusement. "I'm not from LA," he says with a laugh. "I remember I used to get calls from a movie executive, it would always be his secretary who'd ring and then she'd say, 'I've got such and such on the line for Markus Zusak'. There was this one time that I was to call him and I couldn't get through. I was trying and trying and eventually my wife said let me, just in case she was going to have the magic touch on the phone even though she was dialling the same number. Of course it got picked up and my wife just said, 'I've got Markus Zusak here for...'" He laughs. "It's the only time I ever had a secretary."\par \par \uc2 Zusak didn't adapt his novel into a screenplay, so as the writer of the source material, he's separate, not quite a hanger on, but of a different world to the movie machine mobilising around the film. The contrasts are fun, of course, from dialling his own phone much to the consternation of the woman who had been sent to his room to dial it for him, to being astonished at the need for a fleet of five cars to transport five people. Zusak is an observer so there's plenty for him to enjoy. But, for a writer, the process of witnessing his novel being transformed into a movie isn't necessarily straightforward.\par \par \uc2 "It's so many things all at once," he says. "I think if someone asked me to explain what it's really been like in five years' time, I think by then I'd have the answer, but now it's difficult to say. There are times when it's exciting but there are times when it's daunting too. It's a bit like when your first book gets published - that's a foreign thing as well."\par \par \uc2 Zusak has a keen sense of being an outsider. When he started writing he knew nothing about publishing. He'd never been to a book fair or a festival before he had a book published.\par \par \uc2 "I had no idea that that's how you can get published - you meet people. I couldn't even understand such a thing. Sometimes knowing nothing is the best thing because when you turn up you can only be yourself so if nothing else you're a breath of fresh air and you don't have any big expectations. For me it's been a rollercoaster. The hardest part is when you're not doing any work, or talking to anyone, then it's the click click click of making the first ascent, but once it's actually going you don't even have time to think and that's the fun part."\par \par \uc2 Zusak is a fascinating proposition - an award-winning, bestselling author, he's also unfailingly modest, almost shy. He's most at ease when he's talking about his family, telling amusing stories about his mum and dad, who he says are both "so funny".\par \par \uc2 "When the book was published in Germany, we got a copy of the edition and my dad read both the English and the German versions practically side by side," he says. "When he finished he said, 'It's not exactly that the book is s**t in English, it's just so much better in German.'" He laughs. "He spent the next hour trying to make up for it, but it only got worse."\par \par \uc2 The book was received warmly in Germany which means a great deal to Zusak, not least because it means the stories that his mum and dad brought from Germany to Australia have been in a way, returned. "It felt really special," he says. "I was bringing those stories back. Something about that felt really right."\par \par \uc2 It's clear that Zusak has learned the gift of storytelling from his mum and dad. His chat flows and he's funny. But there's another side to the telling of stories in his family and in his work that's equally important to him.\par \par \uc2 "I realise now that when my mum and dad were telling us these things, they were not only telling us about their childhood, they were also in so many ways teaching me how to write. We're made of stories as much as we're made of anything."\par \par \uc2 The Book Thief (12A) is on general release from Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Document SC00000020140222ea2m00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw157\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2355\pichgoal600

She returns to Glasgow as part of the Fallen Angels Club 10th anniversary celebrations.\par \par \uc2 St Andrews in the Square, Glasgow, 28 February, 0141-204 5151\par \par \uc2 FIONA SHEPHERD\par \par \uc2 ART: NEW ACQUISITIONS\par \par \uc2 New Acquisitions at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art tells a remarkable story of imaginative collecting in difficult times. There are a lot of good things to see, a lot of them by modern Scottish artists, some well-known, but others hardly known at all. It's worth making the trip while they are still on the wall.\par \par \uc2 Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, until 4 May, 0131-624 6200\par \par \uc2 DUNCAN MACMILLAN\par \par \uc2 THEATRE: GLLASGOW GIRLS\par \par \uc2 For a Scotland on the brink of big decisions about its future, there's no finer feelgood musical than Glasgow Girls, last year's smash-hit show about the seven Glasgow schoolgirls who - in the mid-2000s - staged a successful campaign to prevent the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  authorities from deporting their asylum-seeker schoolmates and friends. With music by director Cora Bissett, Soom T, Patricia Panther and the Kielty Brothers, Glasgow Girls is a funny and moving love-song to the idea of a modern, multicultural Glasgow, strongly based on a true story; it lifts the heart, and throws in some fine tunes, for good measure.\par \par \uc2 Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow, until 8 March, 0141-429 0022\par \par \uc2 JOYCE MCMILLAN\par \par \uc2 CLASSICAL: SCOTTISH ENSEMBLE: LOVE AND WAR IN BOHEMIA\par \par \uc2 Mezzo soprano Sophie Harmsen joins the Scottish Ensemble in Dvorak's enchanting Love Songs. Other Bohemian delights include Pavel Haas's Study for Strings (written while the composer was a Nazi prisoner in Theresienstadt) and Suk's Serenade for Strings.

Friedkin is a master of delivering nerve-shredding tension, and he gets the most out of an ingenious plot about four desperados forced to drive a truck full of nitroglycerin through the jungles of South America.\par \par \uc2 Cineworld, Glasgow, 27 February, 0141-332 6535/glasgowfilm.org/festival\par \par \uc2 ALISTAIR HARKNESS\par \par \uc2 Document SC00000020140222ea2m00005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

But when the case reached the court again yesterday, a judge rejected their challenge to Glyndwr, which has thousands of students from Merseyside.\par \par \uc2 The decision means their status in the UK will be reviewed by the Home Office.\par \par \uc2 Document LIVECH0020140222ea2m0003q\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Chris Moyles claimed to be second-hand car dealer to save up to \u163\'00\'A31m in tax\b0\par\par\uc2 438 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par 07:35\par \uc2 dailystar.co.uk\par \uc2 DAICO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 EX-RADIO 1 DJ Chris Moyles claimed to be a second-hand car dealer in a bid to save up to \u163\'00\'A31 million in tax, a tribunal has found.\par \par \uc2 The 39-year-old and two other men were named by a tax court as having taken part in a scheme called "working wheels".\par \par \uc2 Members included "450 fund managers, celebrities and other high earners between 2006 and 2008".\par \par \uc2 The scheme worked by allowing its members to say they had incurred large fees while working in the second-hand car trade, which they could claim back against their tax bill.\par \par \uc2 A published judgment from the Tax Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal said Moyles's self-assessment tax return for the financial year ending on April 5, 2008 - when he was presenting Radio One's Breakfast Show - said he "had engaged in self-employment as a used car trader".\par \par \uc2 Related articles Jim Davidson documentary At Least I'm Not Boring airs on Channel 5 EU frauds: Dossier exposes \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  rip-off as crooks claim for welfare support\par \par \uc2 Moyles did not give evidence directly to the tribunal but did submit "a brief witness statement".\par \par \uc2 The tribunal, under Judge Colin Bishopp, described that evidence as "very brief and rather uninformative".\par \par \uc2 The judgment said: "It is however quite clear from the statement that he too entered the scheme for no purpose other than to achieve a tax saving, and that he took no interest in the trade."\par \par \uc2 It went on to say that Moyles was "anxious to be reassured that the scheme was lawful, and that he would not have to undertake any trading himself".\par \par \uc2 It said his accountant, a Mr Smith, had "agreed that the scale of Moyles's borrowing was driven solely by the amount of the tax loss he wanted to achieve, in his case \u163\'00\'A31 million, and that the trading was not carried on for its own sake but was merely a means to an end".\par \par \uc2 Exchequer Secretary David Gauke said: "This case is another example of why taxpayers should not fall for the promises of promoters selling schemes that are all too often too good to be true.\par \par \uc2 "Not only will the taxpayer waste money on the fees for these failed schemes, they will still have to pay all the tax, interest and penalties that are due.\par \par \uc2 "This Government has provided HMRC with the resources to tackle these avoidance schemes and HMRC will now pursue the other users of the scheme to make sure all the taxes that are due are paid."\par \par \uc2 Document DAICO00020140222ea2m001e1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Magazine\par \b \uc2 The house in this season\u8217\'20\'19s colours; Everything is subject to change in the Connecticut home of Amy Smilovic, the fashion-forward founder of the Tibi label\b0\par\par\uc2 Abigail Radnor   \par \uc2 766 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par 13:40\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 During the first five years that Amy Smilovic lived in her six-bedroom, six-bathroom house in \u8220\'20\'1Cback country" Connecticut, her friends were less than impressed. When they visited the home, with its three reception rooms, kitchen, office, hall, basement and swimming pool, they were looking forward to seeing what the creator of fashion label Tibi had done with the space. They left disappointed. The house was nothing like they had imagined, right down to a bizarre monkey motif in the bathroom.\par \par \uc2 The truth was that Smilovic had been so intimidated by the house that she hadn\u8217\'20\'19t touched it since she and her husband, Frank, bought it in 2000. \u8220\'20\'1CThe place was all mustards and deep reds, with very heavy curtains," Smilovic explains. \u8220\'20\'1CIt was sort of New England meets faux French country. There was chintz everywhere. It was just sad and moody."\par \par \uc2 Smilovic never intended to make this house near Greenwich her family home. The couple bought it at the same time as their loft on Crosby Street in SoHo, Manhattan, which they saw as their permanent base. But after having their first baby (her sons are now 13 and 10), they changed their minds. \u8220\'20\'1CMy husband is European and had been working overseas for \uc2 American Express\uc2  for ever, in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore. He was craving a permanent space and a piece of land," says Smilovic. \u8220\'20\'1CGreenwich was perfect \u8211\'20\'13 close enough to the city, but you feel like you\u8217\'20\'19re in another world out here."\par \par \uc2 Incidentally, they used their SoHo loft as premises for their business. (Frank now runs the financial and legal sides of the company.) Smilovic\u8217\'20\'19s advertisement for seamstresses caught the eye of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  officials, who suspected she may have been running a sweatshop. \u8220\'20\'1CThey turned up, saw two seamstresses and this beautiful fireplace and were like, \u8216\'20\'18Erm, can we work here?\u8217\'20\'19\u8202\'20\'0A"\par \par \uc2 It was only when Smilovic made her home a work project that she embarked on renovations. \u8220\'20\'1CI called my head of PR and told her to get in touch with InStyle magazine so we could do a before and after feature." She employed the help of interior designer Bruce Shostak, whose first question was, \u8220\'20\'1CWhat do you hate most about the house?" Smilovic pointed to the mustard curtains with cockerel motifs in her kitchen. Shostak simply tore them down. \u8220\'20\'1CHe showed me how to react right away when something annoyed me. I can\u8217\'20\'19t believe I lived with those curtains for five years."\par \par \uc2 From that moment it was a relatively speedy transformation, completed within six months. \u8220\'20\'1COnce I set my mind to something, I can make decisions quickly." To create a minimalist yet bold aesthetic, Smilovic turned to what she knew best and drew up fashion mood boards. \u8220\'20\'1CThe bedroom colours were inspired by a past Chlo\u233\'00\'E9 spring collection. I found it the easiest way to communicate which colours I was in the mood for, how bold the room should be and how clean the fabrics should look and feel."\par \par \uc2 Despite her daring use of colour and print throughout the house, Smilovic factored in her tendency to get bored very quickly, a trait that irritates her husband. \u8220\'20\'1CI created everything in the house to be functional, so that I can change it once I tire of it. I need to have options to make quick fixes, such as re-covering the kitchen chairs [recently changed from green and white fabric to a \u8220\'20\'1Ccalming" grey and white], changing the pillows or recarpeting certain rooms."\par \par \uc2 Smilovic is constantly on the lookout for new additions to their homes. \u8220\'20\'1CI could browse furniture online all day, especially on 1stdibs.com." She also loves the warehouse shops on the waterfront in Stamford, Connecticut, with her favourite being Irwin Feld (which also has a space on 1stdibs.com), a specialist in mid-century modern pieces. Her husband can\u8217\'20\'19t understand why she keeps throwing out perfectly decent furniture to make room for new items, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut I try to make him understand that you can\u8217\'20\'19t just stick to an interior from the time you first made money. Otherwise, it would all look very Eighties or Nineties."\par \par \uc2 What she hasn\u8217\'20\'19t told her husband is that she feels the urge to go Scandinavian neutral, injected with a note of colour to give it her signature warmth. \u8220\'20\'1CThat would require a complete overhaul. I don\u8217\'20\'19t dare bring it up."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://tibi.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 tibi.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140222ea2m0030d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 If Cameron is serious about winning, he's got to send for Gove\b0\par\par\uc2 By Iain Martin   \par \uc2 1,328 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par 19:11\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Every prime minister fears having a Winter of Discontent moment, when a crisis that had seemed controllable suddenly becomes a career-curtailing catastrophe.\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 Jim Callaghan\uc2 , it was a wave of industrial unrest. For John Major, it came on September 16 1992, when the pound fell out of the ERM. In both cases, the sense of mounting chaos seemed to confirm a bigger truth about the governing party: that it was either incompetent or had simply spent too long in power, and needed to be removed.\par \par \uc2 Now, in the age of 24-hour television news and incessant social-media chatter, leaders must stay even more alert, for fear that a poor response to a foot-and-mouth outbreak, or an explosion of summer rioting, or a period of record rainfall, will cause voters to conclude that the government has lost control.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, as the flood waters rose, it seemed \u8211\'20\'13 for a few days \u8211\'20\'13 as though the Prime Minister was about to be swamped. Realising belatedly how serious the situation had become, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  took personal charge of the government response. Since then, he has rarely been seen out of wellies and black fleece, worn day after day.\par \par \uc2 But unless another epic deluge falls on low-lying land in the next week or so, it now seems clear that Mr Cameron has weathered this latest storm. Although the clean-up is going to take months, and the terrible distress goes on for those whose homes were submerged, the crisis is no longer leading the national news, and the waters are no longer lapping at the front door of No 10. So the Prime Minister can get back to the urgent task of working out how to sink Ed Miliband.\par \par \uc2 More on this story\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/geoffreylean/100260535/calls-for-owen-paterson-to-be-sacked-are-wrong-and-reprehensible/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Calls for Owen Paterson to be sacked are reprehensible}}}\uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/pollingobservatory/100259331/conservative-pundits-hope-2015-will-be-like-1992-but-the-polls-suggests-that-it-could-be-more-like-1997/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Will the next election be 1992 again, or 1997?}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/benedictbrogan/100260203/david-cameron-takes-on-the-archbishop-and-the-left/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 David Cameron takes on the Archbishop – and the Left}}}\par \par \uc2 On his return from the floodplains, Mr Cameron will find that the electoral fundamentals have not altered much. The Tories had hoped they were narrowing the gap, due to the improving economy, but Labour remains stubbornly ahead. Occasionally, a poll shows the Conservatives getting very close, but generally Mr Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s party holds a lead of around five points or more.\par \par \uc2 Presented with this evidence, Tory veterans point out that the party has been here before. The Labour lead is, they say, surmountable. At the equivalent point ahead of the 1987 general election, the Tories were stuck in the low thirties, and Neil Kinnock \u8211\'20\'13 with a lead pretty similar to Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s now \u8211\'20\'13 appeared to be heading for Downing Street. Margaret Thatcher went on to win with a majority of 102 seats.\par \par \uc2 Those, however, were very different days. For a start, Mrs Thatcher did not have to deal with Ukip \u8211\'20\'13 although she would certainly not have been as blas about a new party emerging on her Right flank as Mr Cameron was, or have dismissed distressed voters worried about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and declining living standards as \u8220\'20\'1Cfruitcakes".\par \par \uc2 She was lucky, too, in that it was the Left that was split in the Eighties, whereas it is the Tory tribe that has now suffered a fracture. Ukip is regularly polling around 10 per cent, having attracted many previously loyal Tory voters and activists who cannot stand the sight of Mr Cameron.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Thatcher was also lucky in having Mr Kinnock as an opponent. Whatever his virtues as a brave reformer of a party that had lost its marbles, he was not a leader many Britons could imagine standing on the steps of No 10. And therein lie the main Tory grounds for hope.\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s struggle to look prime ministerial has been a desperate battle, but it is being fought in vain \u8211\'20\'13 and I speak as someone who has said from the start of his leadership that he should not be underestimated. Yes, he is tougher than he looks, and the electoral arithmetic is in his favour. But Mr Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s failure in the last three-and-a-half years to establish a connection \u8211\'20\'13 any connection \u8211\'20\'13 with the electorate leaves him badly exposed.\par \par \uc2 Ask yourself when you last heard a Labour voter, never mind a Labour MP, express unbridled, transparently genuine enthusiasm for the idea of Mr Miliband moving into Downing Street. Knowing this, the Tory high command aims to devote the year ahead to \u8220\'20\'1CKinnockising" Mr Miliband, presenting him both as the heir to \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  and as a Westminster geek not up to the job.\par \par \uc2 The remaining Tory modernisers tend to find such talk distasteful. In recent months, they have pleaded with Mr Cameron to offer some optimism, some positive vision, rather than negativity. Of course, hope should form a part of the Tory offer. But if the party wants to win, there is also going to have to be a good deal less squeamishness.\par \par \uc2 Consider what is at stake. For all that it is fashionable to claim that the differences between the parties are vanishingly small, at the next election it will simply not be true. Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband have dramatically contrasting outlooks, rooted in radically different views of human nature.\par \par \uc2 Mr Miliband is quite clear that he is a high-tax statist, intensely suspicious of private enterprise and individual responsibility. Mr Cameron wants the state to be smaller and more effective, and individuals, families and businesses to have the freedom to create prosperity.\par \par \uc2 As business has started to wake up to this, and to work out what it would mean in terms of taxes and regulation if Mr Miliband should win by default, terror about the economic consequences of a Labour victory has begun to spread across the City and beyond.\par \par \uc2 The Tories know that by polling day, they must make such concerns a preoccupation of mainstream voters. To do so, they must marmalise Mr Miliband, until every floating voter, every Tory even slightly tempted by Ukip, has nightmares about what lies in store.\par \par \uc2 They must also remind such waverers that, if they want an In/Out referendum on the EU, they will not get it by flirting with Nigel Farage and letting in Labour.\par \par \uc2 What remains to be seen, however, is whether Mr Cameron and his team are prepared to do all that is necessary. Ahead of the toughest and messiest election in a generation, the Tories still do not have all of their best players in the right positions.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron urgently needs a big beast in CCHQ, one capable of elegantly bashing Mr Miliband on the airwaves while demolishing the proposition that Britain\u8217\'20\'19s economic recovery should be gambled away on another round of Ed Balls.\par \par \uc2 Such a change would mean reshuffling the enthusiastic Grant Shapps, who now occupies the post of party chairman. The man for the job should be Michael Gove, the Education Secretary. His epic work on school reform is done (for this parliament, at least) and the legislative heavy-lifting is over \u8211\'20\'13 indeed, his closest advisers have already left government.\par \par \uc2 If the Prime Minister suggested such a move, Mr Gove would doubtless chain himself to his desk in the Department for Education and plead to stay there. But he is by far Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s best option. And while \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  has never wanted a powerful Tory chairman who could build a rival power base, he could potentially be squared due to his close working relationship and strong friendship with Mr Gove.\par \par \uc2 If the Conservatives are serious, they will soon need to rise above petty internal concerns and do everything within their power to win. It is time to throw the kitchen sink at Mr Miliband.\par \par \uc2 More by Iain Martin:\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/iainmartin1/100260108/alex-salmond-and-nigel-farage-are-both-blowing-up-at-the-same-time/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Salmond and Farage are both blowing up at the same time}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/iainmartin1/100259785/the-archbishop-is-wrong-on-welfare-the-safety-net-is-not-being-scrapped/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 The Archbishop is wrong on welfare}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/iainmartin1/100259695/europes-museums-should-launch-a-campaign-to-return-george-clooney-to-america/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 We should launch a campaign to return Clooney to America}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140223ea2m0002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FINANCE\par \b \uc2 'Why does the Government think food production is not important? Outgoing \uc2 National Farmers' Union\uc2  president \uc2 Peter Kendall\uc2  says government is making a mistake and should treat farms like vital businesses; PETER KENDALL CV\b0\par\par\uc2 By Andrew Cave   \par \uc2 1,627 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 February 2014\par 21:30\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Farming may appear to be in crisis as a result of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s floods but, after eight years as president of the \uc2 National Farmers\u8217\'20\'19 Union\uc2  of England and Wales, \uc2 Peter Kendall\uc2  feels the industry is in a much better position than when he arrived.\par \par \uc2 His fourth and final two-year term will finish on Wednesday, when the union\u8217\'20\'19s 55,000 members are due to vote on his successor at their annual conference.\par \par \uc2 So how does the current farming landscape differ from eight years ago? Kendall hardly knows where to start.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe mood of the industry was pretty depressed," he recalls. \u8220\'20\'1CWe were at the height of the first round of payments from the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2004 and the computers were all imploding.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Government had imposed a system on English farmers that was completely different from almost all the rest of Europe and the rest of the UK, arrogantly declaring that we were going to show Europe how to do CAP reform.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn that first year, we had to do emergency single-farm payments because the computers weren\u8217\'20\'19t fit for purpose and we had delivered an over-complicated reform.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CCommodity prices were depressed and the message to the farming industry was that food production was almost an inconvenient by-product of environmental management. The attitude was that we didn\u8217\'20\'19t need farmers."\par \par \uc2 Kendall, who farms with his brother on Bedfordshire\u8217\'20\'19s border with Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire, stood in the first contested NFU election against a sitting president, saying that he wanted to shake things up.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI felt that the industry wanted someone who was prepared to be very visible and give a very public lead to an industry championing the importance of British agriculture," he says.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur first campaign was 'Why Farming Matters\u8217\'20\'19. In 2014 it seems absurd that we ever had to make that case, but our first principle was to try to re-establish the view that productive farming is important and that the UK has an important role to play."\par \par \uc2 British farming has been helped by three major global agricultural price spikes in the past six years. Kendall also sees great improvement in government support, with the UK\u8217\'20\'19s agricultural technology strategy committed to making the nation a world leader in agricultural science and technology.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat a change of heart that is," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ve now got a government that realises that if you want to build a knowledge-based economy with a world population growing by 17m-18m every year and working towards a total of 9.5bn, our agricultural science base ought to be central."\par \par \uc2 The past governmental ambivalence or even downright hostility to productive farming was due, Kendall thinks, to the \u163\'00\'A320bn combined cost to the Exchequer of the BSE and foot and mouth disease crises.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere was a view that farming was both an economic risk to the economy and an environmental risk as well," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CI believe that the conclusion was reached that the smaller Britain\u8217\'20\'19s agricultural industry was, the less risk there would be to the economy and the environment.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat was the depressing state of mind that we tried to set about changing among farmers and also among the wider public."\par \par \uc2 Other crises have followed. In 2007, the NFU had to deal with bird flu, another outbreak of foot and mouth disease and blue tongue disease among cattle. More recently, there was last year\u8217\'20\'19s horse-meat scandal and a crisis in the dairy industry in 2012, when \uc2 Dairy Crest\uc2  cut the price of milk by 2p, taking UK dairy prices to near the bottom of the league table of the 27 \uc2 European Union\uc2  states.\par \par \uc2 That was an \u8220\'20\'1Cabsolute disgrace," says Kendall, whose approach to all the crises has been that the NFU has to be \u8220\'20\'1Crelentlessly positive".\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ve tried to get away from the notion that we\u8217\'20\'19re whingeing farmers, grumpy old men leaning on a five-bar gate chewing straw and telling everybody how unfair life is.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is an exciting, innovative industry that\u8217\'20\'19s central to the big global challenges of food security and climate change," he says.\par \par \uc2 Kendall is proud of the relationships fostered with Britain\u8217\'20\'19s supermarket groups. \uc2 Philip Clarke\uc2 , chief executive of Tesco, has spoken at the NFU\u8217\'20\'19s conference, while the Co-operative Group has moved towards ensuring that meat in its ready meals is 100pc British and Sainsbury\u8217\'20\'19s has made commitments to moving towards all-British beef.\par \par \uc2 Kendall is also proud of defeating Whitehall mandarins who wanted 7pc of agricultural land to be \u8220\'20\'1Cset aside", or left out of production.\par \par \uc2 Now he says the major UK food retailers are clamouring to support British meat, with the red tractor insignia verifying where meat is sourced from. Meanwhile, British dairy prices are at a record high, ranking in the top third of EU nations.\par \par \uc2 Kendall says a voluntary code on dairy prices, introduced after lobbying by the NFU, means British dairy farmers are \u8220\'20\'1Cprobably more confident than they\u8217\'20\'19ve been for 10 or 15 years".\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s much more to do, however, with Kendall believing that the floods show that governmental attitudes still tend towards regarding farmland as an environmental habitat, as opposed to being productive land.\par \par \uc2 That means, he claims, that irrigation ditches are regarded by some as primarily for wildlife, with farmers\u8217\'20\'19 fields seen as flood barriers.\par \par \uc2 He complains of poorly-maintained ditches and compares Britain unfavourably with Holland, where he says flood concerns come first and irrigation ditches are well-kept.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI completely understand that people\u8217\'20\'19s safety and houses have to come first," he says, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut climate change magnifies enormously the challenge of food security globally.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe seem to have had 'once in 100 years\u8217\'20\'19 weather events about three times during my time as president.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor me, the pendulum has swung too far to 'environment first\u8217\'20\'19 and farming not being important.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m not saying farmland shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t act as a buffer, but what it shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t do is act as water storage and be undervalued.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor farmers, when it is all over your fields and you can\u8217\'20\'19t get it away, you get pretty depressed.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe need to get land back into production. Once land has been under water for three to four weeks, everything is killed, including wildlife."\par \par \uc2 Despite the damage wreaked by the floods, however, Kendall believes that, as it stands today, the bad weather will not have anywhere near as bad an impact as the wet autumn of 2012.\par \par \uc2 That saw wheat planting fall 30pc, delivering a 2013 harvest of 12m tonnes \u8211\'20\'13 the lowest since 1978 and well down on the recent average of 16m tonnes.\par \par \uc2 The 2012 British wheat harvest of 13m tonnes was also \u8220\'20\'1Cdiabolical", says Kendall, citing a lack of summer sunshine.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYes, there\u8217\'20\'19s a lot of flooding around at the moment," he says, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut in terms of gross output, I don\u8217\'20\'19t think it will have an impact similar to those.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAt the moment I would expect Britain to have a more normal wheat harvest this year. We could do 16m tonnes again. About 80pc of the nation\u8217\'20\'19s wheat is grown in a 50-mile radius of Cambridge and that area has not been badly affected.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut for those farmers in Somerset, it\u8217\'20\'19s catastrophic because it is the second year on the trot.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor some, it will probably be ruinous. For others around the country, if it\u8217\'20\'19s for only a few weeks around the Thames, for example, you hope they are resilient enough to see their way through it."\par \par \uc2 There are other worries in the world of farming, with Kendall particularly concerned that tighter \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rules are damaging farmers\u8217\'20\'19 ability to harvest their crops.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t harvest our fruit and vegetables without migrant workers," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CWe don\u8217\'20\'19t want farming to get massively disadvantaged in the debate about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 He also wants planning rules relaxed for agricultural buildings and says he is \u8220\'20\'1Cbitterly disappointed" that the Treasury does not allow depreciation of new farm buildings and reservoirs against tax \u8211\'20\'13 something that was removed in 2007.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s a really unhelpful mindset in the Treasury that says: 'Don\u8217\'20\'19t farmers get enough help already?\u8217\'20\'19 " he complains. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat I want is for them to treat farms like businesses.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhy don\u8217\'20\'19t they get that we produce the raw materials for the biggest manufacturing sector in the economy?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFood manufacturing has 3.7m jobs in the UK and if we don\u8217\'20\'19t produce the raw materials here, the processing will go overseas as well.\par \par \uc2 'We\u8217\'20\'19ve had 20 years of government not thinking that food production is important.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFarmers don\u8217\'20\'19t believe that enough is being done but we see the words of the Prime Minister and the media coverage of the past few weeks as an opportunity to realign the pendulum a little bit."\par \par \uc2 As for Kendall, where will his own career pendulum swing after Wednesday?\par \par \uc2 He claims not to have figured that out yet, though he has ruled out progressing from eight years in government lobbying to a career in politics.\par \par \uc2 Back to the land, then? \u8220\'20\'1CThe thought of that is making my brother nervous," he laughs.\par \par \uc2 English and Welsh farmers might just reassure him.\par \par \uc2 Age 53\par \par \uc2 Family Married with three children.

After David Cameron came to power, he claimed Tories raised the threat of \u8216\'20\'18\uc2 NHS\uc2  privatisation\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 In November, Mr Shah sponsored an event at Labour\u8217\'20\'19s London HQ to celebrate the\u160\'00\'A0 Diwali festival.

On losing her Commons seat 2010, she became chief executive of the Independent Pharmacy Federation lobby group. Sigma has funded the organisation and describes itself as \u8216\'20\'18a long standing supporter\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Mr Shah is a keen motorsports enthusiast who tries to attend three Grands Prix a year. He once said: \u8216\'20\'18All the Formula 1 races take place in nice destinations. It\u8217\'20\'19s quite nice to go to Rio, Abu Dhabi or Shanghai.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The conference in Cancun was organised by the Sigma pharmaceuticals giant, run by respected Anglo-Indian businessman Mr Shah.\par \par \uc2 He was a cheerleader for Mr Blair, is a friend and admirer of Mr Miliband and his firm has given money to Labour coffers.\par \par \uc2 While politicians on all sides last week visited flood-hit towns and villages and discussed how to stop it happening again, 56-year-old Mr Gardiner left it all behind, flying 5,000 miles to the stretch of Mexico\u8217\'20\'19s Caribbean coastknown as \u8216\'20\'18the Mayan Riviera\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 The Brent North MP and his wife Caroline, a sculptor and poet, who is also paid \u163\'00\'A325,000 as her husband\u8217\'20\'19s Commons \u8216\'20\'18\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  adviser\u8217\'20\'19, were ostensibly attending a pharmaceutical industry convention.\par \par \uc2 In exchange for giving just one hour-long speech on Tuesday, the couple got to stay in a lavish \u163\'00\'A3325-a-night suite at the Sunrise Hotel within the Moon Palace resort.\par \par \uc2 The suite has a sunken two-person jacuzzi and views over a tropical garden.\par \par \uc2 But if Mr Gardiner had wanted to maintain a low profile as he lazed by the pool in 85F (29C) sunshine, his presence was revealed when some of the 460 other delegates at the Moon Palace tweeted about him.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Mr Gardiner \u8211\'20\'13 in Hawaiian shirt and Panama hat \u8211\'20\'13 spent his last full day in Cancun swimming, eating and enjoying a romantic walk with his wife along the Caribbean beach.\par \par \uc2 Earlier in the week, the couple wore Indian-style clothing for a \u8216\'20\'18Bollywood Night\u8217\'20\'19 and on another evening Mr Gardiner donned a tuxedo for a black tie dinner in the ballroom.\par \par \uc2 Mr Gardiner is not breaking any Commons rules by taking the freebie, but asked why he had spent the week at the junket instead of advising Mr Miliband on the floods, the frontbencher said he had been invited to give a speech on waste.\par \par \uc2 Pressed to say if had considered cancelling the trip because of the floods, he said: \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19ve given my reply, thank you.\u8217\'20\'19 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 And asked to explain his connection to Sigma and the pharmacy world, he said: \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19ve just told you.

And as he slapped on the sunscreen and adjusted his Panama hat, he seemed to have not a care in the world.\par \par \uc2 He enjoyed romantic walks along the beach with Caroline, his wife of 35 years, and delicious meals at Cancun\u8217\'20\'19s Moon Palace resort, including an all-you-can-eat buffet offering chilled lobster and a beachside seafood diner.\par \par \uc2 Earlier in the week, he wore an Indian-style shirt to celebrate \u8216\'20\'18Bollywood Night\u8217\'20\'19 and donned a tuxedo for a glittering black tie gala dinner.\par \par \uc2 The Gardiners were guests of Sigma boss and Labour party supporter Bharat Shah, who transformed his family-owned drug distributor into a multi-national company with an annual turnover of \u163\'00\'A3206\u8201\'20\'09million.\par \par \uc2 They stayed at the Sunrise Hotel in room 1945, a \u163\'00\'A3325-a-night suite complete with a sunken jacuzzi overlooking a lush garden filled with palms and bougainvillea.\par \par \uc2 The Gardiners were among 460 delegates \u8211\'20\'13 mostly from the UK\u160\'00\'A0 \u8211\'20\'13 at the resort which is described\u160\'00\'A0 as \u8216\'20\'18the most magnificent in all of Mexico\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, as the temperature topped 85F (29C) in the shade, the Gardiners hit the pool. The MP wore a colourful Hawaiian-print shirt with blue floral swimming shorts incongruously paired with brown lace-up leather shoes. A Panama hat completed the look.\par \par \uc2 He and Caroline circled the pool before choosing two orange\u160\'00\'A0 sun-loungers nestled under a \u8216\'20\'18palapa\u8217\'20\'19 \u8211\'20\'13 a sunshade made from dried palm fronds.\par \par \uc2 Caroline leapt enthusiastically into the pool to join a water aerobics class while her husband smiled and tapped his feet to the music as he gazed appreciatively at the bikini-clad bathers around him.\par \par \uc2 After reading his Kindle he stripped off his top and waded out into the main pool. He occasionally submerged himself and did a few breast-strokes, but mostly wallowed in the pristine water, closing his eyes at one stage and leaning back to soak up the sun.\par \par \uc2 A spot of lunch at the beachside fish restaurant was followed by a stroll along the sand with Caroline before they returned to their\u160\'00\'A0 sun-loungers for the afternoon.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday it was \u8216\'20\'18Bollywood Night\u8217\'20\'19 where the Gardiners tucked into a vegetarian buffet while Indian zither music played.

No one bothers with the lectures. You have to show your face over there at least once but most of the time the lecture hall is empty.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Business is done over drinks at the pool or cocktails in the evening.

\par\par \uc2 Observer New Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 THE RULES AN ETIQUETTE GUIDE TO SPEAKING OUT\b0\par\par\uc2 Rafael Behr   \par \uc2 664 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 46\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 When to speak out\par \par \uc2 When silence is no longer an option, it may be time for you to speak out. But it may also be time to give silence another try, especially if alcohol is involved. If you have drunk so much that it would not be legal to drive somewhere in order to speak out, assume that silence is in fact still an option.\par \par \uc2 Other times when it is appropriate to suppress the urge to speak out: when queuing for security at the airport; when provoked to outrage by something you have seen in the Daily Mail; when the person on the receiving end of your outrage is a low-ranking employee of the company or agency that has made you angry; when you are alone in the room.\par \par \uc2 Speaking out and free speech\par \par \uc2 Once it has been established that the time has come to speak out, make sure you choose the right grievance.\par \par \uc2 Some people struggle to make their voices heard. If you write newspaper columns bemoaning the demise of freedom of expression, you are not one of those people.\par \par \uc2 Headlines declaring that no one is allowed to debate a subject - usually \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - are a sign that debate on the subject has been mandatory for years.\par \par \uc2 If what you are speaking out against involves a shadowy network of international puppet-masters pulling the strings of government, do not waste your time trying to speak out through established mainstream media. They are in on it too.\par \par \uc2 Famous people speaking out\par \par \uc2 Celebrities sometimes like to speak out on issues they care about. These should not bear any relationship to issues they know about. (Thus David Bowie is entitled to speak out against Scottish independence and George Clooney can call for the Elgin marbles to be returned to the Parthenon.) Although these interventions may appear ridiculous, they are preferable to rock musicians and film stars speaking out against how much tax they have to pay.\par \par \uc2 Movie stars are sometimes appointed by the United Nations as special ambassadors. This bestows on them the power to have important issues mentioned briefly in italics at the end of the interviews they do when promoting their new films.\par \par \uc2 When nothing more vacuous or less helpful could be said by a famous person on a contentious topic, it is said to have crossed the Prince Charles threshold.\par \par \uc2 Religion and speaking out\par \par \uc2 Most religions encourage speaking out against injustice and wickedness, except when offences are perpetrated by clerics, in which case it becomes God's will that no one speak out. God's will can be very confusing. People who speak out against established religious authorities are usually heretics but, on occasion, may also be prophets. It all depends how many disciples they have. A prophet is a heretic who is good at sales.\par \par \uc2 Speaking out in church\par \par \uc2 If you do actually know of a reason why two people should not be lawfully married, raise it well in advance and in private rather than wait for that moment in the ceremony when the priest asks the congregation.\par \par \uc2 Good forums\par \par \uc2 Mid-morning television Easy questions from docile interviewers.\par \par \uc2 US presidential inaugural address The world is listening and you still have moral authority from not yet having invaded anyone.\par \par \uc2 Group therapy No one will criticise.\par \par \uc2 Not-so-good forums\par \par \uc2 The comments thread of national newspaper websites Foam-flecked hysteria is part of the deal; no one is taking anyone seriously apart from the people who take everything far too seriously.\par \par \uc2 Radio phone-ins Like the comment threads, but with a presenter who can cut you off.\par \par \uc2 The House of Commons Too much shouting; no one can hear you.\par \par \uc2 The House of Lords By the time you have made it here, anyone who cares what you have to say has heard you say it already.\par \par \uc2 Speakers' Corner There's a reason why it isn't called "listeners' corner".\par \par \uc2 Rafael Behr\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140222ea2n0001r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 This winter has seen two deluges. First, the never-ending rain and then the ceaseless torrent of words about Benefits Street. Although the series finished almost two weeks ago, the controversy has hardly subsided. Last week there was the optimistically titled Benefits Street: The Last Word, followed, as if to confirm the emptiness of that claim, by Benefits Britain: The Debate.\par \par \uc2 Channel 4's six-part documentary has been so divisive that, forget the show, people are still arguing over its name. The use of the word "benefits", say many commentators, has "demonised" those on benefits. I'm not sure of the logic of this argument. There should be no shame in claiming benefits if the claimants' circumstances entitle them to benefits.\par \par \uc2 And if the programme was focused on James Turner Street in Birmingham because the majority of its inhabitants were receiving benefits, then "Benefits Street" - rather than, say, "Marginalised and Socially Forgotten Street" - seems an appropriately snappy title to use.\par \par \uc2 But, ah, continued the critics, it suggests that all benefits claimants are like those on James Turner Street. I think most viewers are intelligent enough to realise that the programme was largely concerned with those who were in some sense trapped on benefits. In any case, the inhabitants who agreed to be filmed were mostly portrayed in a sympathetic light.\par \par \uc2 Far from demonising benefits claimants, Benefits Street humanised an alcoholic petty criminal (Fungi), highlighted the plight of Romanian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , and turned a coarse, overweight single mother (White Dee) into something of a national heroine.\par \par \uc2 Of course it did a lot of other things that documentaries of this nature tend to do. It bent time, excluded the unexceptional and created dramatic narratives out of the mess of mundane life. All of which is misleading but, in this business, not exactly immoral.\par \par \uc2 It was also uneven. At times it captured something authentic and hidden; at others it felt forced and false. One moment bold and brave, the next evasive, leaving you uncertain what the real story involved. But beyond all that it gave a voice to a sector of society that is much heard about but seldom heard from.\par \par \uc2 That included people such as Danny, the charmless thief with more than 80 convictions. "How can you live not knowing who lives next door?" asked Dee of those unfortunate enough to be housed in less community-spirited streets than James Turner. But with neighbours such as Danny the question could be asked: how can you live knowing who lives next door? Yet plenty of people do and, by and large, it's commendable how they got on with it.\par \par \uc2 Benefits Street: The Last Word was an anticlimax, a piece of Channel 4 self-backslapping, designed with the programme's critics in mind to inform us that no humans were harmed during the course of filming. Some of them had even found jobs. And the film- makers were at pains to reassure us that everyone had, as it were, benefited.\par \par \uc2 Benefits Britain: The Debate, if anything, contributed even less. A chaotic studio affair in which the participants looked either nervous, fanatical, or like they were seriously regretting their decision to take part (the columnist Allison Pearson left after clashing with another columnist, Owen Jones), it was an object lesson in how not to conduct an intelligent dialogue. Inevitably the argument divided along political lines, with the right maintaining that it was damaging to leave people dependent on benefits and the left insisting that the real culprits were the irresponsible bankers.\par \par \uc2 But surely it's possible to hold the opinion that irresponsible bankers should be held to account and that it's damaging to leave people dependent on benefits. I would be tempted to call it common sense if Jonathan Meades, the intelligentsia's very own Jake Blues, hadn't dismissed that concept as "the most dismal of characteristics" in Bunkers, Brutalism and Bloodymindedness\par \par \uc2 It was a characteristically Olympian judgment from one of the most intellectually stimulating cultural critics of our time. Even when he speaks nonsense - and he had his moments here - he does so in a manner that compels the viewer to think.\par \par \uc2 His contention was that we should not expect buildings to be pleasing to the eye. Nightmares, he argued, are more powerful than dreams. Perhaps, but no one wants to live in a nightmare, and the majority of the concrete blocks that marked second-generation modernism were indeed the stuff of bad dreams for the poor inhabitants who had to endure them.\par \par \uc2 Meades slapped down such bourgeois sentimentality, claiming that concrete council blocks of the 1960s and 70s, which he acknowledged had been inspired by Nazi military bunkers, had been falsely blamed for every dysfunction from shoplifting to drug addiction. One only has to survey the prim terraces of James Turner Street to realise that no architecture has a monopoly on social problems.\par \par \uc2 But Meades went much further. And in attempting to position architects as artists who have no responsibility other than to their muse, he may have resembled a rebellious, Ray-Banned, black-suited John Belushi. The worrying thing, however, was that he sounded like Ayn Rand.\par \par \uc2 Another week, another forensically well-made serial-killing cop show. True Detective starred major Hollywood budget-bait Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey as ill-matched detectives investigating a weirdo murder in Louisiana in 1995 and then reflecting on the case 17 years later.\par \par \uc2 It was moody and edgy and shot through with unsettling dialogue, not all of it audible to someone who isn't fluent in mumbling and drawling. "I can smell the psychospace," said McConaughey's hyper-intense character. At least I think that's what he said. And I sort of knew what he meant. I just wish the odorous psychospace didn't always have to feature the naked, mutilated corpse of a woman.\par \par \uc2 That gripe aside, it looks utterly gripping.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 hdsghlkdhg dsjkglh dkjhgjsdhg jhadljg jdhgjkhsd\par \par \uc2 Mark Thomas and Becky Howe with their children Calum and Casey, residents of James Turner Street, aka Benefits Street.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140222ea2n0004w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The wider demonisation of Romanian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to the UK has fuelled longstanding negative attitudes to the Roma, in particular, as work-shy thieves and troublemakers. Most seem to assume the two are one and the same, though Roma make up under 5 per cent of Romanians. Stories last year about Roma "stealing" babies in Greece and Ireland proved groundless, but our ready acceptance of them revealed how deep-rooted are the myths we have all inherited.\par \par \uc2 Yaron Matras has spent many years getting to know inward-looking Roma communities across Europe, unravelling their history, language and customs from origins in India. It is an ancient and rich culture he describes, passed on largely through the oral tradition, hence some of the confusion (for example, Matras shows how most Roma prefer to stay in one place, not roam). But it is also a history of scapegoating and marginalisation of a people considered "other".\par \par \uc2 The parallels with the treatment of the Jews are clear, but whereas the Holocaust shocked Europe into examining its conscience on anti-Semitism, even the murder of between 100,000 and 1.5 million Roma by the Nazis (depending on which estimate you take) has done little to exorcise our prejudices. Matras's immaculately researched study is a challenge belatedly to make a start.

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Co-op's lost plot, specs for snoopers, lessons in domestic service\b0\par\par\uc2 Janet Street-Porter EDITOR AT LARGE   \par \uc2 1,190 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par \uc2 Independent On Sunday\par \uc2 INDOS\par \uc2 1ST\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 News | JSP\par \par \uc2 My experience of the Co-op began the minute I could be trusted to go to the shops. Mum taught me our "divi" number, as that was where we bought most of our supplies. It's still imprinted on my mind - 354735. Sadly, visiting my local Co-op in Yorkshire has become a dispiriting experience; the charming small premises were closed and a larger characterless box opened around the corner. The stock seemed to have mysteriously shrunk apart from the space devoted to booze, frozen food and magazines, which is huge. I can't find any "local" produce, in an area renowned for meat, pies, jams, and delicious cheese. In short, my Co-op could be in Barnsley or Bradford, just another convenience store with little in the way of cleaning products or shoe polish. Why does the Co-op want to emulate \uc2 Tesco\uc2 ? It's not just the grocery sector (where sales have flat-lined, hit by \uc2 Aldi\uc2  and \uc2 Lidl\uc2 , and profits for 2013 are predicted to be "grim") that's suffering, the Co-op Bank has a massive \u163\'00\'A3462m shortfall.\par \par \uc2 The chief executive \uc2 Euan Sutherland\uc2  has to sort out its finances in the wake of the \uc2 Paul Flowers\uc2  scandal, when it appeared that someone with minimal banking experience (but an alleged taste for recreational drugs) had been appointed chairman. Sutherland is asking the public for advice, spending \u163\'00\'A3100,000 on what has been described as "the largest piece of research and engagement in history" \u8230\'20\'26 an online survey that will run until 24 March. It took me 20 minutes to complete and seems more bothered with funding clubs and yoga classes than the lack of cashiers and paltry stock in the stores. I was asked to describe the Co-op in one word - after pondering on "lacklustre" I chose "directionless". I wish the Co-op would stop agonising about whether to support political parties and focus on its core business, retailing. Even so, there's a lot the main parties could learn from this survey before they write their manifestos.\par \par \uc2 Orwellian times\par \par \uc2 I enjoyed the new production of 1984 at the Almeida theatre, although it felt a bit like a school outing to the production of a set book - so many of the catchphrases have been filched by media types including yours truly, they've lost their shock value. I wonder what Big Brother (the telly version) devotees would make of this enterprise? It's beautifully executed, but is the message still relevant? Orwell's nightmare of constant surveillance has come to pass; we are filmed every minute, on public transport, driving, shopping and on most high streets. Mobile phones have replaced cameras as we spend more time recording each other (and ourselves) than enjoying primary experiences (like sport or art).\par \par \uc2 An even more insidious form of surveillance has arrived: \uc2 Google\uc2  glasses (above), which allow wearers to browse the internet and record what's happening around them. A few thousand people have paid nearly \u163\'00\'A31,000 for a prototype of the device, and they have already been nicknamed "glassholes" for creepy behaviour. \uc2 Google\uc2  has issued an "etiquette" guide, suggesting that wearers ask permission before recording others, stating that "standing alone in the corner of a room staring at people while recording them through Glass is not going to win you any friends". It's too late to get bothered, we lost our privacy years ago. \uc2 Google\uc2  glasses are the ultimate gadget for sad nerds.\par \par \uc2 Fiennes on fine form\par \par \uc2 The latest Wes Anderson film Grand Hotel Budapest was premiered at the Berlin Film Festival and opens here on 7 March. Ralph Fiennes is on top form as Gustave H (above, right), the hospitality industry's most eccentric concierge, for whom nothing (including sexual favours to old ladies) is too much trouble. The film is sublime, but I can't reveal any more, and in case critics at the screening I attended were tempted to record anything, all our mobile devices were collected and sealed in bags. Afterwards, we handed in numbered tickets to claim them back. A bit annoying, but maybe West End theatres should adopt this tactic, as modern audiences seem to think it's OK to text and read emails throughout a performance.\par \par \uc2 Wes Anderson has said he was partly inspired by Stefan Zweig's tragic novel The Post Office Girl, set in 1926, but only published in English in 2008. It tells the story of a humble clerk invited to stay in a grand hotel by her aunt, visiting from America. When the girl's true identity becomes known, she gets sent packing in case the Aunt's true background is uncovered by the snobbish clientele. I can't recommend it enough.\par \par \uc2 The servant problem\par \par \uc2 One in four households now has servants, paid to carry out tasks we haven't the time or can't be bothered to do, according to a survey. Since the recession, more homes have three or more generations living together. In spite of this, more homes now hire in labour than in Victorian times; in 1870, one in six homes had paid help.\par \par \uc2 So who are all these modern-day servants enabling us to emulate the toffs in Downton (below)? According to Frank Field, who advised David Cameron on poverty, they are immigrants willing to work for the minimum wage who have no qualms about doing menial tasks. The Home Office admits the number of Brits taking lower-skilled jobs has been falling over the past decade, while the number of foreign nationals has risen. If the servant class is a buoyant jobs market, how do we encourage young working-class Brits to change their mindsets?\par \par \uc2 Frank Field says it's hard to justify paying benefits for an indefinite period if they live in an area where there are plenty of jobs. Why not redesign the last couple of years at school for non-academic kids, preparing them for work, teaching social skills, mentoring them and showing that the minimum wage is just a starting point. Cutting off benefit sounds brutal, but unless there's a radical rethink, foreign workers will soon take all these jobs. Young people need training to be ready for work, and it's got to start at 15 or 16 if we're keeping them at school until 18.\par \par \uc2 Bernie's a Vlad fan\par \par \uc2 Bernie Ecclestone is not a man I'd like to meet in a lift. He might be short of stature, but he's big on bigotry, having once described Hitler as a man "able to get things done". Speaking to a news channel about the first Sochi Grand Prix, to be held in October, he agreed with President Putin that homosexuality should not be "publicised to an audience under the age of 18" \u8230\'20\'26 adding "if you took a world census you'd find that 90 per cent of the world agree". Do the Formula One directors not find Mr Ecclestone's opinions as repugnant as I do?\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @The_Real_JSP\par \par \uc2 Document INDOS00020140223ea2n00023\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Not on our hymn sheet\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nick Ferrari   \par \uc2 1,190 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par 00:01\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 I WONDER if David Cameron feels he has had a touch of the King Henry\u8217\'20\'19s after a week of \u8220\'20\'1Cturbulent priests" lining up to attack him for his programme of cuts and his Coalition\u8217\'20\'19s attempts to reform the welfare system.\par \par \uc2 This modern Church versus state row was kicked off by the most senior Roman Catholic in England and Wales, the Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols. Before being made a Cardinal in Rome, the Archbishop embarked on a round of media interviews in which he made plain his concern at the level of the Government\u8217\'20\'19s cuts. While he broadly accepted that budgetary control was needed, he spoke out about how the genuinely needy and vulnerable had been largely ignored.\par \par \uc2 He said that the changes had left many in \u8220\'20\'1Chunger and destitution" and accused politicians of all parties of a \u8220\'20\'1Clack of leadership", saying that he had been saddened and \u8220\'20\'1Cinundated" with messages from people fraught with worry over the cuts. The Prime Minister, however, was not for moving. His reforms, he said, are \u8220\'20\'1Cabout doing what is right" and he likened it to a moral duty to get people who were \u8220\'20\'1Ctrapped in a cycle of dependency" into work and said it was wrong to \u8220\'20\'1Creward" those who can work but choose not to.\par \par \uc2 Take a trip to any town or city centre at the time of the day when people should be at work and you will see for yourself how the PM has got this one spot on. There are hordes of young and fit people trudging aimlessly through shopping centres pushing prams brimming with children and cheap toys and screaming at poorly behaved toddlers who are dancing around the dreary procession like handmaidens. Their eyes are glazed over, they are bereft of ambition or aspiration and fill their \u160\'00\'A0existences with benefit payments, cheap lager and daytime TV.\par \par \uc2 There is no denying that there is a small minority of folk who are genuinely on struggle street but Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s case was massively boosted by the employment figures that came out this week at the peak of the row between Cameron and the clergy. In the past three months of last year, 125,000 people found work and before any bed-wetting leftie starts bleating about the jobs being only part time, they should study it in more detail. Most of these jobs were full time or self-employed and the number of part-time jobs is falling rapidly. Indeed, the creation of self-employed opportunities is booming and the percentage rate of women in work, at more than 67 per cent, is the best on record.\par \par \uc2 What do you suppose the complaining clerics think lies behind this? It is not down to saying matins every day but rather people who were coasting on a life on benefits being nudged, or sometimes shoved, into work. In other words, a government doing what is right: giving its people hope and purpose by getting them to work.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, as the week progressed other clergy \u8220\'20\'1Cflocked" to support the Archbishop\u8217\'20\'19s view and show they were one psalm short of a hymn book. A total of 27 Anglican bishops and 15 other faith leaders signed an open letter attacking the Coalition for the \u8220\'20\'1Cnational crisis" it has created and saying that the PM has a \u8220\'20\'1Cmoral duty" to alleviate the suffering they claim he has created.\par \par \uc2 Sadly, this divine intervention is as misjudged as the destinations so many churches have for all the money their congregations raise. In an Anglican church in Kent all the money that is raised is sent to Eastern Europe, in a Catholic church in Hertfordshire it all goes to Africa and another Catholic church in London has been trying to strong-arm parishioners into pledging large sums of money by writing cheques, sometimes for thousands of pounds.\par \par \uc2 This is no isolated example. The chances are that if you are relaxing by reading this after attending service this morning, the posters on the notice board all boasted about the money raised for causes overseas.\par \par \uc2 With half a million people here visiting food banks since last Easter, any \u8220\'20\'1Cmoral duty" is surely for the church to look after those closest to it. Never mind helping those in Haiti, how about a handout for those on their own high street? Let the clergy stick to saving souls and the Government to trying to save the cash.\par \par \uc2 ........................................................................\par \par \uc2 Sports Minister Helen Grant has said girls are put off playing sport because they hate getting sweaty and looking \u8220\'20\'1Cunfeminine". she suggests, therefore, they should focus on ballet, roller-skating and cheerleading as they can then look \u8220\'20\'1Cradiant".\par \par \uc2 It is a good job this dopey minister, who is also Conservative MP for Maidstone and The Weald, is a woman. Could you imagine the storm of manufactured fury had it been a man behind these asinine views?\par \par \uc2 ........................................................................\par \par \uc2 WITHOUT question, David Bowie is a music legend, one of those rare, multi-talented geniuses who come along on only a handful of occasions in a lifetime and is fully deserving of his Brit Award last week.\par \par \uc2 However, for the love of all that is Holy, why do these undoubted musical superstars think they can use their unbelievable sound of music as a platform to preach? Down the years they have lectured us on just about everything from the rights of Amazonian Indians to the plight of badgers and climate change to vegetarianism.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Bowie\u8217\'20\'19s sermon, randomly delivered by Kate Moss, wearing one of the singer\u8217\'20\'19s catsuits, was about the Scottish vote on independence.\par \par \uc2 Guys, just stick to belting out the hits. Otherwise, a scenario in which Messrs Clegg, Cameron and Miliband are vying for number one could be the flip side. And, as Bowie knows, they would be Absolute Beginners.\par \par \uc2 ........................................................................\par \par \uc2 WHILE it behoves me to say I told you so, can I just say the news that the hideous \uc2 NHS\uc2  Care Data Programme is to be delayed is not surprising.\par \par \uc2 This was an ill thought out, obtrusive, boorish attempt to harvest data about us on everything from ingrowing toenails to insanity and was plain wrong. Red-faced \uc2 NHS\uc2  England bosses say more time is required to sell the scheme to the public.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Hardly. This scheme is sick and is not deserving of resuscitation.\par \par \uc2 ........................................................................\par \par \uc2 SO THE children of Chinese cleaners score higher in educational attainment than the children of British middle-class families. Why is anyone surprised? When we allowed education to be hijacked by the loony \u8220\'20\'1Cno one is ever a winner" brigade, surely we knew an era of underachievement was being ushered in?\par \par \uc2 ........................................................................\par \par \uc2 FOUR members of an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  child sex gang convicted of raping and sexually assaulting girls, some as young as 12, are from the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Their crimes earned them sentences of up to 20 years. In the view of Judge John Bevan QC, one is a \u8220\'20\'1Cbully with an overgrown sexual appetite". We are powerless to boot these vile perverts out of the country when they are freed courtesy of their rights as Europeans. When can we have that vote?\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140223ea2n0011i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Cameron aims to get close to Market with \uc2 immigration\uc2  talks\b0\par\par\uc2 TIM ROSS   \par \uc2 821 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 DAVID CAMERON\uc2  will open talks on overhauling European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rules with \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2 , the German chancellor, during her official visit to Britain this week.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister is seeking to build an alliance of "like-minded countries" that are willing to reform the rules on "free movement" of people inside the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 His aides hope that Mrs Merkel, leader of the most powerful country in the EU, will offer some support for his aims during her one-day trip to London on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 In a sign of how important the chancellor is to British hopes of reforming the EU, she is being given the rare honour of addressing both Houses of Parliament in the ornate Royal Gallery in the House of Lords, before taking lunch at No10 and having tea with the Queen.\par \par \uc2 Her visit is being seen as evidence of the increasingly close alliance between the chancellor and Mr Cameron. In a further sign of the growing ties between the two leaders, the Prime Minister will travel to Germany to co-host a trade fair with Mrs Merkel next month, at her invitation.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is likely to be the most controversial topic for discussion over lunch in Downing Street, as Mr Cameron seeks her support for a tougher line in an attempt to pacify his Eurosceptic MPs and neutralise the threat to the Conservatives from the UK Independence Party.\par \par \uc2 "We are trying to get a group of like-minded countries together to do some specific work on what the options would be to tighten the rules," a government source said. "Merkel's visit is an opportunity to start those discussions."\par \par \uc2 Sources said talks on reforming European free movement rules would focus on concerns over "benefits abuse" by EU migrants and the need for stronger transitional controls on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from new member states.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron has called for sweeping reforms to the EU's founding principle of "free movement", under which citizens are able to move within the EU to work without the need for a visa.\par \par \uc2 Britain has raised concerns, with a number of countries that the current rules are open to abuse, allowing people to travel to the UK simply to claim benefits.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Commission\uc2  has reacted furiously to Mr Cameron's suggestion that limits should be placed on free movement rights, accusing the UK of becoming a "nasty" country. Without German support, any change to the current rules on EU migration would be impossible.\par \par \uc2 British sources suggested they were hopeful that Mrs Merkel, who is also under pressure over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  domestically, would show her willingness to support tighter rules on when migrants can claim benefits. She is believed to be ready to consider Mr Cameron's suggestion that stronger "transitional controls" on migration should be introduced when a country joins the EU.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister is expected to urge her to back the idea that citizens from new member states should not in future be able to move to other countries for work until certain conditions have been met, to avoid an influx of cheap labour.\par \par \uc2 Fears were raised that the lifting of transitional controls for Romanian and Bulgarian citizens at the beginning of this year would result in thousands of people coming to Britain looking for work.\par \par \uc2 Figures last week suggested that Romanians and Bulgarians took one in 10 new jobs in 2013, while the number living in Britain rose 42 per cent in a year to 144,000 people.\par \par \uc2 During her visit, Mrs Merkel is expected to meet Nick Clegg, the pro-European Deputy Prime Minister, and Ed Miliband, the Labour leader.\par \par \uc2 The discussions at No10 are expected to be the most "informal" part of her trip, as the two leaders know each other well and have built up a rapport. Mr Cameron and his family were the personal guests of Mrs Merkel last year, staying at the 18th century country castle, Schloss Meseberg.\par \par \uc2 She stayed at Chequers, the Prime Minister's country residence, in 2010.\par \par \uc2 The agenda for lunch will include the evolving situation in Ukraine, as well as wider reforms to the EU, such as improving competitiveness and new measures to "repatriate" powers from Brussels to individual member states.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron has promised to negotiate a new deal for Britain's membership of the EU and put the results to a national vote in a referendum on whether to remain in the EU, if the Conservatives win next year's election.\par \par \uc2 British sources hope Mrs Merkel will publicly embrace his reformist agenda during a planned press conference at No10, before she travels to Buckingham Palace.\par \par \uc2 Her most challenging task on the day may be to remain standing for her address to the assembled MPs and peers in Parliament's Royal Gallery. Mrs Merkel is still using crutches after fracturing her pelvis in a skiing accident in Switzerland last month.\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140223ea2n0008p\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Louise Mensch\par \b \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s easy to beat waster to a job if he\u8217\'20\'19s on couch; THERE was a strong reaction to my column on White Dee last week \u8212\'20\'14 after which the \u8220\'20\'1Cdepressed" star did two MORE TV interviews.\b0\par\par\uc2 By LOUISE MENSCH   \par \uc2 1,206 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par 02:10\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 But Dee won\u8217\'20\'19t be too happy to find she\u8217\'20\'19s even more out of sync with the average British woman. We\u8217\'20\'19re grafting harder than ever, as new figures out this week show a massive surge in women\u8217\'20\'19s jobs.\par \par \uc2 In the year after Maggie Thatcher died, more British women are in work than at any time since records began in 1971 \u8212\'20\'14 the year I was born. There are 14million of us bringing home the bacon \u8212\'20\'14 and usually frying it up afterwards too.\par \par \uc2 If we don\u8217\'20\'19t want to raise a nation of White Dees, we must tackle youth unemployment. Too many kids are sitting at home on benefits when they could be and should be working.\par \par \uc2 If you start out with bad habits, you\u8217\'20\'19re unlikely to get out of that comfortable welfare trap. There are lots of options \u8212\'20\'14 figures show there\u8217\'20\'19s part-time work in micro or mini jobs.\par \par \uc2 Young people need to get that habit good and early \u8212\'20\'14 so they can wind up like their hard-working mums \u8212\'20\'14 and not Dee\u8217\'20\'19s friends on Benefits Street.\par \par \uc2 When I was a teenager I had to work a Saturday job if I wanted an allowance. I won\u8217\'20\'19t lie, I bloody hated it.\par \par \uc2 Standing in a clothes shop in Wadhurst, Sussex, folding \u8220\'20\'1Csnazzy" sweatshirts and bored out of my mind. After that it was a bookshop, which I thought would be great, but I was bored there too (no reading on the job).\par \par \uc2 But it taught me you have to work if you want money. Today, young Brits on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  ask me why they should be compelled to work for their benefits if the job\u8217\'20\'19s not \u8220\'20\'1Cfulfilling".\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CDepressed" Dee herself said on TV last week she couldn\u8217\'20\'19t work as she\u8217\'20\'19d have to call in sick if she was \u8220\'20\'1Cfeeling down". How many of us don\u8217\'20\'19t \u8220\'20\'1Cfeel down" on a Monday morning traipsing in to work?\par \par \uc2 Labour MP Frank Field admitted there\u8217\'20\'19s a \u8220\'20\'1Cservant class" of Romanians and Bulgarians \u8220\'20\'1Cbeating" young Britons to jobs.\par \par \uc2 But don\u8217\'20\'19t blame the \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 it\u8217\'20\'19s easy to beat a young waster to a job when he doesn\u8217\'20\'19t get off his couch. Ten per cent of all new jobs last year went to these hard workers. Too many young Brits just don\u8217\'20\'19t want to serve coffee or work for the minimum wage.\par \par \uc2 Field says we should SLASH benefits to young people after a much shorter time.\par \par \uc2 I agree with him. These youngsters are fit and able \u8212\'20\'14 but not willing. All too often the under-25s start out drinking and loafing on the dole, then become deeply depressed \u8212\'20\'14 and after that, unemployable.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19ll soon be spring, when hard-working mother birds kick grown-up chicks out of the nest to force them to fly. Maybe that\u8217\'20\'19s not such a bad idea for Britain either.\par \par \uc2 And as for those young Romanians snapping up low-paying jobs \u8212\'20\'14 at least if they settle here and have children, those new Britons will see two parents with a work ethic.\par \par \uc2 Leash this menace\par \par \uc2 Tragic Eliza-Mae\par \par \uc2 THE latest tragedy was almost too much to bear. A dog bought in a pub comes home and allegedly savages to death six-day-old Eliza-Mae Mullane.\par \par \uc2 What\u8217\'20\'19s it going to take to get tougher laws on dangerous dogs? Vets say NEVER leave a pet with a child \u8211\'20\'13 but it happens all too often. Last year, 11-month-old Ava-Jayne Corless was savaged to death by a pitbull her stepdad brought home.\par \par \uc2 Here in America, a woman with cats was savaged to death by two of her neighbour\u8217\'20\'19s dogs \u8211\'20\'13 which she had complained about to police nine times. Usually I\u8217\'20\'19m against bureaucracy, but we need some red tape to leash this menace.\par \par \uc2 Warnings aren\u8217\'20\'19t enough. It should be a criminal offence to leave your dog alone with a young child.\par \par \uc2 All breeds known to be aggressive, not just banned ones, should come with statutory guidelines. And it should be compulsory to neuter male dogs unless you are a registered breeder. It reduces their aggressiveness.\par \par \uc2 More than that, we need the law on irresponsible dog owners toughened up.\par \par \uc2 Much stiffer fines are called for, or tough community service.\par \par \uc2 How about a month or two cleaning up dog mess?\par \par \uc2 Showcase of shame\par \par \uc2 I KNOW a Ukranian lady from the pro-Russian part of the country who tells me there is only one reason Putin hasn\u8217\'20\'19t poured the tanks into the capital Kiev \u8211\'20\'13 he\u8217\'20\'19s bound by the Olympic truce.\par \par \uc2 This was the pledge he made, calling for world peace during the Winter Games.\par \par \uc2 I bet he regrets that now.\par \par \uc2 Sochi itself is turning out to be vladdy awful for the Russian President \u8211\'20\'13 not the Putin propaganda triumph he wanted. We cringed at tales of bulldozed houses, arrested protesters, mass government hacking and the shooting of stray dogs. Then we laughed our heads off at the viral photos of #SochiProblems, showing the crumbling disaster that is Putin\u8217\'20\'19s Russia.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the Games themselves open with one ring missing \u8211\'20\'13 and they stink to high heaven, with the Russian stitch-up in awarding the figure skating gold to one of their own just the latest example.\par \par \uc2 From before the Games started to the very end, these multi-billion Olympics have made Putin and Russia a laughing stock.\par \par \uc2 So I guess there is some justice in stinking Sochi.\par \par \uc2 Cheer for sporting choice\par \par \uc2 Golden girl Lizzy Yarnold Getty\par \par \uc2 SPORTS minister Helen Grant was a champ for women this week.\par \par \uc2 Fifty per cent of girls drop out of voluntary PE by the age of 14 \u8211\'20\'13 and it gets worse as they get older. Why? A lack of \u8220\'20\'1Cfeminine" sports and too much sweating makes them feel uncomfortable and unattractive.\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s what the girls themselves say. But when Helen said girls should be free to choose more feminine sports, the Left predictably went nuts. Since when did \u8220\'20\'1Cfeminine" become a derogatory term?\par \par \uc2 Paralympic rowing champ Pam Relph added: \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m proud to have been a \u8216\'20\'18feminine\u8217\'20\'19 cheerleader. The women were strong and athletic."\par \par \uc2 Despite Left-wing rage, boys will be boys and girls \u8211\'20\'13 like Sochi skeleton champ Lizzy Yarnold \u8211\'20\'13 will be girls. We should cheerlead for choice!\par \par \uc2 Police the pop pickers\par \par \uc2 SO the Brit awards were a drug-addled haze.\par \par \uc2 We had James Corden on stage making jokes about the amount of cocaine going down backstage, while Boy George said he could hear celebs sniffing away in the loos.\par \par \uc2 Gossip aside, we have to ask why there is one rule for rich, famous people and another for poor folk on the street.\par \par \uc2 Philip Seymour Hoffman died of a heroin overdose \u8211\'20\'13 and when he did, the great and good were lining up to lecture us about the evils of drugs.\par \par \uc2 If we want to be fair in society, police should be on hand for all these things \u8211\'20\'13 wandering backstage at the Brits, the Grammys and, yes, the Oscars too.\par \par \uc2 Document THESUK0020140223ea2n001p7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 It's easy to beat waster to a job if he's on couch\b0\par\par\uc2 LOUISE MENSCH   \par \uc2 554 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par \uc2 The Sun\par \uc2 THESUN\par \uc2 1; National\par 29\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 THERE was a strong reaction to my column on White Dee last week \u8212\'20\'14 after which the "depressed" star did two MORE TV interviews.\par \par \uc2 But Dee won't be too happy to find she's even more out of sync with the average British woman. We're grafting harder than ever, as new figures out this week show a massive surge in women's jobs.\par \par \uc2 In the year after Maggie Thatcher died, more British women are in work than at any time since records began in 1971 \u8212\'20\'14 the year I was born. There are 14million of us bringing home the bacon \u8212\'20\'14 and usually frying it up afterwards too.\par \par \uc2 If we don't want to raise a nation of White Dees, we must tackle youth unemployment. Too many kids are sitting at home on benefits when they could be and should be working.\par \par \uc2 If you start out with bad habits, you're unlikely to get out of that comfortable welfare trap. There are lots of options \u8212\'20\'14 figures show there's part-time work in micro or mini jobs.\par \par \uc2 Young people need to get that habit good and early \u8212\'20\'14 so they can wind up like their hardworking mums \u8212\'20\'14 and not Dee's friends on Benefits Street.\par \par \uc2 When I was a teenager I had to work a Saturday job if I wanted an allowance. I won't lie, I bloody hated it.\par \par \uc2 Standing in a clothes shop in Wadhurst, Sussex, folding "snazzy" sweatshirts and bored out of my mind. After that it was a bookshop, which I thought would be great, but I was bored there too (no reading on the job).\par \par \uc2 But it taught me you have to work if you want money. Today, young Brits on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  ask me why they should be compelled to work for their benefits if the job's not "fulfilling".\par \par \uc2 Don't blame the \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  "Depressed" Dee herself said on TV last week she couldn't work as she'd have to call in sick if she was "feeling down". How many of us don't "feel down" on a Monday morning traipsing in to work? Labour MP Frank Field admitted there's a "servant class" of Romanians and Bulgarians "beating" young Britons to jobs.\par \par \uc2 But don't blame the \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 it's easy to beat a young waster to a job when he doesn't get off his couch. Ten per cent of all new jobs last year went to these hard workers. Too many young Brits just don't want to serve coffee or work for the minimum wage.\par \par \uc2 Field says we should SLASH benefits to young people after a much shorter time.\par \par \uc2 I agree with him. These youngsters are fit and able \u8212\'20\'14 but not willing.

Maybe that's not such a bad idea for Britain either.\par \par \uc2 And as for those young Romanians snapping up lowpaying jobs \u8212\'20\'14 at least if they settle here and have children, those new Britons will see two parents with a work ethic.\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140223ea2n00099\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

IT'S A CROSS I HAVE TO BEAR'\b0\par\par\uc2 Emma Jones   \par \uc2 867 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Mirror\par \uc2 SMIRR\par \uc2 1; National\par 18,19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Mirror Group Ltd   \par \par \uc2 The actor, 40, on working with hot ladies, filming in Paradise and how My Family got him noticed in some very strange places\par \par \uc2 2002\par \par \uc2 Keira Knightley and me getting married in Doctor Zhivago. I worked with Keira INLOVE Actually too. In that I was a waiter at her wedding, here I'm marrying her. A huge wedding theme with us two, but I always knew she'd be a star. This was a brilliant job as it's so iconic. I'm wearing a wig - we shot the end first and my character has bad alopecia, so I had to have these bald patches shaved into my hair. After that I just shaved my head, but it looked even worse. It took months for it to grow back. I had to wear a hat for ages. I was in Portugal a few months later in 30\u186\'00\'BA heat, in a woolly hat.\par \par \uc2 2001\par \par \uc2 Someone grabbed a rug and staged an impromptu photo shoot when we were rehearsing the first series of My Family. I was 27 when I started playing Nick, who was supposed to be 19. It was like a real family. I get recognised for this role all over the world, especially Africa. They go crazy for it. I was stopped by an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  guard and thought, 'What have I done?' But he just said, 'I loved you as Nick.' I was chuffed! Very surreal having border control in Nairobi complimenting your work.\par \par \uc2 2002\par \par \uc2 Heath Ledger and I bonded while filming The Four Feathers in the middle of the Australian desert. Heath (centre) had the villa behind me so we used to play poker and hang out a lot. Rupert Penry-Jones, too - we were all like-minded guys. It was cool. We were great friends and I was devastated when he passed away. When I see pictures of us together I think back to when people thought he was a pretty boy with no talent. Then his career went mad. So he reminds me people are quick to judge. It was great to have that time.\par \par \uc2 NB: Death In Paradise, BBC1, Tuesday, 9pm\par \par \uc2 2007 I was a gooseberry while doing the play there were only three of us.\par \par \uc2 And it's where Billie Piper and Laurence Fox met. Third wheel, much? I'm joking, we all had a great time together. We travelled round the country performing it and all hired a cottage and stayed together. It's great now they're married with kids. We look boozy, but this was at the start of the night. We didn't get that lashed as we had to do a matin\u233\'00\'E9e the next day. You want to get hammered after a performance, but you usually can't.\par \par \uc2 2003\par \par \uc2 In no way did I think Love Actually would become such a cult classic. Pretty much every British actor ever is in it, but I never realised it would be so huge. This was a brilliant day filming. Richard Curtis was never precious about his script. And this scene is so improvised. Everything where they're asking me to say things in my accent, we just made it all up on the day. The classic line 'And he's got a big kn*b!' was just a one-off line I threw in. Elisha Cuthbert was obviously in 24 and January Jones is in Mad Men. This pub is actually in Shepperton, we just turned it into Milwaukee. They were great, we all had a lot of fun. Just don't feel sorry for me hanging out with all these fit women, it's a cross I have to bear.\par \par \uc2 2014\par \par \uc2 Filming Death In Paradise in the Caribbean is the luckiest job in TV. But it's unbearably hot. I wear a vest, a shirt and a jacket and it's usually above 40\u186\'00\'BA, so trying to remember lines with sweat dripping down your back isn't easy. But I feel bad complaining - we have production meetings in the sea, it's hilarious. The worst thing is the centipedes, some are over a foot long. I saw an enormous one once, so I put my boots on and jumped on it four times to kill it! It was dramatic.\par \par \uc2 2012\par \par \uc2 My wife Hannah and I got my wife Hannah and I got married quite quickly then had a proper party later on. We didn't want an official photographer or anything fancy, just the hotel near where we both grew up, our best mates and our family. Then we got the snow, which was amazing! But of course some woman who was out shopping took these pictures and the next thing you know they're online everywhere! Being a dad is the best thing in the world too. I don't like spending too much time away from my son, Luca who is 18 months. Now we have a child the romance is certainly harder, but I work on it. I'm very downto-earth, but the one perk to being well-known? Doing one job then getting six months off.\par \par \uc2 Document SMIRR00020140223ea2n00078\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

Meanwhile, his rich housing spokesman rakes in \u163\'00\'A3745,000 from his tenants... and they include migrants on benefits\b0\par\par\uc2 NICK SOMMERLAD   \par \uc2 685 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Mirror\par \uc2 SMIRR\par \uc2 1; National\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Mirror Group Ltd   \par \par \uc2 UKIP'S housing spokesman is making a fortune off migrant tenants on benefits - despite Nigel Farage calling for a ban on foreigners claiming welfare.\par \par \uc2 Multi-millionaire landlord Andrew Charalambous has pocketed \u163\'00\'A3745,351 in housing benefit from occupants, who he admits include \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It will heap embarrassment on party leader Mr Farage and comes after Mr Charalambous described \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  as a "massive factor in the overcrowding of social housing".\par \par \uc2 He also demanded "priority be given to British families and those who contributed to the system".\par \par \uc2 When Mr Charalambous was asked whether he was a hypocrite over his massive haul, he said: "Not at all. We don't want to get into any business of questioning where people come from. That would be totally unfair.\par \par \uc2 "We operate in an area that is largely a migrant population. From a commercial point of view and a human point of view, we are not concerned about what the ethnic origin of the tenants is."\par \par \uc2 demand He also said he was an "ethical" landlord but refused to confirm how many properties he owned.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether he was profiting from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , he said: "\b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  has not only fuelled demand but has fuelled price. I think that's true."\par \par \uc2 Our investigation with \uc2 union GMB\uc2  found his firm Woodlands Estates Limited got the \u163\'00\'A3745,315 benefit cash through \uc2 Haringey Council\uc2 , in North London, last year - more than any other private landlord.\par \par \uc2 But the true figure is higher as it does not include benefit paid by the council to his tenants before they passed the money to Woodlands.\par \par \uc2 Last month leader Mr Farage called for new migrants to be banned from getting welfare handouts for five years after arriving in this country.\par \par \uc2 He said: "We must be completely mad, as a country, to be giving people from Eastern Europe in-work benefits."\par \par \uc2 But buy-to-let tycoon Mr Charalambous, who has stood in a by-election to try to become UKIP's first MP, said he would continue to accept migrants as tenants "as long as they are legally entitled to claim benefits". Wealthy Mr Charalambous went on: "If the law is going to change, then we work within the parameters of the law."\par \par \uc2 He said that almost one in six of his tenants were recent migrants to the UK but insisted the rest had British passports, which they got through relatives or because they had been in the country for a number of years.\par \par \uc2 He said: "We live in a country which obviously lots of people want to move to. We shouldn't stop people coming here for a better life. If people want to come here to contribute, we need to be open minded about that.\par \par \uc2 "But we need a way of saying 'look this is where we draw the line'."\par \par \uc2 But furious GMB General Secretary Paul Kenny said: "Housing hypocrite Charalambous blames foreigners for Britain's housing crisis while he receives millions of taxpayers' money in rent subsidies.\par \par \uc2 "Public money raised from hard-pressed families going to landlords such as Charalambous has to be stopped with a building programme of new council housing for rent." Mr Charalambous donated \u163\'00\'A3146,000 to the Tories before defecting to UKIP and was pictured cosying up to Margaret Thatcher at a swanky party at a London hotel in 2008.\par \par \uc2 He has twice tried and failed to be elected as an MP, as a Tory candidate in 2010 and for UKIP in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Nicknamed "Dr Earth", he has opened an "ecological" nightclub, describes himself as a "tantric master" and claims to have "dated some of the most beautiful women in the world".\par \par \uc2 He began investing in properties in 1994 and now owns hundreds in the capital, including "most" of those rented out by Woodlands. He insisted: "It's to our credit that we accept tenants that other landlords wouldn't accept. They are people that otherwise wouldn't get housing."\par \par \uc2 scoops@sundaymirror.co.uk\par \par \uc2 Document SMIRR00020140223ea2n000b3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

"Because in England they have opened the gate. They can't do nothing to you. Romania is in Europe now.\par \par \uc2 "The girls, they have 20 clients per day, no problem. Romanian girls are good for this because it is the job that they know. They stay in school and then they can't find work and the only solution is to go to work in other countries.\par \par \uc2 "If you are OK with them and don't beat them they will be good. They work and they know what they do."\par \par \uc2 By the end of the night Meder would offer our men four girls, just out of their teens, for \u163\'00\'A32,000.\par \par \uc2 He said the girls would charge punters \u163\'00\'A3120 an hour but they wouldn't know their pimp would keep \u163\'00\'A370 of that.\par \par \uc2 The deal was offered only three weeks after we first made contact with a London-based fixer.\par \par \uc2 Meder told us he would be driving to Britain this week on business. Yesterday we informed Scotland Yard of our investigation and told them Meder was heading here.\par \par \uc2 DISAPPEAR\par \par \uc2 The giggling, starry-eyed girls know a life of prostitution awaits but can have little idea of the brutal reality that may entail.\par \par \uc2 Once in the UK, the girls disappear into a black market of sleazy backstreet saunas, brothels and relentless escort agency work. Many turn to drugs in despair.\par \par \uc2 The girls are briefed on how to dupe \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  officials into believing they are entering the country to earn a living as hotel workers, waitresses or cleaners.\par \par \uc2 Last night a shocked Labour MP Fiona MacTaggart, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Human Trafficking, said of our evidence: "This is clearly horrible exploitation.\par \par \uc2 "We aren't doing enough to protect young women from around Europe from being sold into sexual bondage like this. It is outrageous."\par \par \uc2 On Thursday our investigators joined Meder in the Liquid club in the back-streets of Sibiu in Romania's poverty-stricken Transylvania.\par \par \uc2 After introducing us to one of his muscular henchmen, Meder led us to a VIP area above the dance floor. He ordered bottles of vodka for his table and told the girls to parade for our benefit. He constantly plied the girls with spirits as he auctioned them off.\par \par \uc2 Introducing a tiny 22-year-old, wearing only a black boob tube and leather trousers, Meder told us she speaks only "a tiny bit of English" but is extremely keen to go to Britain.\par \par \uc2 Asked if she knew what kind of work she would be expected to do, he grinned and said: "Of course."\par \par \uc2 A 23-year-old was then shown to the table. We were told she was due to sit an important exam the following week. But Meder said: "No problem. I can speak with people and they will give her pass. She can travel to London next week."\par \par \uc2 The fixer was at pains to emphasise there would be no trouble importing his girls and making money from them. He said: "This kind of work is between the rules. It's not legal and it is not illegal."\par \par \uc2 Like many gang bosses throughout Eastern Europe Meder knows the EU policy of "free movement" between member states works well for them.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  restrictions placed on Bulgaria and Romania when they joined the EU in 2007 ran out on New Year's Day, allowing their citizens easy entry to the UK. Watchdogs estimate European crime lords already net \u163\'00\'A320billion a year from the vice trade. And experts fear that number will continue to soar because of the end of restrictions.\par \par \uc2 The open borders policy means the movement of sex workers now goes largely undetected by \uc2 Interpol\uc2  and the \uc2 UK Border Agency\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 National Crime Agency figures show there were 1,746 reports of human trafficking from 112 countries last year - a 47 per cent leap on the 2012 total.\par \par \uc2 And in 2010, the \uc2 Association of Chief Police Officers\uc2  estimated that up to 12,200 women working in off-street prostitution in Britain had possibly been trafficked. It is little wonder a confident Meder told our investigators: "There will be no problem. If somebody ask (at \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ) 'what do you do here?' Then the girl say 'I work in a hotel' or 'I have a friend.' They have one thousand possible lies. Don't worry about it.\par \par \uc2 "The Romanian girls are not stupid. They go with identity card now."\par \par \uc2 Meder also introduced our team to the girls in the picture - one 21, the other 22 - who asked to be taken to England as a pair for safety.\par \par \uc2 BRAGGED\par \par \uc2 At one point, Meder pushed the 22-year-old towards our team, desperate to make a sale. She said: "I look forward to seeing you in London next week."\par \par \uc2 In a vain attempt to justify his sex slaves operation, Meder assured us: "They go because they want to go. I do not have to tell them. They are not forced. It is no longer working like that. They go because they want to go." At a meeting in a restaurant on the outskirts of Sibiu a day earlier, he bragged about the riches that could be made from his stable of women.\par \par \uc2 "One friend of mine in one year with three girls, he make one million euros," said Meder. "When I meet him in Austria he come with a Maserati. A 350,000 euro car. With just three girls in one year."\par \par \uc2 He claimed the key to a fortune was shepherding the girls around countries. "If you want to make good money you have to change them," said Meder.\par \par \uc2 "I have girls two weeks in England and after that I go three weeks with them in Norway and then after that Swiss and after that Ireland. That's how you make good money. Outside the club on Thursday night, Meder rubbed his hands at the thought of another sale. He told our investigators: "You tell me when you want the girl to come. You book the flight and they will be in London on Wednesday." Our team made their excuses and left.\par \par \uc2 Last night Tory MP Peter Bone, who previously chaired the all-party group on trafficking, said the end of restrictions was "a gift to traffickers". He said: "That's one of the disadvantages of free movement."\par \par \uc2 Aneeta Prem, of Freedom Charity, feared the numbers were "just the tip of the iceberg".\par \par \uc2 She added: "This is modern day slavery. The number of people contacting us who have been sexually trafficked seems to be growing enormously. It becomes a nightmare for them. They feel powerless to go back home."\par \par \uc2 matthew.drake@trinitymirror.com\par \par \uc2 COMMENT: PAGE 14\par \par \uc2 When I meet him in Austria friend come with a Maserati.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A $19 bn swoop on What'sApp shows how \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2  are using their financial might to carve up the digital world. Simon Duke reports\par \par \uc2 The riches of Silicon Valley were only eight miles away, but may as well have been on another planet. For the 16-year-old \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , the lavish enclave of the technology industry must have seemed a cruel taunt as he queued for food stamps.\par \par \uc2 Jan Koum\uc2  had fled Ukraine in 1992 to escape the anti-Semitism and poverty unleashed when the Soviet Union collapsed. He and his mother had made a game start to their new life. With help from the US welfare system, they had rented a poky flat in Mountain View \u8212\'20\'14 a short drive from moneyed Palo Alto.\par \par \uc2 She worked as a babysitter while Koum scrubbed the floors of a local store after school to earn a few extra dollars. That was never enough, though, so he would join the food line.\par \par \uc2 Twenty-two years later, Koum returned to the former North County Social Services office to complete his improbable rise into the ranks of the super-rich. Last week, outside the drab one-storey building, he signed the contract to sell his five-year-old messaging service, called WhatsApp, to \uc2 Facebook\uc2  for $19bn (\u8364\'20\'AC13.8bn). With an estimated 45% stake, Koum \u8212\'20\'14 38 tomorrow \u8212\'20\'14 is sitting on $8.6bn. \uc2 Brian Acton\uc2 , his co-founder, has a reported 15% stake, worth $2.9bn.\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 Facebook\uc2  founder \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 , the swoop on WhatsApp was a signal of intent as the kingpins of Silicon Valley take part in a landgrab. As smartphones and tablet computers upend the tech industry, the law of the jungle applies: eat or be eaten.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Google\uc2  and other rivals are using their cash piles and inflated share prices to pounce on start-ups. Since the start of the year, tech firms worth a total of $42.5bn have changed hands in America \u8212\'20\'14 the highest level since the dotcom boom, according to data from Thomson Reuters.\par \par \uc2 The normal rules for valuing companies have been ditched as the hunger for the Next Big Thing has taken hold.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's $1bn acquisition of Instagram in 2012 now looks like child's play, with WhatsApp setting a new standard in the crazy economics of the Valley. The smartphone app allows users to send messages and photos to each other free of charge. A clever concept, but last year it generated just $20m in revenues from its 450m users. In truth, Zuckerberg had no choice but to write the fifth biggest cheque in the history of the tech industry. The \uc2 Facebook\uc2  founder could not afford to allow WhatsApp, which is expected to have 1bn users next year, to become a threat to his own business. A more terrifying scenario would have seen WhatsApp fall into the hands of \uc2 Google\uc2 , which tabled a $10bn bid for the company.\par \par \uc2 REJECTION came as a bitter blow. In 2009, \uc2 Brian Acton\uc2 , a thirtysomething software engineer, applied to one of the hottest start-ups in the San Francisco Bay Area. After a decade of slog at \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 a net pioneer turned dinosaur \u8212\'20\'14 the Stanford graduate just didn't fit the bill. "\uc2 Facebook\uc2  turned me down. It was a great opportunity to connect with some fantastic people," tweeted Acton. \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , too, rejected his application.\par \par \uc2 At a loose end, Acton joined forces with Koum, his friend and former \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  colleague.\par \par \uc2 The Ukranian founded WhatsApp in February 2009. His first plan was to allow users to show status updates to friends on their smartphones, but this swiftly morphed into its messaging service.\par \par \uc2 At the time, its chief rival was Blackberry's BBM, but that worked only for owners of the clunky handsets. WhatsApp's unique twist was to allow users to communicate via any smartphone at no charge. It was not long before hundreds of thousands of people had downloaded WhatsApp, and Koum and Acton found they could charge for the app. Now customers use WhatsApp free for the first year then pay $1 a year.\par \par \uc2 WhatsApp is not the only wildly popular messaging tool. Snapchat, which allows users to send pictures or videos that vanish in seconds, turned down bids of $3bn and $4bn from \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2  last year.\par \par \uc2 Messaging companies are prized because they are rapidly becoming the social network of choice for the young. Many teenagers consider \uc2 Facebook\uc2  pass\u233\'00\'E9 and recoil at the thought of using the same service as their parents.\par \par \uc2 Deeper forces are at play, however, which spurred Zuckerberg into action. In the era when the PC was gateway to the web, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  could keep its 1bn users corralled within its own gated community sending messages to friends, sharing photos and playing games. By contrast, smartphones and tablets are more like the Wild West, with other apps just two taps away. If \uc2 Facebook\uc2  cannot develop its own exciting new services, it has no choice but to pounce. The alternative is a costly slide into irrelevance.\par \par \uc2 The WhatsApp acquisition underlined the "continued determination of \uc2 Facebook\uc2  to be the 'next' \uc2 Facebook\uc2 ", said Benedict Evans of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. "The winnertakes-all dynamics of social on the desktop web do not appear to apply on mobile."\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  is paying $4bn cash, $12bn in shares plus bonus stock worth a further $3bn to gain control of WhatsApp. The price is by any measure astronomical, but \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's share price held steady after the deal. Investors know \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has to move quickly to adapt as smartphones take over.\par \par \uc2 Zuckerberg has also built up a large stock of goodwill since the company's botched float in 2012. Back then, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  had no mobile revenues. Now, however, more than half its turnover is from ads served on phones and tablets.\par \par \uc2 Buying WhatsApp is a powerful defence of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's empire. However, it also extends its reach into more countries. If WhatsApp's user base doubles as expected, and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  can extract a little more from them, the investment could pay handsomely. While \uc2 Facebook\uc2  seeks to buttress its dominant position, \uc2 Google\uc2  has loftier ambitions. Over the past year, the search giant has spent billions of dollars on start-ups in niche fields from robotics to smart energy meters. Last month, it gobbled up a two-year-old UK start-up that teaches computers how to think like humans. The $400m takeover of Deep Mind, founded by chess prodigy and neuroscience boffin Demis Hassabis, will bolster \uc2 Google\uc2 's drive to create tools that predict the needs of users.\par \par \uc2 The London company is shrouded in secrecy. However, one of its early projects enables computers to play arcade games, learn the rules and devise a winning strategy \u8212\'20\'14 without human assistance.\par \par \uc2 The takeover came just weeks after \uc2 Google\uc2  spent $3.2bn on \uc2 Nest Labs\uc2 , a developer of wi-fi devices for the home, such as programmable thermostats that learn from their owner's behaviour. Like Amazon, it is also expanding into robotics. Two months ago it snaffled \uc2 Boston Dynamics\uc2 , which develops intelligent machines for the \uc2 US army\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Among its creations are BigDog, a four-legged robot that can navigate bumpy terrain, and Cheetah, which boasts a top-speed of 28mph.\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 Google\uc2 , intelligent machines will be critical in the company's quest for a deeper understanding of human behaviour, which will in turn supercharge its online advertising cash machine.\par \par \uc2 THE land grab shows no sign of abating. The riches that the WhatsApp founders have generated in just five years will embolden the next Valley entrepreneurs. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2  are riding high and boast colossal resources to swoop on any rival. With a market value of $405bn and a cash mountain of more than $50bn, the search giant can easily accelerate its acquisition drive. Zuckerberg, meanwhile, pulls all the strings at a company worth nearly $180bn. Buying WhatsApp meant giving away just over 10% of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . That's justifiable if it provides long-term protection. There is a limit, however, to how many times he can devour putative competitors before destroying the value of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Tasty British morsels\par \par \uc2 The American giants that dominate the technology industry are increasingly turning to Britain''s vibrant start-up scene to buttress their empires.\par \par \uc2 Zynga\uc2 , the San Francisco-based games developer, paid $527m (\u8364\'20\'AC380m) last month for Oxford tech firm NaturalMotion \u8212\'20\'14 founded by a former zoology PhD student.\par \par \uc2 Already this year, \uc2 Google\uc2  has taken two bites into the British technology scene.\par \par \uc2 In January it swooped on DeepMind, a two-year-old artificial intelligence developer, and last week it grabbed advertising technology developer Spider.io for an undisclosed sum.\par \par \uc2 Spider develops software that identifies and blocks online fraud. Fake clicks generated by computers have become a big problem in the $120bn advertising sector. As the biggest player, \uc2 Google\uc2  wants to clean up the industry and prove to advertisers that their ads reach real people. Spider's fraud-busting software can help "weed out bad actors" who create fake traffic, said \uc2 Google\uc2 . The British company has exposed several high-profile scams, including a fraudster who hacked into PCs to create fake advertising views.\par \par \uc2 The next takeover could be Hailo, the fast-growing on-demand taxi app. Founded in London in 2011, Hailo has expanded into a dozen cities, including New York, Washington and Chicago. Earlier this month it hired the former finance chief of \uc2 Ubiquisys\uc2 , a British tech company sold to America's Cisco for $310m last year.\par \par \uc2 Hailo has dreams of world domination and aims to be in 50 cities in a dozen countries by the end of next year. Experts believe it could make a tasty morsel for \uc2 Google\uc2  because of the amounts of location-based data it could collect from its users.\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140223ea2n00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 JUDGE FOR YOURSELF\b0\par\par\uc2 Simon Cowell   \par \uc2 2,138 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 1; Eire\par 4,5,6,7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Harry Hill's musical is merciless in its portrayal of The X Factor \u8212\'20\'14 so why has \uc2 Simon Cowell\uc2  given it his blessing?\par \par \uc2 What can you say about \uc2 Simon Cowell\uc2  that hasn't been said a thousand times before? That he's camp, bitchy, rich, rude, smokes wherever he likes, has a highly inflated opinion of himself, went out with the singer Sinitta, put Power Rangers and Teletubbies into the charts, and has very, very high-waisted trousers. All of which everyone knows, and all of which is in Fabulous, the opening number of I Can't Sing! The X Factor Musical, penned by Harry Hill and partly financed... by Cowell himself. Self-mockery? As they say on the \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , WTF?\par \par \uc2 Pop-culture musicals fall into two camps: the Mamma Mia!/We Will Rock You one of crowbarring the hits into a dubious tale; or the Book of Mormon/ Jerry Springer: The Opera one of merciless lampooning. I Can't Sing! is firmly in the latter camp. It's loosely based on the tumbling four months of chaos surrounding The X Factor's 2010 series, which featured Cheryl Cole suffering malaria; contestants battling visa issues and mental-health problems, and claiming incapacity benefit; ludicrous performances from a Brazilian karate teacher; and viewer uproar over...well, everything. To live through those heady days was almost like living in France.\par \par \uc2 Nigel Harman, the EastEnders-to-Downton bad boy, plays Simon (with Victoria Elliott and Ashley Knight filling the other judges' chairs) \u8212\'20\'14 although he's unwilling when I ask him to give us a bit of Cowell. "I'm not Jon Culshaw," he insists. "There are classic mannerisms I use, like the way he stands and his hand gestures, but we take it into a whole new realm of farce." Did Cowell give him any tips? "He said, 'Just go out there and be a dick every night.'"\par \par \uc2 For the curious, \uc2 YouTube\uc2  footage of Harman's National Television Awards performance of Fabulous demonstrates his point \u8212\'20\'14 he winks and glitters and flaps his hands in a spectacular wave of such arch musical campery, it makes Stephen Sondheim look like Dr Dre.\par \par \uc2 "We had lots of people trying to do really serious versions of the show, but we turned them down," Cowell explains when he joins us, perched in a shiny conference suite deep in the belly of a huge central London hotel. (It takes so long to walk from reception to the meeting room that it feels as if we're in The Shining.) "When Harry used to take the piss out of us on TV Burp, we all wanted to be the one he parodied. He knew we had banned the word 'journey' \u8212\'20\'14 they're not on a journey, they're on a talent show for a couple of weeks, so we fined anyone who used the word 'journey'. Then we banned the word 'dream' because it was getting out of control. Of course, when he pitched to me, the first song they played was called Journey to a Dream. It made me laugh, and I was in."\par \par \uc2 As we chat, he leans back in his chair, wearing a tight V-necked grey T-shirt over a tan, puffing on an e-cigarette and nibbling from the plates of canap\u233\'00\'E9s the hotel staff keep placing on the large conference table. He looks surprisingly relaxed for a man just days away from the arrival of his first child, Eric\u8212\'20\'14 born in New York four days after we meet \u8212\'20\'14 and talking to me only three days after the US version of The X Factor was cancelled. Despite the furore surrounding Eric's conception \u8212\'20\'14 his mother, Lauren Silverman, was still married to an American property magnate, Andrew Silverman, at the time \u8212\'20\'14 Cowell says he's "feeling really good about it, yeah. Now it's all nearly happened, I'm excited. I mean, it's actually real. It's a first time for me, so I didn't know how I was going to feel, but I'm excited."\par \par \uc2 Is he going to put his son on the stage? "I'll give it a year," he grins wickedly. "I don't want to exploit him too early."\par \par \uc2 The US X Factor issue he waves away almost casually. "I cut a deal to come back and judge the UK show last year, and knew the American one would come off the air \u8212\'20\'14 they said if I wasn't on it, they wouldn't renew it." He shrugs. "I was hoping I could change their minds, but in the end it's worth resting it for a year. We did that in Australia \u8212\'20\'14 took it off air, changed network, put it back on and it went to No 1." He gives a small smile. "There are eight music competition shows on this year in America, and you don't want to be fighting against that."\par \par \uc2 Last summer, however, when Forbes magazine named Cowell America's richest TV celebrity \u8212\'20\'14 he earned $95m (\u163\'00\'A357m) between June 2012 and June 2013, ahead of \uc2 Oprah Winfrey\uc2 's $77m \u8212\'20\'14 US X Factor profits were credited with boosting the profits of his company, Simco. He shakes his head. "The most important thing I wanted was to get the UK show back to where we were when I left in 2010," he says emphatically. "As much as the show is important for us as a company and my partnership with \uc2 Sony\uc2 , what comes out the back of it is really all they care about.\par \par \uc2 "In 2010 we had Cher Lloyd, One Direction, Rebecca Ferguson. That's 45m albums. The big stars come from the UK shows."\par \par \uc2 Certainly, One Direction's American business dwarfs The X Factor USA. Both the boyband's debut album, Up All Night, and its follow-up, Take Me Home, moved more than 2m copies Stateside on Cowell's label, Syco, and made them the first British band to enter the US charts at No 1 with their first two albums. According to the event tickets trend analyst TiqIQ, the band will have raked in $500m in ticket sales by the end of 2014, which, added to $300m in record sales, a $150m box-office take for their movie, This Is Us, DVD sales of $15m and merchandise sales of $70m, makes them the first billion-dollar boyband.\par \par \uc2 With The X Factor UK's ratings trailing at less than 10m \u8212\'20\'14 way down from its 2010 peak, when an astonishing 19.4m people watched the final \u8212\'20\'14 you can see Cowell's point. If another Harry Styles-shaped egg is to slip from the show's golden cloaca, it requires his undivided attention. ITV is paying him \u163\'00\'A3150m for the next three seasons of X Factor \u8212\'20\'14 if he finds another One Direction, that sort of change is almost irrelevant.\par \par \uc2 Is that why he gave the go-ahead for the musical? It can't be for the money. Is I Can't Sing! part of a cunning awareness strategy for the relaunch of The X Factor UK? To be fair, Harry Hill, his co-writer, \uc2 Steve Brown\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 whose CV includes Alan Partridge and TV Burp \u8212\'20\'14 and the director, Sean Foley, whose Jeeves and Wooster play is a current West End hit, are definitely no Syco stooges. Harman's route to the role was equally organic. "They did this work-inprogress show ages ago, which I avoided, thinking, 'It's going to be terrible,'" he recalls. "But friends of mine went and loved it. They said, 'It's not what you're expecting. One of them, Amanda, said, 'I think you should play Simon.' When the script came round, I could see what she meant."\par \par \uc2 Cowell insists he was doubtful at first, but has "embraced the madness. I think people will be surprised that we backed it, because it is a bit close to the mark at times, but that's what makes it fun." He picks at a canap\u233\'00\'E9. "I mean, I don't do research groups on anything. I just think, would I like it? I'm not a fan of musicals \u8212\'20\'14 usually I'm out after the first song \u8212\'20\'14 but this one I liked." He insists, and Harman concurs, that he's had no say in any part of the script. "The deal I made with Harry was, I'm not going to change a word. It is what it is. If it looks like I had an influence, it won't work."\par \par \uc2 Which ought to seem unlikely, but I have personal experience of Cowell's willingness to encourage the kind of coverage others forbid. A few years back, I interviewed him for this paper in his large, immaculate Holland Park not-quite-amansion. He was charming, restless and slightly edgy, smoking throughout the interview, explaining how he'd lived in the Mandarin Oriental for 18 months until he ved w t ity got fed up with room service, how he saved every nasty email he'd received, how he hated being patronised and how he got so mad that Popstars \u8212\'20\'14 the first music reality show \u8212\'20\'14 nicked a song from one of his bands' albums that he started making TV to take Popstars off the air.\par \par \uc2 Views, 8m, labowell Given his reluctance to grant interviews, I traded on this chat for a couple of years \u8212\'20\'14 editors were keen for a splash of insight as The X Factor's ratings soared to 17m, 18m, 19m. For one piece, I had to call his collaborators, including Louis Walsh, as well as more disgruntled ex-colleagues such as Jedward and the American Idol producer Nigel Lythgoe, to canvass their opinions. His ucer pals checked in with Simon \u8212\'20\'14 he'd read the original less than flattering piece \u8212\'20\'14 but he gave the go-ahead and they delivered snarky, unpolished comments. When this interview came around, I expected to be blacklisted, but he welcomed me with a handshake, a big grin and "You're looking well, it's been ages".\par \par \uc2 Harman is still slightly incredulous that Cowell is OK with everything. "People will sit in the audience and go, 'I can't believe he's allowed this to happen,'" he says. "The main girl contestant's back story is that she lives in a caravan under a motorway flyover, with her grandfather, who is in an iron lung, and they're so poor that if she wants to make toast, she has to unplug the iron lung." He bursts out laughing. "And she goes up on the motorway to get roadkill so she can feed her grandfather. And all the other contestants are resentful that their stories aren't as heartwarming.\par \par \uc2 "There's a hunchback rapping like Eminem, Cheryl's just called Jordy... I mean, it's outrageous."\par \par \uc2 "Cheryl is going to kill me when she sees it," Cowell mutters darkly at that point. "I mean, seriously, I'm going to get it in the neck." Then he shrugs like a true Tin Pan impresario, far more at home in the dusty backstreets of the West End than on the distant lawns of Beverly Hills.\par \par \uc2 "But then, it's the stuff over which you have no control that always works best." c I Can't Sing! The X Factor Musical previews at the London Palladium, W1, from Thursday Stranger than fiction I Can't Sing! takes inspiration from The X Factor's 2010 series \u8212\'20\'14 which gave ITV its highest non-football audience for at least a decade, launched One Direction and popularised the phrase "\uc2 Twitter\uc2  bomb": a TV moment so jawdropping that social media ripples translate rapidly into front-page news. Kicking off with contestant Shirlena Johnson leaving the show over mental-health issues after her chaotic but successful audition, the show's real-life shocks will prove hard to top.\par \par \uc2 Cheryl Cole Has Malaria Shock The Geordie judge failed to make some of the audition rounds as she was "close to death" after contracting the illness on holiday.\par \par \uc2 Cher Lloyd Racism Shock Online hate mail over her gypsy background proved less damaging to her X Factor run than her duet with will.i.am, which sounded like two musicians falling downstairs in four different keys at once.\par \par \uc2 Gamu Nhengu \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Row Shock Gamu was a viewer favourite, and Cole sparked outrage by not taking her through to the live shows. ITV denied reports that this was because Gamu had visa issues.\par \par \uc2 Everything Wagner Did Shock The Brazilian-born karate instructor Wagner Fiuza-Carrilho produced shambolic performances, forgot his words and sang out of tune. At least 150 \uc2 Facebook\uc2  pages, some with 20,000 members, were set up to co-ordinate pro-Wagner voting campaigns.\par \par \uc2 There's a hunchback rapping, Cheryl's called Jordy... it's outrageous\par \par \uc2 People in the audience will go, 'I can't believe he's allowed this to happen'\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140223ea2n0003s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

Instead of sharing spaghetti and intimacy with a restaurant full of other couples, people were forced to stay at home cultivating macular degeneration because Netflix chose February 14 to release the entire second series of House of Cards. This is, supposedly, the new viewing model. Kevin Spacey likes to reassure the codgers that there's really nothing new about it at all. It's just like reading a novel, he says. You wouldn't wait for the next chapter of The Da Vinci Code, would you? Don't answer that.\par \par \uc2 Was it worth the not-waiting, though? Not quite. The first series \u8212\'20\'14 or season, as we have to call it, although it isn't \u8212\'20\'14 was slick, poetic and unremittingly cold. Where The Thick of It's Westminster is a house of fools, House of Cards showed Washington DC as a nest of vipers made crueller by its veneer of charm and decorum. If you watched it on an iPad, it was unputdownable, new television's equivalent of a page-turner. But season two was more of the same, and because we have now become accustomed to the Machiavellian depravity of the central characters, it felt like a step back.\par \par \uc2 As with any habit, you need to increase the dosage to stay hooked, so the scale of the depravity increased. Spacey's Underwood, now vice president, killed somebody in the first episode. This wasn't his first opportunistic murder, but it was the first that was Bobby-in-the-shower ridiculous. Robin Wright's Claire Underwood, a study of ruthless emotional detachment in season one, became less emotionally detached and therefore less subtle. Both remained mesmerising, but the plot got sillier.\par \par \uc2 You may not have ruined your Valentine's Day, so I'll keep this review relatively spoiler-free. The guinea-pig-stroking superhacker and the Chinese billionaire sadomasochist were a great shame. And by the 19th time Francis "FU" Underwood had done the opposite of what he said he'd do, surely someone else might have noticed before it was, once again, too late? I watched it to the end, wishing seasons were shorter, bladders were bigger, needing to know how it would conclude. Of course, a third season has already been commissioned, so we know how this one concludes. You can't lose Frank Underwood. His rise will continue, and we will continue to wait, perhaps indefinitely, for his fall. Which is a shame. As he himself might say, you need to kill the golden goose before it stops laying eggs.\par \par \uc2 There was better television on the actual television. We might even have another programme to add to the golden-age-of-American-television list. HBO's True Detective, starring a newly thin Matthew McConaughey and a newly not-thin Woody Harrelson as former detectives involved in a two-decades-old murder case, managed to be unlike any cop show before it. Who would have thought there was still more to this genre, now the Scandinavians have bagsied jumpers and Asperger's syndrome? McConaughey, the former himbo now universally feted as someone who can suddenly act (see Oscars), plays an off-the-rails boozer and philosopher (nothing new there).\par \par \uc2 Harrelson does the midlife-crisis family man with a paunch (ditto). The murder is set in Louisiana and has occult overtones, and the victim is a prostitute (ditto, ditto, ditto). The novelty comes with the narrative structure: two former detectives giving separate accounts of a murder investigation long since solved to two current detectives reinvestigating it. It soon becomes clear that neither narrator is reliable. Time and self-interest obscure the facts, and the viewer, for once, is confronted with something far more taxing than a typical whodunit.\par \par \uc2 And because our two Hollywood A-listers turn in such consummately, convincingly relaxed performances, the pressure to get to the end, to turn the page, to find out who-dun-it, is gone. The drama exists in every scene, intensified by the Louisiana landscape and the surreal script. Plot is by the by.\par \par \uc2 As anyone who has accidentally watched The Musketeers will tell you, we're not having a golden age of television on this side of the Atlantic, but the second series of Line of Duty is rather good. Police investigating other police for corruption and cover-ups is apposite, but you can't have six hours of drama based on whether or not someone called someone else a pleb. Nobody would believe it. So this series is about whether a policewoman was involved in the murders of a protected witness and three other police officers.\par \par \uc2 British crime dramas are at a disadvantage because we're simply not as violent as our American cousins. Either you do red tape, procedural issues and speeding tickets, which might be dull, or you do guns, kidnapping and explosions, which might seem gratuitously sensational. This did a bit of both, which was, well, different. First off, two officers were killed executionstyle and the witness was set on fire... only to survive... only to be nobbled by a man dressed as a female nurse sneaking into intensive care (clich\u233\'00\'E9 klaxon). Then a detective gets thrown from a fifth-storey window. Then there are lots of interviews and people saying "for the benefit of the tape". So it's a very British take on guns and explosions.\par \par \uc2 Holding it all together is Keeley Hawes, playing the apparently harmless, victimised officer who may or may not be the villain of the piece. Two episodes in, it could go either way, but my bet is she's the Keyser S\u246\'00\'F6ze of the show. If only it was on Netflix, I could have found out by now.\par \par \uc2 If they could only write faster, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith could have a golden age all to themselves. After Psychoville, they have knocked out Inside No 9, a series of short stories each set in a different No 9 and steeped in their trademark dark humour. The third No 9 is a flat occupied by Shearsmith's Tom, a primary-school teacher, and Gerri, an actress played by the actress Gemma Arterton. Once you've got over the idea that someone as tall as Gerri would go out with someone as short as Tom, it's all perfectly plausible.\par \par \uc2 A tramp returns a wallet to Tom, Tom lets the tramp come in for a drink and the tramp takes over his life.\par \par \uc2 Gerri moves out. Tom becomes a tramp. The tramp becomes Tom. Like the best of Roald Dahl, we've been led, incrementally, plausibly, from a normal state of affairs to the unbelievably bizarre. I won't tell you how it ends because it's still on iPlayer. Binge away.\par \par \uc2 Channel 4 is taking on Pointless, the defending champion of daytime television, with Superstar Dogs, in which "superstar dogs" negotiate obstacle courses and fetch balls from swimming pools. The genius of the format, as far as I can tell from the first programme, is that they haven't used proper dogs. These are mutts, the kind that are allowed to sleep on the bed and might cock a leg, rather than fetch a ball. Their enthusiasm is not in doubt, but their ability is highly questionable. The result is television more gripping than any of the fancy dramas above. Will the labradoodle refuse to jump in the pool for a second time? Will the spaniel that did jump make it back before its ears drag it under? And how long will it be before one of them mauls John Barrowman? As for The Big British \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Row, why would anyone migrate to a country where Katie Hopkins's views are televised? If you really want to stop people coming in, stick her on the border and ask her to smile. c AA Gill is away THE CRITICS\par \par \uc2 The drama exists in every scene of HBO's latest, True Detective\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140223ea2n00058\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

Not farmers' vacuum-packed, happy piggy, Cotswold camembert, grazing markets, free-range sourdough, but...\par \par \uc2 Dirty British costers with a salt-coarse backchat Shouting from the barrahs in the mad market days With a cargo of sweat pants Moody flicks, dog food Gucci bags, face packs, and cheap tin trays.\par \par \uc2 If streets are the arteries and veins of a city, then street markets are its lymph system. They remain stubbornly impervious to the changes, resist gentrification and politeness. Ilike North End Road in Fulham because it flicks Vs at the property prices that surround it; even Portobello Road manages to retain at least some of its original \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , Rachmanesque insouciance, despite the tourists, and Berwick Street shrugs off the mediocrity and homogenous poshburger culture that's infected Soho like an enlarged prostate.\par \par \uc2 Berwick Street is still mistress of the nebulous and the profane, the costers still bellow their incomprehensible vegetative wares, the toms still inhabit the upstairs copulatoriums and the small shops that line the road offer yards and yards of twill and bombazine, chintz and slub silk, crepe de Chine for the opera, cerise elasticated nylon for the tranny, leopard print for the lap dancer, watered satin for the bride's mother. This is the warp and weft of old Soho and I used to work in the arts supply shop Cowling & Wilcox, on Broadwick Street, which runs off Berwick Street. A couple of weeks ago I was walking through the market and thinking about them, when I bumped into Patrick Kinmonth.\par \par \uc2 He said: "I was just thinking about you Drainy." He always calls me Drainy. "You worked in that shop, the art one." Patrick is one of my oldest friends and we have remained very fond and very close by the happy expedient of rarely seeing each other, never letting the parochial sweaty reality spoil the pristine nostalgia of absent comradeship.\par \par \uc2 Not that we could meet much if we wanted to: he is booked up decades in advance now, being one of the world's great designers of opera and ballet. When I first knew him, he was a young fashion editor on Vogue and would stop off at the shop on his way to Hanover Square, stand on the shop floor and regard me in my fetching blue pinny, surrounded by Pantone and felt tips, and wave a lilac kidgloved hand in a Wildesque gesture of dashing decadence, and say: "Darling, darling, this is all so real, so you don't change a thing."\par \par \uc2 I said: "Come and have some lunch, I'm reviewing that restaurant across the road." We sat in the window and beamed. "What have you been doing?" he asked. "I've just been to Stockholm," I swanked. "Handing out the AA Gill Restaurant Award for the Dagens Nyheter."\par \par \uc2 "Oh, how funny," he said. "I've just been in Stockholm designing a ballet." (Never heard of it.) "Funny," I said "My awards thing was in the opera house."\par \par \uc2 "No!" he said "I was in the opera house. I must have been walking out just as you were walking in. Where did you go after?" "Rolfs K\u246\'00\'F6k, for a bite." "Oh, my God," he said, "Rolfs K\u246\'00\'F6k is my favourite."\par \par \uc2 "I know. What a find. Rolfs K\u246\'00\'F6k, I couldn't love it more. I could eat Rolfs K\u246\'00\'F6k seven days a week."\par \par \uc2 At this point my original dining companion, Laura Weir, from Style, the one in the fetching frock every week, arrived and I made introductions and added: "Rolfs K\u246\'00\'F6k is a restaurant."\par \par \uc2 "Oh," she said airily. "You don't have to explain."\par \par \uc2 "No, no, in Stockholm, really, it's a wonderful restaurant. If you saw it written down it doesn't sound quite so\u8230\'20\'26" "It doesn't matter, boys. I don't mind where you eat. I'm not one to judge."\par \par \uc2 Well, I am, which isn't altogether good news for Ember Yard. This is a new tapas restaurant. I really thought the fandango of tapas was over, but I suppose there is always room for another little plate to share. Actually, Fandango would be a good name for a tapas restaurant: an energetic Spanish dance accompanied by castanets and also a stupid waste of time. At home in Spain, tapas is food that's served in bars to eat while you stand up and drink without castanets.\par \par \uc2 It's not a sit-down lunch or dinner and it's not as satisfying when it is: the multiplesharing deal means plates of food keep interrupting the conversation with their dour practical demands, the tables are never big enough, sharing is always cack-handed and involves "excuse me's" and reaching and passing and getting your fingers sticky like a 14-year-old at a school dance.\par \par \uc2 Food really isn't the point of lunch; it's conversation. The menu isn't long but the dishes are complicated. The selling point here is the charcoal grill. Ember Yard's menu goes straight to Pseuds Corner for this gem: "Single species charcoal and wood is used for all char-grilling and roasting. Currently we're using hazel and silver birch." Stipulating a singlespecies fire is, even by Soho standards, risibly outr\u233\'00\'E9.\par \par \uc2 The dining room is that familiar mix of the artfully unfinished and intrusively industrial. Dishes come on a lot of planks and slate. I really thought that slate had become such a dinner clich\u233\'00\'E9 that it was only used to carry the corpse of a tapas out. Anyway, we tried most of it and you could eat here and think it was a perfectly good Iberian-style diner, or you could think it was all a fandango with added castanets.\par \par \uc2 The quality of the plates is variable: jamon was, as ever, good but badly sliced and the pleasure of jamon is all in the knifework. First, with the meaty stuff: chargrilled Iberico pork ribs, hand-ground chicken and, this being Soho, there was a burger, actually not at all bad, made from smoked beef with chorizo ketchup, whatever that is.\par \par \uc2 The best fish was smoked cod with bean, samphire and clams; not so great was the mackerel with mussels and purslane, or the steamed octopus and the beetroot with blood orange.\par \par \uc2 The service was jolly and cocky, in a "I'm only doing this while my agent sorts out my record deal/film script" sort of way. But it was the nicest lunch I've had this year, because of the company and the chat, and that's the bottom line of all lunch.\par \par \uc2 Rolfs K\u246\'00\'F6k, by the way, is a real restaurant. I didn't make it up for the sake of a pathetically smutty doubleentendre and, if you ever find yourself in Stockholm, I recommend it.

The leaves are slightly sweet and a little bitter, with a crisp crunch. There are about a dozen main types of radicchio grown in northern Italy; all are late-season winter vegetables. Common radicchios include chioggia, which looks like a small maroon cabbage with thick white veins reaching up from the base; treviso, with narrower, longer leaves; the curly radicchio trevisano tardivo and small shiny grumolo rosso.\par \par \uc2 BUY\par \par \uc2 Pink radicchio can vary from pastel pink with light-green shades to magenta, but the colour doesn't affect the flavour. Pick ones with crisp leaves and no brown edges. They should hold their shape when shaken and the white central part should feel firm when pressed. Radicchio is available from late October until early March, and will keep in the fridge for a couple of days. Price: \u163\'00\'A33.50 per 150g.\par \par \uc2 PREPARE\par \par \uc2 Pink radicchio is tender enough not to need cooking. Wash the vegetable, shake off any excess water and pull the leaves from the head. Discard the white central part as it can be spongy and bitter.\par \par \uc2 EAT\par \par \uc2 Radicchio is known for its bitterness. This variety is sweeter than other radicchios, but holds a bitter note, too. It is best eaten fresh in a salad, or with a citrus vinaigrette (try orange or pink grapefruit). It also works well with orange segments, thin shavings of fennel, apple slices, pear, blue cheese or almonds. The key is to balance out the light, bitter flavour with sweetness. Other radicchios can also be used in salads, saut\u233\'00\'E9ed, grilled or mixed into pasta or risotto, deep fried and dipped into bagna cauda (a hot, anchovy-based dip, from Piedmont), or eaten with extravirgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.\par \par \uc2 MORE\par \par \uc2 Radicchio is an Italian variety of chicory. Modern cultivation of it began in the 15th century in northern Italy. Pliny the Elder first wrote about its medical properties as a blood purifier and to ease insomnia.\par \par \uc2 FROM THE MENU\par \par \uc2 Jamon Iberico de Bellota \u163\'00\'A315.50 Quince-glazed Iberico pork ribs \u163\'00\'A37.25 Smoked Basque beefburger \u163\'00\'A36.25 Cod with braised cannellini beans \u163\'00\'A37.25 Mackerel with mussel escabeche \u163\'00\'A36.50 Octopus with pepperonata \u163\'00\'A38.75 Courgette flowers stuffed with goat's cheese \u163\'00\'A34.50 Beetroot and blood-orange salad \u163\'00\'A35.25 TOTAL (inc 12.5% service) \u163\'00\'A366 for two people\par \par \uc2 EMBER YARD\par \par \uc2 60 Berwick Street, Soho, London W1F 8SU; emberyard.co.uk 020 7439 8057 Mon-Sat: noon- midnight; Sun: noon-10.30pm\par \par \uc2 "We tried most of it and you could eat here and think it was a perfectly good Iberianstyle diner, or you could think it was all a fandango with added castanets"\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140223ea2n000jo\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 \u166\'00\'A6 AFTER his short time as [...]\b0\par\par\uc2 ADAM HELLIKER   \par \uc2 89 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Express\par \uc2 THEXSU\par \uc2 1; National\par 35\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) Copyright Express Newspapers 2014   \par \par \uc2 CROSS BENCHER\par \par \uc2 \u166\'00\'A6 AFTER his short time as \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister came to an end when he admitted he had "unwittingly" employed an illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  Mark Harper has time on his hands.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The attack on welfare reform by our leading clerics verges on immoral, says Harriet Sergeant\par \par \uc2 The bishops and the prime minister were eyeballing each other last week over how the state treats the poor. It is about time that politics considered morality. The question is: whose morality? One set of beliefs has become the measure by which a person, a policy or a political party is judged, and it is that of Labour and the left.\par \par \uc2 It is these beliefs that the newly capped Cardinal Vincent Nichols, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, champions. It is right that he and the 27 Anglican bishops, together with the Methodist and Quaker leaders, raised their concerns about the danger of benefit reform creating malnutrition and a "national crisis". My quarrel is with their selectivity.\par \par \uc2 Morality should be about independent thought and hard-fought principles \u8212\'20\'14 especially among the clergy, whose business it is. What we have here is the church coming out for the liberal establishment without a quibble. For a refresher course on morality the clergy should turn instead to those most reliant on the state.\par \par \uc2 For the past five years I have befriended a south London gang. Far from the helping hand envisaged by William Beveridge, these young men see the welfare state as a clunking fist designed to beat them down. They define it as "a liability" that holds you back, rather than "a link" that helps you on in life.\par \par \uc2 This starts with their education. One in five pupils leaves a British secondary school functionally illiterate. What does the clergy think happens to young people who can barely read a Tube map? Half of all prisoners have a reading age of 11 or below. It is not surprising that the young men in the gang looked on their poor education as a conspiracy to keep them impoverished and dependent on the state. Here surely is the stuff of moral outrage yet our clergy remains silent.\par \par \uc2 When the gang members try to get unskilled work \u8212\'20\'14 the only type for which they are qualified \u8212\'20\'14 they find themselves in competition with better-qualified \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , who have not had the drawback of a British state education. Where is the moral outrage from the clergy on behalf of the 917,000 under-25s out of work? In fact, where was the moral outrage from the clergy when \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rose dramatically under the last Labour government to the detriment of the poorest in this country \u8212\'20\'14 many of them former \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  themselves or their children? The clergy appears to have colluded in the belief that it is better to let foreign workers in than risk reforming the benefits system. But this is a benefits system that penalises work and has sidelined generations of young men such as those in my gang.\par \par \uc2 Take what happened when the older brother of one member of the south London gang succeeded in getting a minimum-wage job. After paying emergency tax he found himself almost a third worse off than when he was on benefits and was summoned to court for council tax arrears. After narrowly avoiding prison he will never dare work again.\par \par \uc2 There is a chance, and surely a chance worth taking, that benefit reform would transform the lives of such young men. But it does take political and moral courage. The clergy is right to flag up the dangers but wrong to ignore the chance of doing real good. What will be on offer in your nearest church today? No doubt platitudes about social exclusion, without a grasp of what causes it, followed by prayers for teachers and refugees. The clergy's morality has a limited quality and operates only in an area that sits comfortably within its prejudices.\par \par \uc2 The very public rebuke from the clergy and the archbishop has at least highlighted what may well be the legacy of this government: the bravery and determination of Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith, both churchgoers, to confront and reverse the accepted thinking on poverty, education and benefits. As for my gang members, after a particularly frustrating day trying to get them on a literacy course, I lost my temper. They were astonished. Had I really not known how the state entrapped them? They assumed that everyone, meaning white middle-class taxpayers, knew and colluded. It was obvious to them what the welfare state was for \u8212\'20\'14 a conspiracy to stop the black man getting on, while providing jobs for social workers, probation officers, jobcentre staff and prison officers. As one said: "You want to better yourself but they stop you. Where is the morality in it? There is none. You are just there to feed the system and that's it."\par \par \uc2 Here at least he was on common ground with the archbishop, who, after berating David Cameron, mused: "There must be something wrong with the administration of a system which has that effect on so many people's lives."\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140223ea2n000n1\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 Hunting stag-horn sadist\b0\par\par\uc2 David Stephenson   \par \uc2 951 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Express\par \uc2 THEXSU\par \uc2 1; National\par 56,57\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) Copyright Express Newspapers 2014   \par \par \uc2 TELEVISION\par \par \uc2 TELEVISION is the new Hollywood. It has been for some time. HBO, the American "\uc2 home box office\uc2 " subscription channel, began the revolution with large scale TV dramas, mostly about grumpy men of a certain age.\par \par \uc2 It has now perfected it and rarely offers anything to the viewer which is not comparable with films in the cinema. True Detective (Sky Atlantic, last night) was another fine example of the genre.\par \par \uc2 It has borrowed two reputable and classy Hollywood character actors, Woody Harrelson (Russ) and Matthew McConaughey (Marty) for a bizarre buddy/cop story that is so far from the clich\u233\'00\'E9 that I fully expect them to be tearing each other apart in a fist fight by the end of episode two.\par \par \uc2 Russ is your typical family-man detective, while Marty is an introverted, silent type who has trouble sleeping. I imagine many viewers will share his insomnia, if not nightmares, after watching this drama. It deals with a strange killer in deepest Louisiana with a taste for satanic ritual (aren't they all?). The victim, a woman, was found wearing deer antlers and it was not the result of a fancy dress party.\par \par \uc2 Marty is known as "the taxman" for the large notebook he carries about with him recording odd notes and drawing sketches. In Louisiana that constitutes "weird". He is, however, worryingly OCD. He is also an atheist and something of an amateur philosopher. Russ tells him: "Don't talk about this in these parts."\par \par \uc2 What is the twist? Both are telling the story, separately, but in flashback to 1995. Marty looks to have escaped from rehab while Russ appears to still be employed, or at the very least putting on a good appearance.\par \par \uc2 The Deep South is no stranger to "weirdo", which is why this story has such a compelling feel.\par \par \uc2 Something appears to have gone wrong between the two of them but what? My suspicion is that one night Marty bored Russ to death with his arresting tales of existentialism, at the end of which he bashed him over the head with a life-size cardboard, cut-out of Jean-Paul Sartre.\par \par \uc2 That hoot of a drama Blandings (BBC1, Sunday) has returned for a new series with a spiffingly good performance from that old hand Harry Enfield. Old? If you remember what year he introduced us to Loadsamoney, you can win a free impersonation of dear Kevin the Teenager. Here he played Lord Dunstable, who was so round the twist he must have invented the phrase.\par \par \uc2 He was not best pleased about anything, especially some whistling he could hear. He shouted, with manic authority: "Stop that! You disgusting Scots peasant!" (More political bias from the BBC?).\par \par \uc2 Dunstable was targeting anyone in range: "You bunch of bloater eaters!" We haven't heard that for a while.\par \par \uc2 Blandings has a fabulous cast, including Timothy Spall, Jennifer Saunders and now Tim Vine, although I felt he was a little underdone in the role of the butler. Let's hope he has more to do in future episodes.\par \par \uc2 It was Dunstable, however, who eclipsed all before him with this idle threat: "I will drag your pancreas out through your hat!" Beat that, Holby City.\par \par \uc2 CHANNEL 5's new topical debate series continues to surprise and make Question Time look like a Women's Institute meeting. The latest incarnation was The Big British \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Row (Channel 5, Monday).\par \par \uc2 We will never see the like of it again so I do hope someone took a picture of the panel at one point, which included former prisoner Vicky Pryce, with reality TV show favourites, loudmouth Katie Hopkins and Celebrity Big Brother contestant, Luisa Zissman. Who spoke the most sense, or least nonsense? Zissman, surprisingly. With such extreme views held on both sides of the debate, it was inevitable that a shouting match would ensue but, at the very least, there is merit in these sensitive issues being put to discussion.\par \par \uc2 Two things did surprise me though. First, former Sun editor Kelvin McKenzie supported \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , calling for us to "Hoover them up" across Europe. The second shock was that the \uc2 NHS\uc2  would barely exist if not for foreigners; 30 per cent of doctors have come from abroad, while the figure for nurses is even higher, at 40 per cent. If Britain cannot fill these positions, who will? If the BBC does not make another programme about the First World War, we will be more than satisfied with \uc2 Jeremy Paxman\uc2 's Britain's Great War (Monday, BBC1).\par \par \uc2 The series concluded rather too soon for me last week with a programme which pointed out the upsides of the war. Upsides? Paxman told us that the conflict produced a social revolution in Britain; the poor won better wages and conditions.\par \par \uc2 He also said that the "loss of a generation" was a "myth" as nine out of 10 troops returned. While this may be true, the 10 per cent who died represented some 995,939, with a further 1,600,000 wounded. I suspect we would not have chosen to have a war in order to bring about some form of social revolution.\par \par \uc2 The surprise of the week was Doll & Em (Sky Living HD, Tuesday). Famous daughters Emily Mortimer (father John) and Dolly Wells (father John) have fashioned an Episodes-style comedy which is subtle, funny and well observed.\par \par \uc2 The set-up is that "celebrity" Emily hires her friend Doll as her assistant and dogsbody. The comedy comes from the inevitable strains this puts on their relationship.\par \par \uc2 You won't laugh out loud particularly but you will snort a bit and think: "Remind me never to be employed by a celebrity dear."\par \par \uc2 Document THEXSU0020140223ea2n00070\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich38\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal570

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 BARRY GARDINER has turned politics and climate change into a family affair - and a lucrative one at that.\par \par \uc2 The Brent North MP and wife Caroline live in a large \u163\'00\'A31.2 million detached house in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, which they bought for \u163\'00\'A3700,000 in 2002.\par \par \uc2 In addition to her work as a sculptor and poet, Mrs Gardiner earns an estimated \u163\'00\'A325,000 as her husband's 'part time \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  adviser', as his constituency has a large ethnic population.\par \par \uc2 In the five years since MPs have had to declare family members on their Commons payroll, it is thought she has been paid around \u163\'00\'A3100,000. Until recently, their daughter, Oxford politics graduate Bethany Gardiner-Smith, 26, worked for \uc2 Globe International\uc2 , who funded most of her father's foreign jaunts. She is now adviser to Labour MP Gloria De Piero, who serves alongside Mr Gardiner on Labour's front bench as the Shadow Women's Minister.\par \par \uc2 In addition to all his free travel, Mr Gardiner has found other ways of topping up his \u163\'00\'A366,396 MP's salary.\par \par \uc2 From 2007 to 2010 he received about \u163\'00\'A317,000 a year from Reynolds Partners, an investment bank, as its parliamentary adviser. Mr Gardiner was embroiled in the MPs' expenses scandal in 2009 as he made a \u163\'00\'A3198,500 profit on Westminster flat funded with \u163\'00\'A381,935 in second homes expenses - just \u163\'00\'A314 short of the maximum - in four years. His claims included \u163\'00\'A311,000 for renovations, \u163\'00\'A3235 on bed linen and \u163\'00\'A3248 for a light. All were within Commons rules.\par \par \uc2 Mr Gardiner was told to repay \u163\'00\'A3174 for mortgage interest overpaid - although he voluntarily repaid \u163\'00\'A315,404.\par \par \uc2 Privately educated Mr Gardiner, who studied at Cambridge University and Harvard in the US, entered Parliament in 1997 and was appointed Northern Ireland Minister by Tony Blair in 2005 and Environment Minister in 2006. He stepped down the next year when \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  became Prime Minister but was given the unpaid post of 'special representative on forestry'.\par \par \uc2 Mr Gardiner gave up the role in 2008 when he joined calls for Mr Brown to resign.\par \par \uc2 After Ed Miliband became Labour leader, Mr Gardiner was made Shadow Environment Minister. The job includes the floods portfolio. He is also Mr Miliband's 'special envoy on climate change'.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Mail On Sunday\par \par \uc2 Document MOSM000020140223ea2n0001r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich38\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal570

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 ED Miliband's Labour leadership was ripped to shreds last night in a devastating attack by an MP from his own party.\par \par \uc2 Simon Danczuk made clear he thought Mr Miliband had got it wrong on everything from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to his campaigns on 'One Nation' Britain. And he suggested Mr Miliband's team was feeble compared to Tony Blair's.\par \par \uc2 Outspoken Mr Danczuk added that Mr Miliband's cost-of-living campaign was now 'at the end of its sell-by date'. The Rochdale MP added:\par \par \uc2 l Labour must toughen up on welfare, saying: 'I know people who won't work - and should work.'\par \par \uc2 l Mr Miliband's cherished One Nation slogan is 'over-used and hackneyed'.\par \par \uc2 l Labour had 'got it wrong' on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and been ineffective in how 'to send people back'.\par \par \uc2 l Mr Miliband's Shadow Cabinet is 'one-dimensional' compared to Mr Blair's team of winners.\par \par \uc2 To add insult to injury, Mr Danczuk praised Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and his Coalition deputy Nick Clegg, saying the were 'doing some good'.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with Total Politics magazine, Mr Danczuk poured scorn on Mr Miliband's 'cost-of-living' slogan, saying: 'It is probably coming to the end of its sell-by date, isn't it? People get turned off by it.'\par \par \uc2 He also stepped up his attack on Mr Miliband's One Nation crusade, the much vaunted centrepiece of his leader's 2012 Labour conference speech.\par \par \uc2 Mr Danczuk, who last month suggested the crusade was 'vacuous', said 'significant' Labour figures did not like it. He said: 'One Nation isn't tied to anything, is it? It was a great speech, but it's over-used, hackneyed.'\par \par \uc2 The MP ridiculed spin-off Labour campaigns on 'One Nation Social Security' and 'One Nation Banking'.\par \par \uc2 'For goodness sake! If I went round talking like that on the doorstep, I'd get short shrift. You'd see doors being slammed in your face.'\par \par \uc2 The MP warned Mr Miliband not to oppose all the Coalition's welfare reforms - and said Labour should be far tougher on benefits reform.\par \par \uc2 Politics that allows endless benefits spending was 'too comfortable, too easy for people on the Left', he said, adding bluntly: 'Where's the money going to come from? I know people who won't work and should work.'\par \par \uc2 In a jibe apparently aimed at the Labour leadership, he continued: 'If a politician doesn't know anybody like that, then they need to get out more because they're not in touch with reality.'\par \par \uc2 But he singled out the Coalition for praise on welfare.\par \par \uc2 'They [the Coalition] are doing some good . . . I welcome some of that. You can't just throw the baby out with the bathwater and say everything they're doing is bad.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Danczuk was just as scathing about Labour's failure to speak out on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . 'The Labour Government were far too relaxed on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  . . . We've never had a system that's been effective in sending people back. We should've been much more on the ball. We got it wrong,' he said.\par \par \uc2 Implying that Mr Miliband's Shadow Cabinet was not a patch on Mr Blair's line-up, he said the former PM 'built a team around him that played to their strengths which made Labour more electable' while Mr Miliband's was too 'one-dimensional'.\par \par \uc2 Mr Danczuk attacked \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 , Mr Miliband's predecessor as Labour leader, over the notorious 2010 Election campaign incident involving Rochdale Labour pensioner Gillian Duffy. Mr Danczuk's campaign was almost derailed when Mr Brown branded Mrs Duffy a 'bigoted woman' in a conversation between him and an aide recorded on tape after she questioned him over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The MP claimed Labour aides wrongly blamed him for the incident.\par \par \uc2 'He [Mr Brown] hasn't apologised to me at any stage,' said Mr Danczuk.\par \par \uc2 'You'd have thought he would. I'd have said sorry if I were him,' the MP added.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Mail On Sunday\par \par \uc2 Document MOSM000020140223ea2n0002f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 LABOUR, the Conservatives and Lib Dems are to promise Scots greater tax powers for Holyrood in the event of a No vote in September to try to erode nationalist support.\par \par \uc2 With the polls narrowing, all three are believed to favour MSPs becoming responsible for at least 50% of the parliament's \u163\'00\'A335bn budget. The devolved parliament is responsible for less than 15% of its budget.\par \par \uc2 Following a meeting of an internal commission last week, Labour is expected to unveil proposals next month for "significant" devolution of income tax which could hand MSPs power to decide the rates and bands of income tax.\par \par \uc2 Air passenger, vehicle excise duties and aspects of welfare are also expected to come under Scottish control under the plans.\par \par \uc2 Tory sources say Scottish leader Ruth Davidson will pledge greater fiscal responsibility when their internal review team reports in May.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dem offer may be the most wide-ranging of all, letting Scotland raise around two-thirds of its budget, collecting almost all income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax and air passenger duty.\par \par \uc2 The latest Scottish polling has put the No campaign's lead down to about 10 points, putting unionists under pressure to set out a positive alternative to independence. It follows Chancellor \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 's threat to ban Scotland from using the pound in the event of a Yes vote in September's referendum, which nationalists claim has backfired.\par \par \uc2 An SNP-commissioned Panelbase poll today puts No on 47% (-2 since the company polled two weeks ago) and Yes on 37 (unchanged), with 16% undecided (+2) \u8212\'20\'14 described by deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon as "very encouraging".\par \par \uc2 The warnings on sterling from Osborne, Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander and shadow chancellor Ed Balls are widely felt to have benefited the Yes camp (43%) more than the No campaign (25%), although unionists believe that it will help them in the long run.\par \par \uc2 However, a YouGov poll for The Sunday Times today finds that in England and Wales more people than not believe the opposite, with 28% thinking the Westminster intevention makes a Yes vote less likely and only 14% considering it more likely. But 58% of people in England and Wales would oppose an independent Scotland remaining in a currency union with them.\par \par \uc2 The Scottish government has threatened to refuse to shoulder a share of UK national debt unless such an arrangement applies.\par \par \uc2 Today it claims this would saddle English taxpayers with up to \u163\'00\'A3130bn in extra debt and up to \u163\'00\'A35.5bn a year in additional interest payments \u8212\'20\'14 equivalent to increasing the basic rateContinued on page 7 ?? WW Tax powers on the table Continued from page 1 ?? of income tax in the rest of the UK by one pence.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  is under pressure to debate independence with \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  when they take their cabinets to the northeast of Scotland tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 With the pair coming within 10 miles of each other on the outskirts of the Aberdeen, today's Panelbase poll indicates two-thirds of voters back a televised head-to-head for the occasion.\par \par \uc2 The prime minister has so far resisted the temptation, insisting the debate should be among the people of Scotland. Instead Cameron intends to use his visit to set out plans to strengthen the North Sea oil and gas industry within the Union, claiming it benefits from the UK's "broad shoulders".\par \par \uc2 Senior Labour, Lib Dem and Tory sources believe a clear commitment on more devolution before voters go to the polls will boost the prospect of a solid No vote in the referendum. Under the unionist party plans, defence and foreign affairs, along with corporation tax and VAT is expected to remain with Westminster.\par \par \uc2 The Labour commission's proposals have encountered resistance from some of its MPs who fear they will play into nationalist hands. However, senior party sources say the Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont has won her battle to make a commitment to substantial extra devolution.\par \par \uc2 Dave Watson\uc2 , a former Scottish Labour chairman and a senior \uc2 Unison union\uc2  official, said "the few siren voices" claiming more devolution would lead to independence are "stuck in a 1970's time warp".\par \par \uc2 Writing in The Sunday Times, he adds: "All the polls make it clear that the majority of Scots want greater devolution short of outright independence.\par \par \uc2 "Scottish Labour has to go with that majority by arguing for the fiscal powers that can help deliver a vision of the fairer and more equal society. Anything short of that really would encourage a drift to independence."\par \par \uc2 A draft of a proposed unionist cross-party agreement on more devolution, seen by The Sunday Times, suggests all three parties are prepared to let the Scottish parliament raise at least half of what it spends although they are not expected to make a formal detailed cross-party agreement before the referendum.\par \par \uc2 Under the proposal, drawn up by the cross-party campaign group Devo Plus which has members on each of the party's devolution commissions, Westminster would retain power over defence, foreign policy, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and monetary policy. The Queen would also remain head of state in Scotland.\par \par \uc2 Scotland would keep its 59 largely Labour MPs at Westminster in the event of further devolution, in a substantial concession to Ed Miliband's party.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Tories have claimed an independent Scotland would be "forced" by Europe to apply VAT on a whole range of products which are currently exempt from the charge. The party said a Yes vote would leave Scotland facing a "massive tax bombshell" which would have an impact on businesses and families across the country.\par \par \uc2 Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson has now challenged Salmond to "tell us fairly and squarely" what VAT rates would be charged on those items which currently have a zero VAT rate.\par \par \uc2 She made the demand after a letter from Donato Raponi, the head of the VAT unit at the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 , said that member states of the \uc2 European Union\uc2  "must apply" EU rules on VAT.\par \par \uc2 A Scottish government spokesman described the Tory claims as "preposterous scaremongering" and said an independent Scotland would negotiate continued membership of the EU from within the organisation.\par \par \uc2 The Tories say the UK could apply zero VAT rates on 54 areas because of a longstanding agreement with Europe. It means that shoppers here do not pay the charge on items such as newspapers, books, some foods, equipment for the disabled and children's clothes.\par \par \uc2 It came as the Public and Commercial Services \u8212\'20\'14 one of Scotland's largest trade unions \u8212\'20\'14 yesterday voted to remain neutral in the independence debate, despite nationalist hopes it would join the Yes campaign.\par \par \uc2 The union represents about 30,000 civil servants in Scotland.\par \par \uc2 Fiscal devolution is the simplest way to reduce inequality, page 25\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140223ea2n000zd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Folliwing BBC Two controller \uc2 Janice Hadlow\uc2 's abrupt departure, Neil Midgley wonders about the channel's future.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Neil Midgley   \par \uc2 938 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par 08:00\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Of all the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s TV channels, BBC Two is in the rudest health. Its clever documentaries chime with critics and viewers alike; it has a resurgent drama slate, including {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10111545/The-Fall-BBC-Two-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 The Fall}}}\uc2  and Peaky Blinders ; and, of course, it gave us {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10396751/The-Great-British-Bake-Off-final-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 The Great British Bake Off}}}\uc2  . All of which makes it rather mysterious that its controller, \uc2 Janice Hadlow\uc2 , is leaving the channel \u8211\'20\'13 without an obviously alluring job to go to.\par \par \uc2 Though the BBC says it was \u8220\'20\'1Cvery much" Hadlow\u8217\'20\'19s decision to step down, the corporation has created a new (and ill-defined) job for her out of nowhere \u8211\'20\'13 a tactic that director-general \uc2 Tony Hall\uc2  has used a number of times, when he has wanted to ease senior managers out of front-line jobs. But unlike, say, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9628229/Newsnight-editor-Peter-Rippon-played-down-importance-of-Jimmy-Savile-allegations-claims-leaked-email.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 former Newsnight editor Peter Rippon}}}\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 who was moved away from that programme after the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9607133/How-Jimmy-Savile-master-manipulator-evaded-exposure-as-a-paedophile.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Jimmy Savile debacle}}}\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 Hadlow does not leave a poisoned chalice for her successor.\par \par \uc2 BBC Two\u8217\'20\'19s current success contrasts starkly with its poor form when Hadlow took over in 2008. She was promoted from running BBC Four, a channel for which Hadlow coined the mantra \u8220\'20\'1Cclever pleasure". BBC Four and its digital sibling BBC Three had stolen so many of BBC Two\u8217\'20\'19s clothes \u8211\'20\'13 taking both younger viewers and the more intellectual ones \u8211\'20\'13 that it was increasingly unclear why the BBC was spending the thick end of \u163\'00\'A3500 million a year on the older channel.\par \par \uc2 What Hadlow has done, quietly but deftly, is to give BBC Two a new confidence in presenting brainy topics to a mass audience. Even Bake Off, BBC Two\u8217\'20\'19s biggest hit by far in 2013, isn\u8217\'20\'19t as light as it might appear. According to the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s head of documentaries, Emma Willis, Bake Off\u8217\'20\'19s success depends on taking the anatomy of a sponge cake \u8220\'20\'1Cas seriously as the anatomy of a murder". The result is that, when viewers finish watching an episode, they have not only been thoroughly entertained \u8211\'20\'13 they also feel a smidgeon more intelligent.\par \par \uc2 Hadlow also had a stroke of luck when the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s arcane budgeting process gave her a new pot of money to spend on drama. She and drama chief \uc2 Ben Stephenson\uc2  have, however, produced a run of successes that can\u8217\'20\'19t be put down just to chance. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10570710/Line-of-Duty-Back-with-a-bang.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Line of Duty – currently on its second series}}}\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 is a standard cop show, but impressed critics with its sophistication and ambiguity. The Fall, ostensibly another genre piece, also played with viewers\u8217\'20\'19 traditional loyalties by presenting Gillian Anderson as a cold-hearted police detective \u8211\'20\'13 and Jamie Dornan as a knee-weakeningly handsome serial killer.\par \par \uc2 REVIEW: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10634482/Line-of-Duty-series-two-BBC-Two-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Line of Duty, series two, BBC Two}}}\par \par \uc2 However, whoever Hadlow\u8217\'20\'19s successor is (Adam Barker has just been announced as the Acting Controller of both BBC Two and BBC Four), they will inherit an in-tray that contains some chunky challenges as well.\par \par \uc2 By taking the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10148031/Kate-Humble-on-life-beyond-Springwatch.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Springwatch}}}\uc2  format that she inherited, and morphing it into a whole raft of live factual events, Hadlow effectively created a new genre of programmes for BBC Two. But after {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/10418784/Chris-Packham-sneaks-war-film-titles-into-BBCs-Autumnwatch.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Autumnwatch}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/10589575/Fox-sets-new-record-after-being-tracked-nearly-200-miles.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Winterwatch}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8434649/Lambing-Live-BBC-Two-review-what-a-piece-of-work-is-a-lamb.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Lambing Live}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9787652/Stargazing-Live-BBC-Two-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Stargazing Live}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/activityandadventure/9380845/Volcano-Live-Kate-Humble-visits-Eyjafjallajokull.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Volcano Live}}}\uc2  and (the widely panned) Airport Live, the new BBC Two chief might have to come up with their own brilliant idea \u8211\'20\'13 unless they want their first commission to be Dead Horse Flogging Live.\par \par \uc2 Hadlow\u8217\'20\'19s personal passion is history \u8211\'20\'13 she\u8217\'20\'19s just written a book about the family life of George III, out in May. That has made BBC Two\u8217\'20\'19s history films particularly strong, but at the expense of more contemporary themes. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10429984/Dan-Snow-on-his-favourite-historical-days-out.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Dan Snow}}}\uc2 , for example, has been despatched to make {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9923072/A-History-of-Syria-with-Dan-Snow-BBC-Two-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 films about the history of Syria}}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10608302/Dan-Snows-History-of-the-Winter-Olympics-BBC-Two-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 the history of the Winter Olympics}}}\uc2  . By contrast Channel 4 has treated the same topics much more vividly, hoovering up awards for Olly Lambert\u8217\'20\'19s reportage in Syria: Across the Lines, and showing the vile face of today\u8217\'20\'19s anti-gay bigotry in Russia with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/winter-olympics/10632071/What-about-Britains-gingers-Russia-attacks-Channel-4-over-gay-rights-film.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Liz Mackean’s Hunted}}}\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 REVIEW: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10001821/Syria-Across-the-Lines-Channel-4-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  Syria, Across the Lines, Channel 4 }}}\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s current-affairs output has yet to emerge from the shadow cast on its investigative reporting by the Savile crisis. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10644155/Benefits-Street-The-Last-Word-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Channel 4’s Benefits Street}}}\uc2 may have divided opinion, but it created a genuine debate about one of modern Britain\u8217\'20\'19s most divisive issues. By contrast, BBC Two\u8217\'20\'19s authored documentaries \u8211\'20\'13 Nick Robinson on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , \uc2 Robert Peston\uc2  on China \u8211\'20\'13 are beautifully made and argued, but hardly visceral.\par \par \uc2 And Hadlow\u8217\'20\'19s successor inherits a smaller, but possibly more intractable, problem: BBC Four. That niche channel now comes under the remit of the BBC Two controller. The BBC has scandalously vandalised BBC Four over recent years, denuding it of its popular drama output and forcing it to focus on increasingly dreary arts documentaries.

After the general election next year, \uc2 Tony Hall\uc2  will have to dive straight into negotiations with the Government about the renewal of the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s charter, expiring in 2016.

\par\par \b \uc2 UK migration committee to unveil proposal for 'visa auctions'\b0\par\par\uc2 By Helen Warrell, Public Policy Correspondent   \par \uc2 679 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par 15:07\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Droposals due to be unveiled this week would allow UK visas to be auctioned off to the highest bidders, despite criticism from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  lawyers that this would create an "\uc2 eBay\uc2  culture" for permanent residence in Britain.\par \par \uc2 Under current rules, overseas investors can pay \u163\'00\'A31m, \u163\'00\'A35m or \u163\'00\'A310m to speed up the grant of the right to live permanently in Britain. Depending on the amount paid, the process takes from two to five years. Applicants who cannot afford investor visas must comply with strict requirements depending on what job they are seeking, how much they will be paid, or whether they have a family member who can prove they can earn enough to support them.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 the Migration Advisory Committee\uc2  has been scrutinising these arrangements following Home Office concerns that the investments - usually made in Gilts, or as a loan to the applicant's own business - are not sufficiently beneficial to the UK economy. The programme has proved popular with Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern families seeking a safe haven from political unrest such as the Arab spring.\par \par \uc2 Having reviewed the evidence Sir David Metcalf, chair of the committee, will on Tuesday publish a range of options such as auctioning off a set number of investor visas each year, as well as recasting the million-pound investments as "endowments" to universities.\par \par \uc2 However, the auction proposal is already understood to have met significant scepticism from within the Home Office and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.\par \par \uc2 The idea comes at a sensitive time, given that recent proposals by the \uc2 Maltese government\uc2  to sell off passports for \u8364\'20\'AC650,000 each have been slammed by fellow EU members concerned that the scheme would turn citizenship into a "tradeable commodity".\par \par \uc2 Malta's plan sparked particular controversy because, unlike the UK investor programme, it would not require applicants to be resident on the island in order to be granted a passport, which would allow immediate rights of settlement in all EU member states.\par \par \uc2 The Home Office has been careful not to criticise the Maltese scheme, with former \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister Mark Harper telling MPs in December that citizenship was a sovereign issue for each individual country to consider. "I would not be very happy if other European countries tried to tell us who could be citizens of Britain," he said. But ministers are thought to be wary of introducing visa auctions in the UK so close to the general election.\par \par \uc2 The number of investor visas issued by the Home Office rose from 423 in 2011-12 to 530 in 2012-13, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The majority were issued to Chinese applicants, with Russians and Americans not far behind.\par \par \uc2 The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.\par \par \uc2 <>But despite the rising demand, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  lawyers representing wealthy foreign clients have universally criticised the auction proposal. Nick Rollason, head of business \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at Kingsley Napley, warned that this would create an "\uc2 eBay\uc2  culture" for handing out visas. "It will also leave a bad taste in the mouths of the British public," he said.\par \par \uc2 Julia Onslow-Cole, head of global \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at PwC Legal, says the current system of a set investment threshold, which has to be maintained for the duration of the visa, was more beneficial to the economy than a one-off payment. "Selling visas to the highest bidder, thereby treating them as a commodity, does not guarantee that they will continue to invest in the UK," she said.\par \par \uc2 Kamal Rahman, head of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at \uc2 Mishcon de Reya\uc2 , said the most important thing was to find an efficient way of channelling money to boost growth.\par \par \uc2 "Philosophically, the idea of directing investors into areas of public services where finance is most needed is not controversial, but the system has got to be clear and simple for clients and there is also the question of who would manage and monitor any new fund," Ms Rahman said.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140223ea2n001uq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

In every nation state we are having to adapt to those pressures and it's very important the EU does so as well.\par \par \uc2 "So we will be discussing the ideas that we have in common and, as you know, it's our intention after the next general election to improve Britain's relationship with the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , to renegotiate the relationship between Britain and the EU and improve the EU along the lines I have spoken so we can give people a choice in a referendum by the end of 2017 about staying in or leaving the \uc2 European Union\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Asked whether reform of the free movement rules would be on the agenda, Mr Hague said: "I' m sure these subjects will come up. Germany also has strict benefit rules, Germany does not want its benefits system to be abused.\par \par \uc2 "We support the principle of the free movement of workers, and many British people have rightly taken advantage of that in the rest of Europe.\par \par \uc2 "But we don't support people moving from one country to another because of the incentives of different benefit systems.\par \par \uc2 "With Germany we have a lot of common ground on that and there will be no problem discussing that."\par \par \uc2 The tone of the visit will be in marked contrast to the meeting between the Prime Minister and Francois Hollande at RAF Brize Norton last month, where the two leaders discussed EU reform over a pub lunch following a summit overshadowed by questions about the French president's private life.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hague said: "This is a different sort of visit from the French visit in January, that was a short summit to discuss our bilateral defence and security co-operation.\par \par \uc2 "This is a more wide-ranging visit from Angela Merkel.\par \par \uc2 "Germany is our most important partner on seeking reform in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  because it's Germany that has such a strong position in the eurozone, that has managed to maintain a dynamic economy itself. Germany is in that key position in the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Our relations with Germany are very important, our relations with Angela Merkel are very good and we want, together, to make sure that Europe is more competitive, more flexible, more democratically accountable than it is today.\par \par \uc2 "Those are the sorts of ideas we will be discussing with chancellor Merkel."\par \par \uc2 Asked whether the process of renegotiating the UK's ties with Brussels had begun, Mr Hague said: "The negotiation of the changes that I'm talking about is for after the next general election.\par \par \uc2 "But we are establishing the common ground with Germany, with the Netherlands, for instance, where their government has issued a report talking about 'Europe where necessary, but national wherever possible'. That is a good guiding thought and it's one on which we can work with the Dutch."\par \par \uc2 Mr Hague added: " People will have the choice and that negotiation will have to take place.

\par\par \b \uc2 Merkel calls for Britain to remain at heart of Europe\b0\par\par\uc2 By Stefan Wagstyl   \par \uc2 709 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par 18:06\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 German chancellor \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  will urge Britain to ignore the eurosceptics and stay at the heart of the EU in a speech to both houses of Parliament on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 But during her one-day working visit to Britain, she is unlikely to make significant concessions to prime minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  on his key concerns, including \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  curbs and changes to EU treaties to return powers from Brussels.\par \par \uc2 "Germany and the UK are, for each other, important partners - not only bilaterally but in Europe," said Steffen Seibert, Ms Merkel's spokesman. "That will naturally be a theme of the visit . . . we want an active, strong UK in the EU."\par \par \uc2 Ms Merkel will highlight this in her speech, the first by a German leader to both houses since 1986. She will then have lunch with Mr Cameron before taking tea with the Queen at Buckingham Palace, returning to Berlin in the early evening.\par \par \uc2 Ms Merkel will be getting "the reddest of red carpets", in the words of one British official. London hopes the lavish welcome could encourage Berlin to be more accommodating to Mr Cameron's demands for EU reforms, including his hopes of diluting the union's powers and curbing migration to appease eurosceptics at home.\par \par \uc2 William Hague, foreign secretary, said on Sunday the government planned to use Ms Merkel's visit to try to persuade Berlin to support measures discouraging people from moving within the EU to access other nations' welfare systems.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hague said on Sunday that he believed the Germans and British shared "common ground" over concerns about benefit tourism within the EU.\par \par \uc2 "We support the principle of free movement . . . but we don't support people moving from one country to another because of the incentives of different benefit systems," Mr Hague told BBC1's \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show. "And I think again with Germany we have a lot of common ground on that and there will be no problem discussing that."\par \par \uc2 Officials in Berlin also hope Ms Merkel will press Mr Cameron to spell out exactly what concessions he wants from the EU as the price for staying in.\par \par \uc2 A German foreign policy expert said: "The UK lacks a consensus on what it wants from the EU. Outsiders like Germany cannot get a clear idea of what the UK actually wants."\par \par \uc2 Ms Merkel shares some of Mr Cameron's views on the EU. Like him, she wants to trim the powers of the Brussels bureaucracy and defends the market economy against criticism from countries that favour a state-led approach, notably France.\par \par \uc2 Britain sees Berlin as a possible ally in its bid to change some of the EU's key treaties because Germany has also spoken of treaty change, albeit in the opposite direction - to boost the key institutions of the eurozone.\par \par \uc2 But German officials are wary about starting treaty change talks for fear of opening a Pandora's box of demands from 28 countries. They also say Berlin's plans for closer integration in the eurozone and London's proposals for a looser union outside the eurozone could be incompatible.\par \par \uc2 Ms Merkel may give Mr Cameron some comfort on combating welfare abuse by EU migrants: members of her conservative CDU and its CSU have called for action. But, unlike Mr Cameron, the chancellor is a firm supporter of intra-EU migration.\par \par \uc2 German officials say there can be no question of reimposing migration controls on the bloc's newest members, Romania and Bulgaria. Mr Cameron has threatened to veto the entry of future new member states like Serbia and Albania unless new migrant curbs are agreed but there is little interest in Berlin in even discussing this.\par \par \uc2 Berlin is worried that Britain is moving down a road that could, with a planned referendum on EU membership, result in its leaving the union.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Matussek, a former ambassador to the UK and now head of the Alfred Herrhausen Society, a think-tank, says: "We would like to help to keep Britain inside. But we can only keep the door open. Walking through the door must be done by the British themselves."\par \par \uc2 Ms Merkel is likely to make the same point.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Beth Rigby\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140223ea2n002uv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg will have his work cut out when he goes head-to-head with Nigel Farage in a debate on Britain\u8217\'20\'19s membership of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , a senior Lib Dem colleague has warned.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dem leader challenged Mr Farage to a public debate on the EU last week, with the UKIP leader responding by saying that he had \u8220\'20\'1Cabsolutely no choice" but to pick up the gauntlet.\par \par \uc2 Simon Hughes\uc2 , former deputy leader of the Lib Dems, admitted today however that it would be a \u8220\'20\'1Ctough gig" for Mr Clegg.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COf all the people that\u8217\'20\'19s equipped to know the history and the workings of the EU and its benefits and has also had to argue this case lately, I think Nick is hugely well qualified," he said on the \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show on BBC One.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHe can speak as a solid Brit who understands the benefits. I think it will be great television."\par \par \uc2 He added, however: \u8220\'20\'1CIt will be a tough gig and he knows that, and Nigel is a difficult opponent, but Nick has never been afraid. He wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be in government with the Tories if he was afraid of tough gigs."\par \par \uc2 Lord Heseltine, the Tory grandee and former Cabinet minister, went even further, suggesting that Mr Clegg should not be giving UKIP legitimacy by holding the debate.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t do it if I was him [Mr Clegg]," Lord Heseltine said. \u8220\'20\'1CI think that it\u8217\'20\'19s a misjudgment, frankly, to equate the leadership of a party which is part of government with a protest group, particularly a protest group which, frankly, is more about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  than it is about Europe."\par \par \uc2 He said that UKIP should be treated the way Margaret Thatcher\u8217\'20\'19s Government treated the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere were things that are worth doing about UKIP \u8212\'20\'14 the first of all is to tell people what UKIP is really about.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe way to do that, of course, is to stop talking about the United Kingdom Independence Party and start talking about the United Kingdom isolationist party.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s exactly what we did with the CND in about 1983, I think it was. We stopped talking about the campaign for nuclear disarmament and started talking about one-sided disarmament ... and everybody realised then what it meant."\par \par \uc2 The Clegg-Farage debate, set to take place next month, is likely to increase the number of calls for Mr Farage to be included in future leaders\u8217\'20\'19 televised debates before the 2015 general election.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and Ed Miliband look unlikely to take part in the Europe debate, because both face divisions within their own parties over the issue. Mr Farage said that he \u8220\'20\'1Cnearly choked on my bacon roll" when he heard Mr Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s challenge.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAt no point in the 15 years that I\u8217\'20\'19ve now been an MEP ... have we ever had a full national debate about the merits or demerits of EU membership," he said last week.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140223ea2n002jr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 During the last US presidential election, the then-rising Republican star Chris Christie delivered a typically impassioned speech to his party's national convention. Seizing his moment in the spotlight, he proclaimed that he did not want his children and grandchildren to have to read in history books what it was like to live in an American Century. "I want them to live in a Second American Century," he said.\par \par \uc2 Conventional wisdom states the game is up for the US and its western allies which together dominated the globe over the last century. They have had their time; now they are slipping into the sunset as the likes of China, India and Brazil roar past them into global prominence. Most particularly, China's return to the top spot as the world's greatest power is seen as leading to consequent decay and decline in the increasingly impotent west.\par \par \uc2 Charles Kenny\uc2 , an irrepressibly optimistic and refreshingly free-thinking British economist, sees the shape of this emerging world rather differently. For a start, he thinks the US should learn from the post-imperial British experience by adopting a more collegiate approach to global affairs while discovering new strengths. More fundamentally, he argues that just because one nation is winning does not mean another must lose; instead, he shows convincingly how the benefits of success spread far beyond borders.\par \par \uc2 The Upside of Down is clearly aimed at an American audience, trying to reassure a fretful nation in danger of retreating back into isolationism. Their concerns are understandable. Some experts say China has already overtaken the US on certain measures of economic size; regardless, by the end of the next decade the Asian superpower is expected to account for twice as much of the global economy as its wilting rival. And the speed of this change is simply incredible. GM sold one car in China for every 10 it sold in the US in 2004; just five years later, the ratio was approaching one-to-one.\par \par \uc2 Kenny, who is based at a Washington think-tank, reminds readers that being the wealthiest place on Earth has not made the US the happiest or healthiest nation; for instance, it comes only 47th in the rankings of infant survival. Yet his statistic-laden polemic is ultimately a glorious hymn to the transformative powers of globalisation, showing the beneficial impact for everyone as countries become richer, healthier and smarter. Even in some of the most wrecked countries of the world such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, we can clearly see education improving and infant mortality declining.\par \par \uc2 In many ways this short, rather clumsily titled book could be viewed as the second part of Getting Better, his highly influential previous work that punctured the doom and gloom surrounding global development and was beloved by \uc2 Bill Gates\uc2 . The author shows how advances in one place's wealth and wellbeing are more likely to enhance than hamper progress elsewhere, leading to business innovations, medical breakthroughs, new technologies and greater wealth. He says correctly that this shows the folly of adopting a fortress mentality, whether preventing the free flow of capital, goods or people.\par \par \uc2 Even on purely mercantile grounds pulling up the portcullis makes no sense, given the opportunities that abound in this rapidly changing world. Three decades ago, Chinese consumption of beer was minimal; today, the country consumes more than 40bn litres. Its market for luxury goods is growing more than one third each year, while it is sending soaring numbers of students abroad to study and opening up its health services to foreign firms. Worldwide, spending on medicine is nearly doubling in a decade.\par \par \uc2 Although it feels something of a byway, there is also a fine demolition of the arguments against open borders - not least since the workforce in the west will shrink by some 100 million people at a time of ageing populations. This failure to allow more migrants into the west is delaying economic recovery and costing jobs, while the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system "looks like it was designed by a failing-grade student of Soviet planning". Among his solutions is the suggestion of selling citizenship, with loans for migrants from low-income countries.\par \par \uc2 There are, of course, warnings that the world cannot sustain this rising population or growing wealth. Kenny uses his battering ram of facts and figures to put the counter view, showing how predictions of crises are constantly thwarted by new technologies and discoveries. Copper reserves, for instance, in 2010 were more than double the 1970 estimates, while cereal yields rose at more than twice the rate of population growth in the developing world in the first decade of this century. He also highlights China's leading role in renewable energy.\par \par \uc2 For all his positivity, though, he fails to demolish totally concerns over climate change and water shortages, while placing too much faith in international institutions. He is also too sanguine about state-led misuse of Chinese technologies, demanding less mistrust of its leading firms in this field. But these are minor quibbles in a timely counter to the relativist global race narrative. As he says, one minute we are told the developing world is stealing jobs and overtaking our economies with unfair competition, the next that it is a starving morass left helpless without our aid or intervention. Once again, Kenny offers a powerful antidote to the poisonous pessimism that prevails in too many places.\par \par \uc2 To buy The Upside of Down for pounds 17.99 with free UK p&p call 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 A competitor in a Chinese beer-drinking competition.

Merkel's visit is an opportunity to start those discussions."\par \par \uc2 Other countries likely to be favourable to reform include the Netherlands and several in Scandinavia.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Foreign Secretary William Hague says the EU must be more accountable [EPA]\par \par \uc2 Today Foreign Secretary William Hague acknowledged that Germany was the "most important partner" on seeking EU reform because of its economic strength and key role in the eurozone. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Speaking of Mrs Merkel, he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: "She knows, and I believe she understands, what our Prime Minister David Cameron has been putting forward, that this is the age - the 21st century is the age - of flexibility, accountability and competitiveness.\par \par \uc2 "And the \uc2 European Union\uc2  cannot be immune from those things. In every nation state we are having to adapt to those pressures and it's very important the EU does so as well."\par \par \uc2 He said discussions had not yet started with Brussels ahead of a planned EU referendum by the end of 2017.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Asked whether reform of the free movement rules would be on the agenda during Thursday's trip, Mr Hague said: "I'm sure these subjects will come up. Germany also has strict benefit rules, Germany does not want its benefits system to be abused.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "We support the principle of the free movement of workers, and many British people have rightly taken advantage of that in the rest of Europe.\par \par \uc2 "But we don't support people moving from one country to another because of the incentives of different benefit systems.\par \par \uc2 "With Germany we have a lot of common ground on that and there will be no problem discussing that."\par \par \uc2 He added: "Germany is our most important partner on seeking reform in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  because it's Germany that has such a strong position in the eurozone, that has managed to maintain a dynamic economy itself. Germany is in that key position in the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The tone of the visit will be in marked contrast to the meeting between the Prime Minister and Francois Hollande at RAF Brize Norton last month, where the two leaders discussed EU reform over a pub lunch following a summit overshadowed by questions about the French president's private life.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140223ea2n003s5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Frontpage\par \b \uc2 Privacy guardian Christopher Graham finds himself in the public eye; Christopher Graham\u8217\'20\'19s role as information commissioner has seen him achieve a level of recognition he didn\u8217\'20\'19t expect when he took the job in 2009 \u8211\'20\'13 but he\u8217\'20\'19s signed up for another two years, says Ian Burrell\b0\par\par\uc2 Ian Burrell   \par \uc2 1,212 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par 20:01\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 For a guardian of the nation\u8217\'20\'19s privacy, Christopher Graham is having to grow used to incursions into his own personal space as the public confronts him on buses and in hotel lobbies with concerns over the safety of their intimate details.\par \par \uc2 The information commissioner didn\u8217\'20\'19t expect this\u160\'00\'A0 level of recognition when he took the job in 2009 but his tenure in what had previously been a relatively low-key post has coincided with a data revolution.\par \par \uc2 Mr Graham, 63, finds himself interviewed on television about lost medical records, and summoned to the Leveson Inquiry to answer questions about private investigators \u8220\'20\'1Cblagging" secrets from banks and phone companies. His office has been front-page news after The Independent\u8217\'20\'19s revelations that blue-chip companies are accused of illegally obtaining the public\u8217\'20\'19s private information.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s top of people\u8217\'20\'19s agenda \u8211\'20\'13 both citizens and politicians and businesses. Everyone wants to know what the information commissioner is going to do," he says. Clearly he has enjoyed the experience, because last week it was quietly confirmed that he has signed up for a further two years in the role.\par \par \uc2 But that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t mean he thinks he has the tools to do what is an increasingly demanding job. He has \u8220\'20\'1Cpretty limited powers" and is frustrated that some of his office\u8217\'20\'19s recent prosecutions have been thrown out.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI had one of our fines struck down the other day because I couldn\u8217\'20\'19t prove that dumping all the pensions records in the recycling area of the local supermarket was going to cause serious damage or distress," he complains, of an attempted prosecution of Scottish Borders council. \u8220\'20\'1CI couldn\u8217\'20\'19t prove that someone of malicious intent had picked up all this personal information and was going to be doing people down."\par \par \uc2 The information tribunal also rejected his office\u8217\'20\'19s attempts to prosecute Tetrus Telecoms for sending thousands of spam text messages because the judge didn\u8217\'20\'19t accept that substantial damage and distress had been caused.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe could show there was nuisance \u8211\'20\'13 that isn\u8217\'20\'19t enough apparently," says the commissioner. \u8220\'20\'1CWe have just got to lower that hurdle because I think if you ask most people they would say silent calls and unsolicited spam texts are one of the great curses of the age \u8211\'20\'13 and if the Information Commissioner can\u8217\'20\'19t protect you it\u8217\'20\'19s a poor lookout."\par \par \uc2 Under data-protection laws, the \uc2 Information Commissioner\u8217\'20\'19s Office\uc2  (ICO) can only bring monetary penalties. Even the criminal offence of unauthorised disclosure or obtaining of personal information (Section 55 of the Data Protection Act) carries only a fine and is often dealt with by a magistrate.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe track record in the magistrates court is pretty pathetic," says Mr Graham. If people don\u8217\'20\'19t think this sort of thing matters and if you get to the magistrates court you will be fined about \u163\'00\'A3120, not surprisingly the public doesn\u8217\'20\'19t have great confidence that their personal information will stay secure."\par \par \uc2 This lack of confidence, he says, has huge implications for the Government\u8217\'20\'19s plans to improve public-sector\u160\'00\'A0 efficiency by moving\u160\'00\'A0 services online.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf you don\u8217\'20\'19t have confidence in the way data controllers will handle all the information they are bound to hold on us these days because we are doing everything online then \u8211\'20\'13 surprise, surprise \u8211\'20\'13 you don\u8217\'20\'19t have the public confidence for the big data-sharing initiatives that the Government wants to see in the public service."\par \par \uc2 Read more: \uc2 FBI\uc2  will be asked to investigate corporations accused of illegally accessing data on private individualsBBC duped into handing over confidential data on 700 licence-fee payers to \u8216\'20\'18blaggers\u8217\'20\'19MPs \u8216\'20\'18baffled\u8217\'20\'19 as former Soca agents asked to probe scandal it ignoredBlue-chip hacking scandal - at last, the investigations into those on Soca list begin\par \par \uc2 More serious cases of information theft \u8211\'20\'13 such as the recent prosecution of private eyes ICU Investigations, who received fines of up to \u163\'00\'A37,000 \u8211\'20\'13 are dealt with in crown courts, which can impose unlimited monetary penalties. But jail sentences \u8211\'20\'13 which information commissioners have called for since 2006 \u8211\'20\'13 are not in the armoury.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt feels like it\u8217\'20\'19s groundhog day," says Mr Graham.\par \par \uc2 A provision for custodial sentences is included in the Criminal Justice and \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Act but has not been commenced into legislation because, as the commissioner says, it was \u8220\'20\'1Ccaught in the reeds of the Leveson Inquiry".\par \par \uc2 Some in Fleet Street appear hostile to the commissioner having more powers, but\u160\'00\'A0 Mr Graham accuses them of flawed thinking.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou can\u8217\'20\'19t have it both ways," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CYou can\u8217\'20\'19t say we don\u8217\'20\'19t do this sort of thing and by the way it would be a terrible attack on investigative journalism to commence\u160\'00\'A0 this legislation."\par \par \uc2 The ICO, which is based in Wilmslow, Cheshire, has not been immune to public-sector cuts and has seen its budget reduced from \u163\'00\'A35 million, when\u160\'00\'A0 Mr Graham arrived, to \u163\'00\'A33.75 million next year. He is exasperated by \u8220\'20\'1Crickety" funding mechanisms which mean he must keep separate spending pots for his two areas of responsibility: promoting freedom of information and maintaining data privacy. Both subjects are attracting growing numbers of complaints.\par \par \uc2 Mr Graham, who had a long career at the BBC as a radio and television journalist before becoming director general of the Advertising Standards Authority in 2000, would like a new data tax to create a single, ICO fund.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI would have thought\u160\'00\'A0 an information rights levy, paid for by public authorities and data controllers [is needed]. We would be fully accountable to Parliament for our spending."\par \par \uc2 Following Edward Snowden\u8217\'20\'19s revelations of GCHQ\u8217\'20\'19s mass collection of personal data (including phone calls, emails and use of social media), Mr Graham has written to Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chair of Parliament\u8217\'20\'19s Intelligence and Security Committee.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe have said there has got to be a democratic and accountable oversight regime for the security services\u8217\'20\'19 access to data; we have got to understand how it works," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s no longer convincing to have a senior Privy Councillor saying \u8216\'20\'18OK chaps, it\u8217\'20\'19s fine\u8217\'20\'19."\par \par \uc2 He says the public is more exercised by the \uc2 NHS\uc2  England care.data programme of a giant store of individual medical records than it is worried about Snowden.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople have been challenging me on the bus about care.data. That\u8217\'20\'19s the talking point but Snowden hasn\u8217\'20\'19t been, which is kind of a surprise."\par \par \uc2 He is critical of the \uc2 NHS\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s efforts to explain the care.data system, saying the ICO had advised individual letters to all patients.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey said \u8216\'20\'18No, we\u8217\'20\'19re going to do a leaflet.\u8217\'20\'19 I never received my leaflet," he says.\par \par \uc2 He has the right to compulsory audit of local government organisations which he criticises as \u8220\'20\'1Chopeless" in their handling of personal data.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt just happens far too often, that a social worker loses a memory stick, an unencrypted laptop is taken for home working and gets nicked after being left in the pub," he says.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140224ea2n000b6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NEWS\par \b \uc2 Two cities the size of Leeds needed to house new migrants; Prediction likely to put further pressure on David Cameron to deliver on pledge to reduce levels of net migration to tens of thousands\b0\par\par\uc2 By Steven Swinford Senior Political Correspondent   \par \uc2 558 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par 21:34\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Two cities the size of Leeds will be needed to accommodate a new generation of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  over the next decade, official figures indicate, amid fears that new arrivals are pushing up house prices.\par \par \uc2 An analysis by the independent House of Commons library has found that over the next decade, migrants will be responsible for 629,000 new households, equivalent to one in three formed in England.\par \par \uc2 The analysis will put further pressure on David Cameron to deliver on his pledge to reduce levels of net migration to \u8220\'20\'1Ctens of thousands" by the next election after restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian migrants were lifted.\par \par \uc2 Senior Conservative ministers including Theresa May, the Home Secretary, and Nick Boles, the planning minister, have raised concerns in the past that uncontrolled migration will push up house prices.\par \par \uc2 Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of MigrationWatch, said: \u8220\'20\'1CIt is entirely logical that mass migration will have an impact on house prices. If you get demand going up while supply remains stationary, house prices will rise.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe higher the prices, the more young people and first-time buyers are going to find it difficult to get their own place.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think the political classes haven\u8217\'20\'19t factored in the impact on housing. If you look at particular areas like London and the South East the pressure is even greater because so much migration takes place into those areas."\par \par \uc2 A total of 1.8\u8201\'20\'09million people have come to Britain since 2004, with net migration peaking at 250,000 in 2010. \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  are estimated to have formed the equivalent of 795,000 households, two thirds more than in the previous decade.\par \par \uc2 The House of Commons Library\par \par \uc2 forecasts that between 2011 and 2021 a further 1.4\u8201\'20\'09million migrants will come to Britain, forming the equivalent of 629,000 households. There are 320,000 households in Leeds.\par \par \uc2 James Clappison, the Conservative MP and member of the home affairs select committee who requested the research, said: \u8220\'20\'1CLabour pursued an open door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy and gave no thought to the consequences. The worry must be that a future Labour government will do that again."\par \par \uc2 Carlos Vargas-Silva, a senior researcher at \uc2 Oxford University\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Migration Observatory, said the arrival of new migrants could push up house prices.\par \par \uc2 He added that new migrants were likely to push up rental costs, and boost the buy-to-let market, meaning there would be fewer houses for sale.\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8220\'20\'1CMost migrants when they arrive in the country rent, and that is where the main impact is. Indirectly, this could have an effect on house prices because it encourages people to buy to let. Over the long term, if migrants stay then they are more likely to buy houses and potentially put pressure on the housing market.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe increase in the rents may displace British nationals. They may end up going into social housing because the price of rent is too high."\par \par \uc2 According to the figures, which are based on forecasts provided by the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2 , \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  will form 629,000 of the 2.2\u8201\'20\'09million new households between 2011 and 2021.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140224ea2n000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Downing Street believes that \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  will this week use a major summit in the UK to back \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s bid to renegotiate Britain\u8217\'20\'19s relationship with the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mrs Merkel will this week travel to the UK and become the first German Chancellor to address both Houses of Parliament.\par \par \uc2 Number 10 hopes that she will offer a boost to the Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s bid to reform the EU by calling for a treaty change that could allow Mr Cameron to change Britain\u8217\'20\'19s relationship with Brussels.\par \par \uc2 William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, said on Sunday that Germany is Britain\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cmost important partner" on seeking reform of the EU.\par \par \uc2 In a bid to cement the close ties between the two leaders, Mr Cameron has arranged for Mrs Merkel to address MPs and peers, followed by lunch in 10 Downing St and tea with the Queen at Buckingham Palace.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels and then give people a vote on membership by the end of 2017 if he wins the next election.\par \par \uc2 Any suggestion from Mrs Merkel that treaty change could happen before 2017 would represent a major boost for the Prime Minister.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Merkel has previously suggested that she is in favour of treaty change.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hague said that negotiations on Britain\u8217\'20\'19s relationship with the EU will not start until the 2015 election.\par \par \uc2 However, he said that Germany will be Britain\u8217\'20\'19s key partner in pushing for a more \u8220\'20\'1Cflexible, competitive and democratically accountable" union.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hague told the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  programme: \u8220\'20\'1CWe will be discussing the ideas that we have in common and, as you know, it's our intention after the next general election to improve Britain's relationship with the \uc2 European Union\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Asked whether the leaders will discuss reform of the rules that allow the free movement of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  within the EU, Mr Hague said: "I'm sure these subjects will come up. Germany also has strict benefit rules, Germany does not want its benefits system to be abused.\par \par \uc2 "We support the principle of the free movement of workers, and many British people have rightly taken advantage of that in the rest of Europe.\par \par \uc2 "But we don't support people moving from one country to another because of the incentives of different benefit systems.\par \par \uc2 "With Germany we have a lot of common ground on that and there will be no problem discussing that."\par \par \uc2 Last year Mr Cameron was invited by Mrs Merkel to the German Chancellor's private residence, a visit which was cited as a strengthening personal friendship.\par \par \uc2 The scale of the welcome for Mrs Merkel is in stark contrast to last month's Anglo-French summit with \uc2 Francois Hollande\uc2 , the French president.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron met Mr Hollande for a few hours at an airfield in Oxfordshire and then had a pub lunch.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140224ea2n000xt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A census report about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was amended when the Home Office complained that it looked too alarming, newly released e-mails disclose.\par \par \uc2 The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/index.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Office for National Statistics}}}\uc2  (ONS) changed the tone of its report about a huge rise in migration in the past decade after suggestions from Whitehall.\par \par \uc2 A leading academic research group said it was troubling that pressure had been put on the ONS to present data in a way that would receive a better response from the public.\par \par \uc2 The Home Office denied it had tried to minimise the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , and the ONS rejected any suggestion that it had toned down the statistics.\par \par \uc2 In a separate development, evangelical campaigners reacted with dismay to the disclosure that the ONS had demoted Christianity from the country\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cmain religion" to just its largest.\par \par \uc2 A rare glimpse behind the scenes of the Census was provided in the response to a Freedom of Information Act request made by The Times. The ONS was preparing to publish a paper last year based on migration statistics and sent a draft to the Home Office. The Census had found that half of all \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  had arrived in the previous decade. The newly released e-mails had been marked \u8220\'20\'1CRestricted".\par \par \uc2 Jon Simmons, head of migration and border analysis at the Home Office, wrote that the report \u8220\'20\'1Cfocuses on what could be seen as more alarming statistics, and could easily introduce more balance by adding in the alternatives . . . It\u8217\'20\'19s just a matter of tone really".\par \par \uc2 He noted that the passage \u8220\'20\'1Cstarts with country of birth \u8212\'20\'14 and obviously I think we should be giving more weight to foreign nationals than this does".\par \par \uc2 The issue of nationality versus birthplace is a sensitive part of the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate. Many people born overseas acquire British passports, so migration figures can be reduced if nationality is used to count \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  rather than country of origin.\par \par \uc2 Following the Home Office suggestion, the ONS inserted a passage stating that almost half of residents born outside the UK had British passports. The ONS promoted this on the front page of its bulletin as a \u8220\'20\'1Ckey figure".\par \par \uc2 Mr Simmons went on: \u8220\'20\'1CWhen it mentions \u8216\'20\'18half coming in the last ten years\u8217\'20\'19, why not also say half entered in previous decades?" The ONS declined to take this advice.\par \par \uc2 He also objected to a sentence highlighting that more European-born \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  had entered the UK in the past decade than in previous years combined, saying that \u8220\'20\'1Csome of those who had entered in earlier decades will have died".\par \par \uc2 Scott Blinder, director of the Migration Observatory at the \uc2 University of Oxford\uc2 , said: \u8220\'20\'1CIt is troubling to see any pressure on the ONS to manage public responses to data."\par \par \uc2 The Home Office said: \u8220\'20\'1CIt is completely untrue to suggest Home Office officials have attempted to influence the ONS in an improper way. Nor has any attempt been made to minimise the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  in independent statistical releases. The ONS are not experts in migration research and we work with them to provide additional insight on statistical issues."\par \par \uc2 The ONS said the Home Office had been calling for additional information, not alternative data. \u8220\'20\'1CAny amendments they suggest are agreed exclusively on the basis of sound statistical practice, free of any political influence," it said.\par \par \uc2 dkennedy@thetimes.co.uk\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140224ea2n000dy\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 On the run, the foreign killers and rapists that Britain can't throw out: 750 criminals simply disappear after being set free\b0\par\par\uc2 JACK DOYLE, HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT   \par \uc2 839 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2014\par 23:35\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

Other barriers can include difficulties in obtaining a passport for offenders who destroyed their travel documents on their arrival.\par \par \uc2 THE THUG WHOSE EX LIVES IN FEAR\par \par \uc2 Violent thug Kawa Ali Azad should have been deported five years ago.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the Iraqi failed asylum seeker is in Britain after twice going on the run while on bail granted by \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  judges.\par \par \uc2 He has six convictions for violence including an attack on the mother of his young son.\par \par \uc2 Azad, pictured, battered his terrified ex-partner Tania Doherty unconscious \u8211\'20\'13 before trying to snatch the boy.\par \par \uc2 In 2009, he was flown all the way to Baghdad, but the Iraqi authorities refused to take him and sent him back.\par \par \uc2 Miss Doherty says she and their son live in \u8216\'20\'18constant fear\u8217\'20\'19 that he will return.\par \par \uc2 They had to be moved and she was given a new identity in case Azad attacked them again.\par \par \uc2 She carries a phone with a direct link to police.\par \par \uc2 As a result, even the most dangerous offenders can be let out on bail by a judge.\par \par \uc2 Tory MP Nick de Bois said: \u8216\'20\'18It is deeply worrying that so many dangerous foreign criminals are walking the streets and urgent action must be taken to find them.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18The British public are losing patience with so-called human rights claims putting them at risk. These criminals should by rights have been thrown out of this country and put back in jail in their country of origin.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The new scandal is the latest blow to the reputation of the beleaguered \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  service, and is a serious blow to David Cameron, who has made personal pledges to deport more foreign offenders.\par \par \uc2 The freedom of information request was made in March last year, but despite a legal requirement to release the information after 21 days, no response was received until last month.\par \par \uc2 The Home Office refused to say which countries the offenders are from. It claimed releasing that information could undermine its ability to negotiate deportation agreements with foreign governments.\par \par \uc2 Officials also refused to say exactly how many criminals had committed particular offences \u8211\'20\'13 if the total was fewer than five \u8211\'20\'13 in case it could aid public identification.\par \par \uc2 But they said there were fewer than five criminals guilty of manslaughter, and at least one guilty of conspiracy to murder.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 They admitted they did not classify the criminals according to how much of a risk they pose to the public.\par \par \uc2 A Home Office spokesman said: \u8216\'20\'18We believe foreign nationals who break our rules should be removed from the UK at the earliest opportunity.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Last year we removed more than 4,500 foreign national offenders. Where individuals abscond from our controls, we work closely with the police and probation services and employ specialist trace teams to return these individuals to prison.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Absconders are circulated on the Police National Computer and are added to our watch lists in case those who have left the country seek to re-enter.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140224ea2n001ei\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Foreign secretary emphasises role of German chancellor to UK relationship with \uc2 European Union\uc2  prior to her London visit\par \par \uc2 William Hague has suggested that \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  is sympathetic to the UK's efforts at reforming the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , ahead of the German chancellor's visit to London later this week to discuss overhauling \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rules.\par \par \uc2 Hague said Merkel understands \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's position and is the most important partner in seeking a new relationship between EU member states.\par \par \uc2 Cameron appears to be making a special effort for Merkel, who makes a whirlwind trip to London on Thursday, as Downing Street believes she could use the trip to publicly back his efforts to bring about treaty changes.\par \par \uc2 During the visit Merkel will have tea with the Queen and become the first German chancellor to address both houses of parliament.\par \par \uc2 Hague said serious renegotiations about the UK's relationship with Brussels will not start until after the next election, but the talks with Merkel will mark the start of finding "common ground" for changes. Asked about overhauling freedom of movement rules, a key demand of the UK, Hague said: "I'm sure these subjects will come up. Germany also has strict benefit rules. Germany doesn't want its benefit system to be abused. I think again with Germany we have a lot of common ground on that."\par \par \uc2 Lord Heseltine, a former Tory deputy prime minister, separately warned the government against giving too much credence to Ukip, which he called the UK Isolationist Party and compared to the Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament protest movement in the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 "When the great argument comes about Europe and suddenly people realise that Ukip is saying: We're going to opt-out, we're going to pack it in, we're going to leave the Europe that now exists \u8211\'20\'13 27 countries dominated increasingly by Germany and we're going to sit on our bottoms on an island offshore and think the world is going to say "Oh whoopee \u8230\'20\'26 good old Britain they're independent and free"'. The fact is we would just be an offshore island, Americans would immediately start switching their priorities towards Europe, inward investment would start changing its emphasis towards Europe."\par \par \uc2 He also said it was a bad idea for Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, to have given Ukip credibility as a party by agreeing to debate with Nigel Farage, the Eurosceptic party's leader.\par \par \uc2 Amid strong Euroscepticism on his backbenches and growing support for Ukip, the prime minister has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels and then give people a vote on membership by the end of 2017 if he is still in power. However, he needs European allies to support his drive for reform.\par \par \uc2 The key issue for Cameron will be whether he can force concessions on the EU's fundamental principle of freedom of movement, which he says have caused vast movements of people from poorer to richer countries.\par \par \uc2 However, \uc2 Jose Manuel Barroso\uc2 , the European commission president, last week poured cold water on Cameron's desire to reform freedom of movement.\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140223ea2o000ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Eighty years ago, in the depths of the 1930s economic depression, Ronald Kidd, a journalist, found himself in the middle of Trafalgar Square witnessing bloody clashes between thousands of police and newly arrived hunger marchers and their supporters.\par \par \uc2 He was angered by the actions of police agent provocateurs who, dressed as ordinary workmen, attempted to incite violence among the peaceful protestors. Seventy-five protesters were badly injured that day in October 1932 when the largest of a series of hunger marches reached London.\par \par \uc2 Kidd was so shocked by what he saw that he went on to become a founding figure of what is Britain's oldest human rights campaign and is now known as Liberty. He was to be the first general secretary of the Council for Civil Liberties, the cross-party organisation founded to protect civil liberties and promote human rights. Its birth was announced 80 years ago today in a letter to the Manchester Guardian published on 24 February 1934.\par \par \uc2 The signatories raised fears that a similar bloody reception was being prepared by the Metropolitan police for the next national hunger march to arrive in the capital. The letter was signed by HG Wells, Vera Brittain, Dr Edith Summerskill, Clement Atlee, Professor Harold Laski and a further nine of the most prominent supporters of the Council for Civil Liberties. They promised to "maintain a vigilant observation" of the treatment of the hunger marchers by acting as responsible and neutral legal observers.\par \par \uc2 Kidd's friend EM Forster, along with AP Herbert and HG Wells, joined him and his partner, Sylvia Scaffardi, who were at that second march watching out for police agent provocateurs.\par \par \uc2 A letter marking that 80th anniversary is published by the Guardian today, signed by Liberty's director, Shami Chakrabarti, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, Doreen Lawrence, the actor Vanessa Redgrave, the former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell MP, the children's laureate, Malorie Blackman, the human rights lawyer Gareth Peirce and the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, among others.\par \par \uc2 The letter also highlights Kidd's role, in October 1932 when he was among the 100,000-strong crowd who had greeted the hunger marchers with their petition to parliament, which had 1m signatures. Thousands of police had been mobilised and the march was blocked from reaching Westminster with the worst violence breaking out around Trafalgar Square, where Kidd witnessed the bloodshed first-hand.\par \par \uc2 Before the next planned hunger march in February 1934, he was determined to gather support across the political spectrum, from lawyers, artists and scientists, to raise the alarm over the threat to peaceful protest.\par \par \uc2 On 22 February 1934, the Council for Civil Liberties was formed at a meeting in the crypt of St Martin-in-the-Fields church on Trafalgar Square, where an 80th anniversary exhibition is being held.\par \par \uc2 Those attending vowed to defend not just peaceful protest but also the "whole spirit of British freedom". Forster was the first president, and other early supporters included AA Milne, who was a vice-president, George Bernard Shaw, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and JB Priestley.\par \par \uc2 The letter to the Manchester Guardian, published two days after the founding meeting, noted the attorney-general had hinted at the possibility of bloodshed when the hunger marchers arrived, and said that some of the preparations, including instructing shopkeepers to barricade their windows, could not but create an unjustified and dangerous atmosphere of misgiving.\par \par \uc2 "In view of the general and alarming tendency to encroachment on the liberty of the citizen, there has recently been formed a Council for Civil Liberties," they announced in their letter. "Relevant and well-authenticated reports by responsible persons will be welcomed and investigated by the council," the letter promised.\par \par \uc2 Thousands of protesters gathered in Hyde Park when the 1934 hunger march arrived in London amid a heavy police presence. The new observers confirmed the presence once again of police agent provocateurs.\par \par \uc2 But the official predictions of bloodshed were proved wrong and the rally passed off peacefully. Kidd's initiative ensured that a permanent body of observers was established.\par \par \uc2 On Kidd's death in 1942, Forster wrote a tribute to him which is carved on a plaque that still hangs in Liberty's offices: "Passionate in his hatred of injustice, wise in judgment, fearless in action, he championed the liberties of the people in the fight that is never done," it reads.\par \par \uc2 Chakrabarti said: "Our founders could hardly have envisaged that, 80 years on, Liberty would be needed more than ever with blanket surveillance, toxic \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policies and direct attacks on the very idea of human rights and the rule of law. We owe it as much to previous generations as to those yet to come to keep up 'the fight that is never done'."\par \par \uc2 Letters, page 27\u8594\'21\'92\par \par \uc2 HG Wells was among prominent figures who joined Ronald Kidd in setting up the Council for Civil Liberties in 1934\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Police arrest hunger marchers in London in 1932.

\par\par \uc2 NATIONAL NEWS\par \b \uc2 Review to unveil 'visas for auction' proposal\b0\par\par\uc2 By Helen Warrell, Public Policy Correspondent   \par \uc2 482 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 February 2014\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFTA\par \uc2 London Ed3\par 06\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Proposals due to be unveiled this week would allow UK visas to be auctioned off to the highest bidders, despite criticism from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  lawyers that this would create an "\uc2 eBay\uc2  culture" for permanent residence in Britain.\par \par \uc2 Under current rules, overseas investors can pay \u163\'00\'A31m, \u163\'00\'A35m or \u163\'00\'A310m to speed up the grant of the right to live permanently in Britain.\par \par \uc2 Depending on the amount paid, the process takes from two to five years. Applicants who cannot afford investor visas must comply with strict requirements depending on what job they are seeking, how much they will be paid, or whether they have a family member who can support them.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 the Migration Advisory Committee\uc2  has been scrutinising these arrangements following Home Office concerns that the investments - usually made in Gilts, or as a loan to the applicant's own business - are not sufficiently beneficial to the UK economy .\par \par \uc2 Sir David Metcalf, who chairs the committee, will publish options tomorrow, such as auctioning off a set number of visas each year or recasting the million-pound investments as "end-o-w-ments" to universities.\par \par \uc2 The auction proposal is understood to have met significant scepticism from within the Home Office and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.\par \par \uc2 The idea comes at a sensitive time, given that Maltese proposals to sell off passports for \u8364\'20\'AC650,000 each were slammed by EU members concerned the scheme would turn citizenship into a "tradeable commodity" .\par \par \uc2 The number of UK investor visas rose from 423 in 2011-12 to 530 in 2012-13, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The majority went to Chinese, with Russians and Americans not far behind.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  lawyers representing wealthy foreign clients have universally criticised the auction proposal. Nick Rollason, head of business \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at Kingsley Napley, warned that this would create an "\uc2 eBay\uc2  culture" for handing out visas. "It will also leave a bad taste in the mouths of the British public," he said.\par \par \uc2 Julia Onslow-Cole, head of global \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at PwC Legal, says the current system of a set investment threshold, maintained for the duration of the visa, was more beneficial to the economy than a one-off payment. "Selling visas to the highest bidder, thereby treating them as a commodity, does not guarantee that they will continue to invest in the UK," she said.\par \par \uc2 Kamal Rahman, head of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at \uc2 Mishcon de Reya\uc2 , a law firm, said the important thing was to find an efficient way of channelling money to boost growth.\par \par \uc2 "Philosophically, the idea of directing investors into areas of public services where finance is most needed is not controversial, but the system has got to be clear and simple for clients and there is also the question of who would manage and monitor any new fund," Ms Rahman said.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140224ea2o0001z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 'The \uc2 NHS\uc2  database is the talking point - not Snowden'\b0\par\par\uc2 IAN BURRELL   \par \uc2 1,152 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 February 2014\par \uc2 The Independent\par \uc2 IND\par \uc2 1ST\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News | Dealing with matters from blue-chip blagging to spam, Christopher Graham is at the heart of one of the most urgent issues of the day - privacy. The Information Commissioner talks to IAN BURRELL\par \par \uc2 For a guardian of the nation's privacy, Christopher Graham is having to grow used to incursions into his own personal space as the public confront him on buses and in hotel lobbies with concerns over the safety of their intimate details.\par \par \uc2 The Information Commissioner didn't expect this level of recognition when he took the job in 2009 but his tenure in what had been a relatively low-key post has coincided with a data revolution.\par \par \uc2 Mr Graham, 63, has found himself interviewed on television about lost medical records, and summoned to the Leveson Inquiry to answer questions about private investigators "blagging" secrets from banks and phone companies. His office has been front-page news after The Independent's revelations that blue-chip companies are accused of illegally obtaining the public's private information.\par \par \uc2 "It's top of people's agenda - both citizens and politicians and businesses. Everyone wants to know what the Information Commissioner is going to do," he says. Clearly he has enjoyed the experience, because last week it was quietly confirmed that he has signed up for a further two years in the role.\par \par \uc2 But that doesn't mean he thinks he has the tools to do what is an increasingly demanding job. He has "pretty limited powers" and is frustrated that some of his office's recent prosecutions have been thrown out.\par \par \uc2 "I had one of our fines struck down the other day because I couldn't prove that dumping all the pensions records in the recycling area of the local supermarket was going to cause serious damage or distress," he complains, of an attempted prosecution of Scottish Borders council. "I couldn't prove that someone of malicious intent had picked up all this personal information and was going to be doing people down."\par \par \uc2 The information tribunal also rejected his office's attempts to prosecute Tetrus Telecoms for sending thousands of spam text messages because the judge didn't accept that substantial damage and distress had been caused.\par \par \uc2 "We could show there was nuisance - that isn't enough apparently," the commissioner says. "We have just got to lower that hurdle because I think if you ask most people they would say silent calls and unsolicited spam texts are one of the great curses of the age - and if the Information Commissioner can't protect you it's a poor lookout."\par \par \uc2 Under data-protection laws, the \uc2 Information Commissioner's Office\uc2  (ICO) can bring only monetary penalties. Even the criminal offence of unauthorised disclosure or obtaining of personal information (Section 55 of the Data Protection Act) carries only a fine and is often dealt with by a magistrate.\par \par \uc2 "The track record in the magistrates' court is pretty pathetic," Mr Graham says. If people don't think this sort of thing matters and if you get to the magistrates' court you will be fined about \u163\'00\'A3120; not surprisingly the public doesn't have great confidence that their personal information will stay secure."\par \par \uc2 This lack of confidence, he says, has huge implications for the Government's plans to improve public-sector efficiency by moving services online.\par \par \uc2 "If you don't have confidence in the way data controllers will handle all the information they are bound to hold on us these days because we are doing everything online then - surprise, surprise - you don't have the public confidence for the big data-sharing initiatives that the Government wants to see in the public service."\par \par \uc2 More serious cases of information theft - such as the recent prosecution of private eyes ICU Investigations, who received fines of up to \u163\'00\'A37,000 - are dealt with in crown courts, which can impose unlimited monetary penalties. But jail sentences - which information commissioners have called for since 2006 - are not in the armoury.\par \par \uc2 "It feels like it's Groundhog Day," Mr Graham says.\par \par \uc2 A provision for custodial sentences is included in the Criminal Justice and \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Act but has not been commenced into legislation because, as the commissioner says, it was "caught in the reeds of the Leveson Inquiry".\par \par \uc2 Some in Fleet Street appear hostile to the commissioner having more powers, but Mr Graham accuses them of flawed thinking.\par \par \uc2 "You can't have it both ways," he says. "You can't say we don't do this sort of thing and by the way it would be a terrible attack on investigative journalism to commence this legislation."\par \par \uc2 The ICO, which is based in Wilmslow, Cheshire, has not been immune to public-sector cuts and has seen its budget reduced from \u163\'00\'A35m, when Mr Graham arrived, to \u163\'00\'A33.75m next year. He is exasperated by "rickety" funding mechanisms which mean he must keep separate spending pots for his two areas of responsibility: promoting freedom of information and maintaining data privacy. Both subjects are attracting growing numbers of complaints.\par \par \uc2 Mr Graham, who had a long career at the BBC as a radio and television journalist before becoming director-general of the Advertising Standards Authority in 2000, would like a new data tax to create a single, ICO fund.\par \par \uc2 "I would have thought an information-rights levy, paid for by public authorities and data controllers [is needed]. We would be fully accountable to Parliament for our spending."\par \par \uc2 Following Edward Snowden's revelations of GCHQ's mass collection of personal data (including phone calls, emails and use of social media), Mr Graham has written to Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chair of Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee.\par \par \uc2 "We have said there has got to be a democratic and accountable oversight regime for the security services' access to data; we have got to understand how it works," he says. "It's no longer convincing to have a senior Privy Councillor saying, 'OK chaps, it's fine.'"\par \par \uc2 He says the public is more exercised by the \uc2 NHS\uc2  England care.data programme of a giant store of individual medical records than it is worried about Mr Snowden.\par \par \uc2 "People have been challenging me on the bus about care.data. That's the talking point but Snowden hasn't been, which is kind of a surprise."\par \par \uc2 He is critical of the \uc2 NHS\uc2 's efforts to explain the care.data system, saying the ICO had advised individual letters to all patients.\par \par \uc2 "They said 'No, we're going to do a leaflet.' I never received my leaflet," he says.\par \par \uc2 He has the right to compulsory audit of local government organisations which he criticises as "hopeless" in their handling of personal data.\par \par \uc2 "It just happens far too often, that a social worker loses a memory stick, an unencrypted laptop is taken for home working and gets nicked after being left in the pub," he says.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140224ea2o0001d\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 TALKS & POETRY\b0\par\par\uc2 140 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 February 2014\par \uc2 i\par \uc2 IIND\par \uc2 1ST\par 46,47\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd.

\par\par \uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 May risks new row with No 10 over increase in visa costs\b0\par\par\uc2 Francis Elliott, Richard Ford   \par \uc2 572 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 February 2014\par 00:01\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Theresa May is seeking to increase visa fees dramatically to help to plug a \u163\'00\'A350 million hole in the Home Office budget.\par \par \uc2 The plan, revealed in leaked documents, risks provoking a fresh row with No 10, which has made boosting student and business visits to Britain a priority. It will also be seen as a shot across the bows of George Osborne, who is being privately warned by fellow Cabinet ministers not to raid departments\u8217\'20\'19 spending in the Budget next month.\par \par \uc2 The proposal for an across-the-board rise in visa fees is contained in a letter from a Home Office official circulated around Whitehall and seen by The Times.It reveals that the department is facing a \u163\'00\'A350 million shortfall and says that increasing visa fees by 4 per cent \u8212\'20\'14 more than double the rate of inflation \u8212\'20\'14 is among the least worst options.\par \par \uc2 At present, an overseas student applying for a six-month visa to the UK pays at least \u163\'00\'A380. The rise will anger businesses, tourist attractions and universities who depend on attracting foreign experts, clients, visitors and students.\par \par \uc2 The Home Office was among Whitehall departments to have its budget \u8220\'20\'1Ctop-sliced" by the Chancellor last autumn as part of the spending squeeze.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  forced Mrs May to scrap plans to impose bonds of up to \u163\'00\'A33,000 on visitors deemed to pose a high risk of overstaying their visas. It had caused an outcry in countries such as India, putting at risk Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s efforts to boost British exports.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister has announced premium fast-track visa services for elite travellers from China, India and the Gulf states as part of his trade drive. The Home Secretary\u8217\'20\'19s decision to raise visa fees will be seen by some as an act of revenge. It follows an on-going clash between Mr Cameron and Mrs May over curbs to the stop and search powers. The Prime Minister has vetoed proposals developed by Mrs May dramatically to reduce the police power that is blamed for straining community relations.\par \par \uc2 Mrs May is also facing a backlash from police commissioners, who say that she is making \u8220\'20\'1Cstealth cuts" to frontline policing.\par \par \uc2 They say that the Home Secretary has undermined them by raiding their budgets to finance central government initiatives.\par \par \uc2 The \u8220\'20\'1Ctop slicing" of the \u163\'00\'A34.4 billion Home Office main grant to forces was announced before Christmas, with ministers claiming that the police budget was \u8220\'20\'1Cprotected from further reductions".\par \par \uc2 However, the detail of the statement revealed that more than \u163\'00\'A377 million had been diverted from the 43 forces in England and Wales to Whitehall.\par \par \uc2 A \u163\'00\'A350 million Police Innovation Fund \u8212\'20\'14 to which commissioners can apply to pay for collaboration projects to improve efficiency\u8212\'20\'14 is being set up. The \uc2 Independent Police Complaints Commission\uc2  is to get an extra \u163\'00\'A318 million, and \uc2 HM Inspectorate of Constabulary\uc2  will receive \u163\'00\'A39.4 million to inspect every force annually.\par \par \uc2 A Home Office spokeswoman said: \u8220\'20\'1CVisa fees are increasing because we are reducing the cost of the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system to the taxpayer. \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  and visitors should contribute their fair share to the system." She added that it was untrue that the department was facing a funding shortfall. \u8220\'20\'1CThe Home Office \u8212\'20\'14 like the Government overall \u8212\'20\'14 is performing well in cutting spending while protecting and improving services."\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140224ea2o000pf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 UK News\par \b \uc2 The Times Diary (TMS): Paxo stirring in the valleys, Drenge, honours and bloopers\b0\par\par\uc2 592 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 February 2014\par 00:01\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Poor Huw Edwards. Not only has the BBC news anchor been denied the chance to run election night, with David Dimbleby to front his ninth general election in 2015. (Many suspect he\u8217\'20\'19ll keep going until Plaid Cymru get in.) Now he gets a sock in the eye from \uc2 Jeremy Paxman\uc2 , who wrote in a weekend book review that Edwards \u8220\'20\'1Ccan come across like some evangelical preacher on a wet Sunday morning in Merthyr Tydfil".\par \par \uc2 Paxman is entertainingly grouchy all round in his review of Andrew Pettegree\u8217\'20\'19s The Invention of News, slamming \u8220\'20\'1Creporters in rehab" who pose as professors of media studies, complaining that most books on the media are \u8220\'20\'1Cnotably unreadable" and even turning the fire on his own show. \u8220\'20\'1CIn one of Newsnight\u8217\'20\'19s more troubled phases, we used to joke that our slogan ought to be \u8216\'20\'18If it\u8217\'20\'19s news, it\u8217\'20\'19s news to us\u8217\'20\'19." Perhaps he\u8217\'20\'19s just missing his beard?\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 NHS\uc2  is seeking an interim senior communications manager for one of its London agencies. The advert says they want someone to \u8220\'20\'1Cboost the external prescience of the organisation". Surely foresight is what all press offices need.\par \par \uc2 Drenge on the playlist\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband may not have heeded the advice given last year by Tom Watson in the former election co-ordinator\u8217\'20\'19s resignation letter to listen to a rock group called Drenge \u8212\'20\'14 they didn\u8217\'20\'19t appear on his Desert Island Discs \u8212\'20\'14 but someone in Government did. Drenge have just been awarded a grant of up to \u163\'00\'A350,000 by \uc2 UK Trade & Investment\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Music Export Growth Scheme to promote their music overseas. It seems appropriate that a socialist MP should like a group that is subsidised by the taxpayer.\par \par \uc2 One of TMS\u8217\'20\'19s bewigged readers was doing his barristering at Leicester Crown Court last week, where a man was acquitted of various sexual offences. At one point, the jury heard evidence of the unorthodox use of a bicycle pump at which the defendant\u8217\'20\'19s elderly grandmother was heard to say in confusion: \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t understand this. He doesn\u8217\'20\'19t own a bicycle."\par \par \uc2 Question of honours\par \par \uc2 Dominic Raab, the Tory MP, annoyed Downing Street recently by leading a rebellion over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Now he is asking questions about honours. Any hope that this would embarrass Tony Blair, with all those gongs for dinner ladies, vanished when the answer came back that, apart from in 2000, more honours have been handed out in each of the past two years than any other since 1995.\par \par \uc2 The number has increased by a third since 2005, with more than 2,400 honours awarded last year. So far in 2014, 1,202 people have had one. There will be a national shortage of ribbon at this rate, but it remains some way shy of Lloyd George\u8217\'20\'19s record of 25,000 OBEs and 1,500 knighthoods in six years.\par \par \uc2 Toe-curling bloopers\par \par \uc2 Now the Winter Olympics are over we can forget about curling for four years. The BBC\u8217\'20\'19s voice-recognition software never knew it existed. In the men\u8217\'20\'19s final the subtitles declared that Britain was \u8220\'20\'1Cgoing for a gold in the killing". Just as well they only got silver.\par \par \uc2 Ian Moorcroft e-mailed in another curling blooper last week, when an effort by Britain in the semi-final was described as \u8220\'20\'1Ca great recovery frock". For the life of me, I have no idea what was actually said. Maybe it was a fashion statement.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140224ea2o000q5\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 WHAT THE OTHER PAPERS SAY THIS MORNING\b0\par\par\uc2 547 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 February 2014\par \uc2 City AM\par \uc2 CITYMO\par \uc2 1; National\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014. CITY AM.   \par \par \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  plans to cut US assets \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  has for the first time laid out its plans to slash its US balance sheet as it seeks to allay concerns over how it would deal with tough new rules imposed by the Federal Reserve on foreign banks. The lender aims to reduce assets held in its US arm by up to a quarter largely through reassigning some operations to Europe or in Asia. This comes after the Fed confirmed last week that overseas lenders operating in the US would have to ringfence capital in the country to safeguard against future financial crises.\par \par \uc2 BP Iraqi oilfield in jeopardy The future of BP's flagship Rumaila oilfield in southern Iraq is in jeopardy after a bureaucratic snarl-up in Baghdad forced the company to axe a hundred crucial contractor jobs. The move highlights the mounting challenges facing western oil majors in Iraq, and bodes ill for the country's ambitious plans to revive an oil industry still recovering from years of war and sanctions.\par \par \uc2 UK migration in visa auctions plan Proposals due to be unveiled this week would allow UK visas to be auctioned off to the highest bidders, despite criticism from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  lawyers that this would create an "\uc2 eBay\uc2  culture" for permanent residence in Britain. Under current rules, overseas investors can pay \u163\'00\'A31m, \u163\'00\'A35m or \u163\'00\'A310m to speed up the process.\par \par \uc2 Secret pension fees to be exposed Pension companies will be made to come clean about the web of hidden costs draining billions of pounds from Britain's retirement pots.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 In 1900 the Labour Party was created to ensure a fair deal for workers.\par \par \uc2 But modern Labour has moved away from them \u8212\'20\'14 to representing benefit claimants.\par \par \uc2 If you don\u8217\'20\'19t want to work but live on benefits, if you believe working people should pay your welfare bills through their taxes, then Labour is for you, giving you that safety net but never a ladder to replace dependency with aspiration.\par \par \uc2 Party leader Ed Miliband thinks the \u163\'00\'A3117billion a year that taxpayers pay on welfare benefits is too little.\par \par \uc2 So who is ready to stand up and say to working people, on average earnings of \u163\'00\'A327,000, that the \u163\'00\'A31,120 you pay every year out of your taxes to pay the \u8220\'20\'1Cwages" of benefit claimants \u8212\'20\'14 not even including the state pension \u8212\'20\'14 is high enough and should be reduced?\par \par \uc2 Who is really going to speak up for those families across Britain where one partner goes out to work at 6am in their van and comes back home at 7pm, when the other partner goes out to work?\par \par \uc2 The kind of families that rarely have a holiday, struggle to keep their heads above water but have a work ethic second to none.\par \par \uc2 They would rather work than live off the earnings of other hard-pressed taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 If Labour, with their credo of high benefits and high taxation, has abandoned workers, who can step in to fill the gap?\par \par \uc2 Not the Liberal Democrats, who represent the chattering classes with their pro EU, pro high green taxes agenda.\par \par \uc2 Nor UKIP, who are angry that Britain has moved on from the 1950s without their permission and seem to think that bashing \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , or getting lawful Muslims to sign special papers, will get working people on side.\par \par \uc2 Might it be the Conservatives, the party of Disraeli, who made it their mission to \u8220\'20\'1Celevate the condition of working people"? Or of Thatcher, who introduced the right to buy?\par \par \uc2 Possibly, but years of neglect have meant that the Conservatives have been decimated in Scotland and weakened in the north of England while, for all sorts of historical and political reasons, many millions of ethnic minority voters are still suspicious of the party.\par \par \uc2 Can the Conservatives reclaim the mantle as the party for hard-working people?\par \par \uc2 So far they have cut taxes for 20million lower earners, created 1.6million jobs and 1.5million apprenticeships, capped benefits and frozen fuel duty.\par \par \uc2 But to win back support, radical change is needed in the very nature of the Conservative Party.\par \par \uc2 Let\u8217\'20\'19s stop bashing trade unions and make clearer the distinction between their militant leaders and hard-working members.\par \par \uc2 Let\u8217\'20\'19s offer Conservative-minded trade unionists free membership of the party.\par \par \uc2 Let\u8217\'20\'19s value public sector workers \u8212\'20\'14 nurses, doctors, police and teachers \u8212\'20\'14 millions of whom put service above self.\par \par \uc2 Let\u8217\'20\'19s support working people by strengthening the minimum wage and fight for a living wage \u8212\'20\'14 achieved through further tax cuts for lower earners.\par \par \uc2 Let\u8217\'20\'19s also transform the Conservative Party, so never again will it be allowed to be called the party for the rich.\par \par \uc2 First, rename it the Workers\u8217\'20\'19 Party, the party that speaks for the aspiration of hard-working people and has the policies that count to help them.\par \par \uc2 Second, replace the party\u8217\'20\'19s tree emblem with a symbol of a ladder \u8212\'20\'14 representing the moral mission that has always provided the foundation of Conservative values.\par \par \uc2 Third, let\u8217\'20\'19s give working people a real reason to join the new Workers\u8217\'20\'19 Party \u8212\'20\'14 with a joining fee of just \u163\'00\'A31 it could be more of a trade union than a political party.\par \par \uc2 Not a trade union of the Bob Crow variety but one that offers real services to its members.\par \par \uc2 So a discount fuel card offering cheaper petrol, and other retail offerings that help with the cost of living.\par \par \uc2 Instead of asking members for money, the new Workers\u8217\'20\'19 Party would be offering services to members.\par \par \uc2 None of this is rocket science but there is a huge opportunity here.\par \par \uc2 Back the workers, forgotten by Labour, and the Conservatives might even return to power \u8212\'20\'14 and this time with a good majority.\par \par \uc2 - I ONCE met a man who told me the Government wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t let him go to the zoo.

Should more taxes be paid so he could go to the zoo?\par \par \uc2 His response was illuminating: \u8220\'20\'1CIt is my human right to go to the zoo."

This figure had been rising inexorably and unaffordably."\par \par \uc2 Benyon has also previously attacked the Labour Party over welfare payments and said: "Labour want benefits to go up more than the earnings of people in work.\par \par \uc2 "This isn't fair and we will not let them bring back their something for nothing culture."\par \par \uc2 Eileen Short, of Defend Council Housing, said last night: "How dare Richard Benyon lecture us about 'something for nothing' when he and others like him are living off the poorest and milking taxpayers all the way to the bank? "It's not tenants who gain from housing benefit, but some of the richest people in Britain. They get richer at our expense - and blame us while they're at it."\par \par \uc2 Our investigation comes after it emerged UKIP's housing spokesman Andrew Charalambous was making a fortune off migrant tenants on benefits - despite party leader Nigel Farage calling for a ban on foreigners claiming welfare.\par \par \uc2 The loaded landlord has pocketed \u163\'00\'A3745,351 in housing benefit from occupants, who he admits include \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Married dad-of-five Benyon is a director of the Englefield Estate Trust Corporation Limited, who own most of the land and property linked to his family.\par \par \uc2 Their farms have also received more than \u163\'00\'A32million in EU subsidies since 2000.\par \par \uc2 The public school educated MP for Newbury comes from a long line of Tory politicians. Dad Sir William Benyon was an MP for more than 20 years and his greatgreat-grandad was PM Lord Salisbury. Benyon is one of a string of Tories and their donors who pocketed large sums in housing benefit last year.\par \par \uc2 Tory donor Sir Richard Sutton's Settled Estates Ltd received \u163\'00\'A367,521 in from \uc2 West Berkshire Council\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Sir Richard, 76, inherited a \u163\'00\'A3150million fortune and is estimated to be the 522nd wealthiest person in Britain.\par \par \uc2 Tory peer Lord Cavendish, 72, benefited from \u163\'00\'A3106,938 in housing benefit last year from Barrow Council in Cumbria through his shareholding in Holker Estates.\par \par \uc2 And the estate of one of Britain's richest men, the billionaire Earl of Cadogan, 76, a Tory donor, received \u163\'00\'A3116,400 in benefit from Kensington and Chelsea Council.\par \par \uc2 Eileen Short added: "It's time we stopped greedy private landlords living off housing benefit. Instead of subsidising landlords, we ought to cut rents, not benefits, and invest the money in council housing that's secure and really affordable.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg should never have challenged UKIP leader Nigel Farage to a debate, Lord Heseltine has said.\par \par \uc2 The former Deputy Prime Minister dismissed the party as a "protest group" and said Mr Clegg should not entertain it.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg invited Mr Farage last week to a debate over Britain's membership of the EU. "I wouldn't do it if I was him [Mr Clegg]," said Lord Heseltine. "I think that it's a misjudgment, frankly, to equate the leadership of a party which is part of Government with a protest group ... more about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  than it is about Europe."\par \par \uc2 Speaking on Sky News' Murnaghan programme, he dismissed UKIP as "isolationist". The Tory peer likened it to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 He said: "CND was seen as an allconquering protest group. They had one of the biggest demonstrations in London of all time ... and that was in early 1983.\par \par \uc2 "A few months later in the general election of '83, the existence of CND and the damning relationship of that with the Labour Party enabled us to have a massive victory.\par \par \uc2 "We have never been isolated from Europe, our politics have always been absolutely interwoven with Europe."\par \par \uc2 His comments came as \uc2 Simon Hughes\uc2 , former deputy leader of the Lib Dems, admitted that Mr Clegg would have his work cut out in the debate, set to take place next month.\par \par \uc2 He said: "It will be a tough gig, and he knows that, and Nigel is a difficult opponent, but Nick has never been afraid."\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage's attempts to broaden support for UKIP have received a boost with a donation from Sir Tim Rice, the lyricist behind of West End hits Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar, who is understood to have given \u163\'00\'A37,500.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140224ea2o0001g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

While Germany are obviously tough opposition the likes of Ireland, Poland, Georgia and Gibraltar should hold no fears for Gordon Strachan's resurgent side.\par \par \uc2 And with Darren Fletcher back, pictured, and Dundee United's world-class talents on the verge of getting into the national set-up, I think Scotland have every chance.\par \par \uc2 That wee Ryan Gauld would wipe the floor with Mesut Ozil.\par \par \uc2 MIKE SIMPSON By email\par \par \uc2 IT would be intersesting going to an away game in Gibraltar under an independent Scotland.\par \par \uc2 We might not have the Pound (even though it does actually part-belong to Scotland, it's not solely England's) \u8212\'20\'14 yet some wee island in the middle of the Mediterranean is allowed to use Sterling?\par \par \uc2 What do you say to that David Cameron? Probably not very much.\par \par \uc2 JEN BROWN Dundee\par \par \uc2 CAN'T wait for the Tartan Army trips for the Euro 2016 qualifiers.\par \par \uc2 With the exception of Gibralatar, it should be a right good swally fest.\par \par \uc2 Oh, and the football should be all right, as well.\par \par \uc2 Come on Strachan and his boys. You can do it.\par \par \uc2 RICKY THOMSON Glasgow\par \par \uc2 I THINK it is good that we have debates on sensitive issues, but I fail to see the point when it is so loaded on one side or the other.\par \par \uc2 There was no balance to Channel 5's The Big British \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Row.\par \par \uc2 I am no fan of that Katie Hopkins, but at least she tried to put the other side of the story.\par \par \uc2 DAVE WALSH Motherwell\par \par \uc2 ANY sort of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate should have been held on Sky or the BBC.\par \par \uc2 Channel 5 are only interested in outrage and scaremongering. It was a pointless exercise.\par \par \uc2 IAN MUIR Aberdeen\par \par \uc2 THE only thing that was achieved by the show was an increase in the feelings between people living here and the flood of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 KEVIN WALKER Dundee\par \par \uc2 KATIE HOPKINS may not be everyone's favourite person, but she was badly outnumbered in a "debate" that was always going to be try to make her look bad. But she stuck to her guns.\par \par \uc2 MICHAEL HUNT Cumbernauld\par \par \uc2 I WAS totally disgusted that the TV debate featuring Katie Hopkins was so one-sided.\par \par \uc2 The vast majority of the audience were of foreign origin. Katie was the only panellist who stuck up for the majority of British people.\par \par \uc2 LES KOZAK By email\par \par \uc2 WHAT a sterling job Katie Hopkins, pictured, did on the TV debate shown last week.\par \par \uc2 The show was a farce. It was badly presented and poorly controlled.\par \par \uc2 It wasn't a debate, just a slanging match.\par \par \uc2 With Katie as the only pro-indigenous Briton versus a 50 per cent-plus \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  audience, she was hardly given the chance to say her piece. No wonder she got heated about it.\par \par \uc2 Why should we let ourselves be walked over by foreigners?\par \par \uc2 We are in danger of losing our cultural heritage if we become a minority.\par \par \uc2 TREVOR ROWE By email\par \par \uc2 CHANNEL 5 should be ashamed of itself. That was no debate. They should have guaranteed a 50/50 split in the audience.\par \par \uc2 KELLY HORTON Perth\par \par \uc2 KATIE HOPKINS was a disgrace to political debate.\par \par \uc2 How can anyone give credence or reward to this loud-mouthed and intolerant woman? \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  and the economy are far more important issues than getting headlines or courting controversy.\par \par \uc2 IAN BRAMWELL By email\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140224ea2o000gb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

\par\par \b \uc2 G4S loses Australia contract after asylum seeker riot\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jamie Smyth in Sydney   \par \uc2 547 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 February 2014\par 08:25\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Australia has axed G4S, the British outsourcing and security company, as the lead contractor running its Manus Island detention centre for asylum seekers on Papua New Guinea, a week after an Iranian inmate was killed during a riot.\par \par \uc2 Canberra said on Monday it has agreed a A$1.22bn contract with \uc2 Transfield Services\uc2 , an Australian-based outsourcer that runs a similar detention centre on the south Pacific island of Nauru.\par \par \uc2 Transfield will in the coming days take over the management of the PNG centre, where 1,300 asylum seekers are being held awaiting a decision on claims for refugee status.\par \par \uc2 "The government is in the process now of G4S transitioning out along with the Salvation Army. Transfield is transitioning in to ensure there is one system that operates across both of these centres," said the department of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Canberra insisted that the change of operator on Manus Island was already in train and was not related to last week's riot at the processing centre, during which a 23-year old asylum seeker Reza Berati died and more than 70 people were injured.\par \par \uc2 However, the death of Mr Berati has provoked a public outcry across Australia with thousands of people holding candlelit vigils in several cities over the weekend. The opposition is calling for the resignation of Scott Morrison, Australia's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, who bungled the release of information immediately after the riot.\par \par \uc2 There are conflicting reports over what happened during the riot with some detainees and an interpreter employed by \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  authorities at the Manus Island centre alleging asylum seekers were attacked by some local people and local employees of G4S.\par \par \uc2 Mr Morrison has ordered an independent review into the incident, which will look into the conduct of the "service providers" and "other persons" present in the compound on the night of the riot.\par \par \uc2 Tony Abbott\uc2 , Australia's prime minister, defended Mr Morrison, saying: "You don't want a wimp running border protection."\par \par \uc2 G4S said would co-operate with the review.\par \par \uc2 Australian government policy on asylum seekers and "boat people" - a term coined in the 1970s - has long been contentious. The previous Labor government said in 2013 that any boat people without a visa would be sent to PNG to have their asylum claim assessed.\par \par \uc2 Even if they were found to be refugees, they would be settled in PNG under an agreement brokered between the two governments. Between September 2008 and November 2013, more than 51,000 people arrived illegally by boat in\u160\'00\'A0Australia. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Mr Abbott, elected in September, has stepped up the rhetoric against "boat people" by launching "Operation Sovereign Borders" - a policy that involves turning back any boats carrying asylum seekers that attempt to enter Australian waters.\par \par \uc2 The crackdown on asylum seekers in Australia and the creation of offshore processing centres and detention facilities is proving to be a bonanza for big business.\par \par \uc2 Transfield's contract to provide garrison and welfare services at Nauru and Manus island detention centres is worth A$1.22bn over 20 months. The company's shares rose 25 pe cent 99 cents on Monday following its contract win.\par \par \uc2 British company \uc2 Serco\uc2  has been paid almost A$2bn to run onshore detention centres in Australia since 2009.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140224ea2o000xd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

There are 320,000 homes in Leeds.\par \par \uc2 Home Secretary Theresa May and Planning Minister Nick Boles have both voiced fears over the unchecked flood of new migrants, which could send property prices rocketing.\par \par \uc2 Pressure Alp Mehmet, the vice-chairman of MigrationWatch, said: "It is entirely logical that mass migration will have an impact on house prices.\par \par \uc2 "If you get demand going up while supply remains stationary, house prices will rise. The higher the prices, the more first-time buyers are going to find it difficult to get their own place.\par \par \uc2 "I think the political classes haven't factored in the impact on housing. If you look at London and the South-east the pressure is even greater because so much migration takes place."\par \par \uc2 The figures, held in the House of Commons library, are likely to heap further pressure on Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  to keep his pledge to reduce net migration levels to "tens of thousands" before the next election. A total of 1.8 million \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  have arrived in Britain since 2004.\par \par \uc2 The research was requested by Tory MP James Clappison, a member of the home affairs select committee.\par \par \uc2 He said: "Labour pursued an open door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy and gave no thought to the consequences.\par \par \uc2 "The worry must be that a future Labour government will do that again."\par \par \uc2 Carlos Vargas-Silva, senior researcher at \uc2 Oxford University\uc2 's Migration Observatory, believes massive numbers of migrants will also send rents soaring.\par \par \uc2 He said: "Most migrants when they arrive in the country rent, and that is where the main impact is.\par \par \uc2 "The increase in rents may displace British nationals. They may end up going into social housing because the price of rent is too high.\par \par \uc2 "Indirectly this could have an effect on house prices because it encourages people to buy-to-let. Over the long term, if migrants stay they are more likely to buy houses and potentially put pressure on the housing market."\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140224ea2o0001l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

Tory MP Nick de Bois said: "It is deeply worrying that so many foreign criminals are walking the streets. Urgent action must be taken to find them.\par \par \uc2 "The British public are losing patience with so\u8211\'20\'13called human rights claims. These criminals should be thrown out of this country and put back in jail in their country of origin."\par \par \uc2 As well as protecting the criminals' identities, the Home Office also refused to name the countries they came from, claiming it might undermine its ability to negotiate deportation in future.\par \par \uc2 A Home Office spokesman said: "We believe foreign nationals who break our rules should be removed from the UK at the earliest opportunity.\par \par \uc2 "Last year we removed more than 4,500 foreign national offenders.\par \par \uc2 "When individuals abscond, we work closely with police and probation services and employ specialist trace teams to return these individuals to prison."\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140224ea2o0001o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

The aim of the visit from our point of view will be to get German support for EU reform, or at least to establish where there is common ground between us. The aim from the German point of view is to help Britain stay in the EU.\par \par \uc2 That is oversimplifying, but you see the point. Germany is the great economic anchor of the eurozone, but as the German chancellor herself noted in a speech last year, her country's strength is not infinite. The country needs successful neighbours. While Britain is third to France and the US as a destination for German exports, it is the largest export market for the eurozone as a whole.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, for the first time since the 1970s, we are now exporting more to non-European countries than we are to Europe. Nevertheless, we too need a successful Europe, and the key to that is Germany.\par \par \uc2 Beyond this obvious common interest, there is something else. Germany and the UK have the strongest job markets in Europe. In terms of economic growth, we are at last starting to outpace Germany. But we have for the past three years both been the only significant sources of new jobs in Europe. We are similarly competing for top talent, with Germany easing its regulations on highly skilled workers from outside the EU 18 months ago, and Cameron this month announcing a modified visa for people with "exceptional talent".\par \par \uc2 One fascinating thing that has happened in the EU in the past five years is that we have moved some way towards a single market in labour. People move countries for jobs in a way that would have been almost unthinkable 10 years ago. We see this in the UK, where roughly a third of the jobs created over the past year have gone to people born outside the country. Germany is the second-largest destination for EU migrants.\par \par \uc2 If the magnet of opportunity is attracting people to the stronger economies, the lack of opportunity is expelling people from countries such as Italy and Spain. Italian emigration was 68,000 in 2012 while Spain is projected to lose more than 200,000 a year for the next decade. Of course, not all the people leaving southern Europe are highly skilled but I saw what for Italy must be an alarming statistic. A quarter of the people leaving the country have degrees.\par \par \uc2 A true single European market for labour does not yet exist because there are all sorts of frictions, including language, professional qualifications, and so on. But we have enough of one now to see what sort of EU we are moving towards. It is a world of winners and losers. There are three main features to this. First, the weight of the European economy is shifting from the periphery to the core. The general movement is north \u8212\'20\'14 away from the Mediterranean \u8212\'20\'14 but it is not as simple as that, for within the UK the move is to London and the South East.\par \par \uc2 Populations are moving, creating greater physical pressure on the winning areas in infrastructure, housing and so on. We are very aware of that in London, and one of the great challenges will be how to cope with that in a decent and socially acceptable way. We are less aware of the consequences of depopulation. To see that, you go to the half-built housing estates in Ireland and Spain.\par \par \uc2 Second, this is a Europe for the highly skilled. They are mobile and they are moving. That puts more pressure on EU governments to up-skill their workforce, but the problem is that this is an achingly slow process. Even Germany, with its system of technical education developed over several generations, is struggling to fill skill gaps.\par \par \uc2 A Europe that works for the skilled but not for the less-skilled maybe an outcome of global economic change, but it is not one that its citizens will easily accept, particularly since the European welfare model is unsustainable.\par \par \uc2 As Merkel noted, Europe's problem is that it accounts for 7% of the world's population, 25% of its GDP and 50% of its social spending.\par \par \uc2 That leads to the third winner/loser distinction, less obvious right now but potentially the most corrosive of all. Could it be that Europe as a whole will be a loser? It is inevitable that its economic weight in the world will tend to shrink, but it should be possible despite the headwind of ageing populations to go on increasing the standard of living of most of its citizens.\par \par \uc2 BUT you can't do that with the levels of unemployment in much of the eurozone. Were the idea that Europe is a loser to take hold, then\u8230\'20\'26 well, let's not go there just yet.\par \par \uc2 It is, however, this Europe of winners and losers that Cameron and Angela have to confront.\par \par \uc2 They represent the two most successful large economies of the region, both with rather different problems, but both with great opportunities. I suggest the cautious, thoughtful Chancellor has much to teach the intuitive, intelligent Prime Minister, but maybe something to learn too.\par \par \uc2 THE GREAT \b \uc2 IMMIGRATION\b0 \uc2  DEBATE Evening Standard Guildhall EC2, 6.30pm, March 3.

\par\par \uc2 Editorial; Opinion, Columns\par \b \uc2 Base \uc2 immigration\uc2  on people, services and numbers\b0\par\par\uc2 Shaun Bailey   \par \uc2 1,079 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 February 2014\par \uc2 London Evening Standard\par \uc2 NS\par \uc2 1; National\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited   \par \par \uc2 The EU must allow us to ensure migrants are adding to, not further straining, our economy and public services\par \par \uc2 FIRST off, I am going to offend you. How do I know this? We are talking \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and there are few more emotive topics. With the European elections looming, the perceived threat to all the main parties from Ukip and the backdrop of an economy in a fragile recovery, it seems that being tough on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is gaining momentum.\par \par \uc2 This paper's debate on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  next Monday is a useful contribution to discussion of the subject. There are realities about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  which we have to face up to and this will be an opportunity to address them.\par \par \uc2 At the outset, let me acknowledge that London owes an awful lot to its cosmopolitan character. The sense that London is a welcoming city makes the capital attractive to overseas investors. London will always need some \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and most migrants come here to work, and work hard.\par \par \uc2 Yet any sane conversation about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has to acknowledge the costs of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as well as its benefits. For many Londoners, particularly poor Londoners, it can seem that the costs outweigh the benefits. This would matter less if the numbers weren't so big. Granted, the Government has managed to reduce net migration and this is very welcome. But the numbers coming here are still large \u8212\'20\'14 net migration was 182,000 in the year to last June \u8212\'20\'14 and they add to the numbers already here. Under Labour, nearly four million people came here and a million British people left \u8212\'20\'14 that's a net influx of nearly three million. Many of them gravitate towards London so the pressure on resources here is disproportionate.\par \par \uc2 Why do I say \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  affects the poorest Londoners first and hardest? They are the people who are competing with European and other migrants for the same jobs, services and housing. Most come here to work rather than claim benefits. None of this is of any comfort if you are London-born and unable to find work or housing. Because the newcomers can often afford to work for low wages due to their temporary status, or their acceptance of lower living standards, they force wages down for the poorest paid. That has an effect on young British people \u8212\'20\'14 many of what used to be starter jobs now go to new arrivals.\par \par \uc2 What's more we all have to pay for the public services and benefits that new migrants enjoy. There is a feeling among Londoners that we are providing a health service for the entire world. We have a non-contributory welfare system, yet the numbers seeking healthcare can seem like a never-ending queue. It does not feel fair for new \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to use freely what Londoners pay for.\par \par \uc2 Of course the example of the \uc2 NHS\uc2  illustrates the paradoxical nature of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . I have to point out that our \uc2 NHS\uc2  would not be viable without its large numbers of foreign-born workers. Indeed many parts of London's economy would not work if not for migrant workers.\par \par \uc2 What about housing? The pressure on housing in London is well-documented and clearly, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  plays a part in that. Some will say that the impact for public housing is small; however, if you are in need of housing but cannot get any, you start to turn on your neighbour, and people who look different are the easiest to blame. So European migrants who are more able to blend in do not face quite the same pressure as migrants from elsewhere but still pose the same issues for our infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 London is a city of every race. Avoiding racial tension is crucial. It is also of central importance to our international standing. We need clarity with any \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy, based on people, numbers and services.\par \par \uc2 The greatest bar to such a policy is the \uc2 European Union\uc2  rule whereby any EU citizen can live and work in any member state. That means we have no say in how many people come here. It is something David Cameron is trying to address in the renegotiation talks.\par \par \uc2 This is a problem faced by other prosperous EU states as well as Britain, and it may be that the Prime Minister will have support from other governments in trying to make the system more flexible. It is a difficult balance to strike \u8212\'20\'14 this country must not appear overly emotional, still less protectionist, when it comes to free movement in Europe \u8212\'20\'14 but these rules must be changed if people are to feel that the Government controls \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  numbers.\par \par \uc2 We cannot have too severe a restriction on people coming in and out of London, however. This would affect the bottom line of London plc. As a city we have benefited from the free movement of goods and capital across Europe and the world and we cannot expect this without some movement of people.\par \par \uc2 Yet reform is in the interests of the EU; it would make the Union seem relevant to its citizens. If we do not have concessions from the EU on the rules about free movement, it will alienate more than just British people \u8212\'20\'14 this is an issue faced by others in the EU.\par \par \uc2 It's true, of course, that migration is a two-way process. Many Britons want to live and work abroad too: there are large expatriate communities from here to Dubai. But even allowing for that, net migration figures are still a long way off Government targets.\par \par \uc2 The \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  bill, for all its problems, is looking in the right direction: a cap on maximum numbers and a restriction on access to benefits is where much of the answer lies. \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  need to know when they can and cannot come here, and we need to know they are adding to, not further straining, our economy and public services. There is no silver bullet, no single answer to the problem, but this bill will help by making Britain seem less of a soft touch than before.\par \par \uc2 A more coherent \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy, properly implemented, will help all communities.\par \par \uc2 The Standard and the City of London are hosting a major public debate, Does London Need More \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2 ?, next Monday.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Bernard Randall, the British man facing a trial in Uganda for possessing a gay sex video, is to deported back to the UK immediately after all charges against him were dropped.\par \par \uc2 The 65-year-old, originally from Faversham in Kent, had been facing a possible two-year prison sentence after being charged with \u8220\'20\'1Ctrafficking obscene publications".\par \par \uc2 Today, magistrate Hellen Ajio ordered that the charges \u8211\'20\'13 which Randall strongly denied \u8211\'20\'13 be dropped and that the former computer analyst be deported from the east African country within 12 hours on the basis that his visa had expired.\par \par \uc2 Handing down the ruling, she told Randall: \u8220\'20\'1CIn Uganda we love you, but we don\u8217\'20\'19t love the acts of homosexuals. I\u8217\'20\'19ve told you time and time again that God loves you."\par \par \uc2 The decision comes just weeks after Uganda\u8217\'20\'19s parliament passed a draconian anti-gay bill imposing life in prison for people convicted of some homosexual acts.\par \par \uc2 Nightmare is over for gay Briton Bernard Randall put on trial in Uganda after images of him having sex were stolen by thieves and used against him in 'blackmail plot'\par \par \uc2 Randall appeared in Entebbe Magistrates Court with Albert Cheptoyek, 33, a Ugandan national, who still faces a prison sentence of up to seven years if found guilty of \u8220\'20\'1Cacts of gross indecency", which he denies. The pair claim that their home was robbed last September and Randall\u8217\'20\'19s laptop, which contained images of him having sex with another man in Morocco, was stolen. The alleged thieves passed the images to Pastor Solomon Moses Male, who leads the country\u8217\'20\'19s anti-homosexuality crusade and gave them to tabloid newspaper Red Pepper.\par \par \uc2 At one stage during the hearing a prosecutor said the retiree would \u8220\'20\'1Ccontinue to corrupt morals" if he stayed in Uganda, causing a visibly upset and shaken Randall to scream: \u8220\'20\'1CLies!". The prosecution had argued for Randall\u8217\'20\'19s deportation. The defence had requested he be given five days to leave the country.\par \par \uc2 Uganda passes anti-gay law with maximum sentence of life imprisonmentUgandan President Yoweri Museveni blocks anti-gay law\par \par \uc2 Defence lawyer John Francis Onyango told The Independent he was \u8220\'20\'1Chappy" the charges had been dropped because there was \u8220\'20\'1Cno adequate evidence" to charge Mr Randall.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut we\u8217\'20\'19re concerned about his deportation on the flimsy grounds of non-renewal of his visa," Onyango said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe prosecution know that his passport had been robbed and that he actually reported to the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  department to renew his visa and his request was actually denied, back in December."\par \par \uc2 He said they would not be appealing the ruling because it \u8220\'20\'1Cwon\u8217\'20\'19t serve any meaningful purpose".\par \par \uc2 The lawyer added that the case against Cheptoyek was now \u8220\'20\'1Cextremely weak" as he and Randall were jointly charged.\par \par \uc2 Speaking after the ruling, Cheptoyek told The Independent that Randall was being deported for reasons which were \u8220\'20\'1Cnot good or fair".\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think they\u8217\'20\'19re deporting him because he\u8217\'20\'19s gay," Cheptoyek said.\par \par \uc2 When asked how he felt about his own situation he said: \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m scared. The bill has passed. The government of Uganda don\u8217\'20\'19t want gays."\par \par \uc2 A member of the UK High Commission was present in court, but did not comment.\par \par \uc2 Last week, it was reported that President Yoweri Museveni had blocked the anti-gay Bill, but gay rights activists in Kampala stressed that he hadn\u8217\'20\'19t done so but had only \u8220\'20\'1Cpromised and expressed his concerns" about the legislation.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140224ea2o003s5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Home News\par \b \uc2 Plan to sell British visas to the highest bidders \u8216\'20\'18sends out the wrong message\b0\par\par\uc2 Nigel Morris   \par \uc2 604 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 February 2014\par 20:55\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A proposal to auction British visas to millionaire bidders would cause public anger and damage the country\u8217\'20\'19s reputation abroad, ministers have been warned.\par \par \uc2 They are considering a shake-up of the system, which allows super-rich foreign nationals to settle in Britain, following claims it could be modified to boost investment in this country. One option to be set out today by the Government\u8217\'20\'19s migration advisory committee (MAC) is that a number of visas are set aside each year to be auctioned to the highest bidders.\par \par \uc2 Other alternatives to be floated include requiring investors to make \u8220\'20\'1Cendowments" to universities. At the moment, applicants for \u8220\'20\'1Cinvestor visas" pay between \u163\'00\'A31m and \u163\'00\'A310m to create a fast-track route to permission to live permanently in Britain. Investors who pay \u163\'00\'A310m can gain the right to residency in just two years.\par \par \uc2 However, Sir David Metcalfe, head of the MAC, has signalled his determination to overhaul the system, arguing most investors buy government gilts which they later sell, meaning there is little lasting benefit to the economy. Some Whitehall officials are sympathetic to the scheme, which carries echoes of a recent proposal by Malta to sell passports for \u163\'00\'A3500,000, giving holders the right to live anywhere in the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . One official told The Independent: \u8220\'20\'1CA lot of these people are very high-worth individuals. Perhaps we can be more demanding of them."\par \par \uc2 But \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  lawyers urged the Home Office and Department for Business to resist the proposal. Julia Onslow-Cole, head of global \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at PwC Legal, said: \u8220\'20\'1CIn the current climate I don\u8217\'20\'19t think it would sit very well with the public to put investor visas up to the highest bidder. I think we should be proud that we in the UK treat our \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  categories very seriously and in a considered way. Under the current system we expect people to make a significant investment in the UK."\par \par \uc2 Nichola Carter, the principal solicitor of Carter Thomas, said it would be unworkable to check whether bidders were suitable to apply for residency. She said: \u8220\'20\'1CHow are they going to vet people before auctions take place? The idea that any aspect of British citizenship is open to the highest bidder runs contrary to every message the Government has sent out."\par \par \uc2 Sophie Barrett-Brown, a senior partner at Laura Devine Solicitors, said the Home Office had rightly rejected a proposed auction system on a previous occasion because it \u8220\'20\'1Csent out the wrong message to the public".\par \par \uc2 Although the Home Office did not comment last night, it is expected eventually to veto the auction plan. It was critical of the Maltese move, warning it would not tolerate \u8220\'20\'1Cabuse" of the EU\u8217\'20\'19s free movement rules.\par \par \uc2 Just over 500 investor visas were issued in 2012-13, an increase of some 25 per cent on the previous 12 months. The largest number went to Chinese nationals, followed by Russians and Americans.\par \par \uc2 In December, David Cameron told business leaders during a visit to China: \u8220\'20\'1CIf you are investing in Britain, invest more. If you are thinking of investing in Britain, come and find us. You will get a warm welcome."\par \par \uc2 David Hanson, the shadow \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, said: \u8220\'20\'1COur visa system should encourage entrepreneurs and investors to come to the UK and ensure people add value to Britain. We\u8217\'20\'19ll look at the detail of these recommendations closely, but the visa system should be fair, effective and encourage proper social and economic investment in the UK in the areas it is needed."\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140225ea2o000b5\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15
