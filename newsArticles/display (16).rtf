Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 "I'M A friendly, affable bloke, but there are limits," warns Grant Shapps.\par \par \uc2 The Conservative chairman has just fired one of his deputies, Michael Fabricant, for rebelling against the Government's plans for the High Speed 2 rail project and a series of comments on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  which were deemed "unbecoming" of a party vice-chairman.\par \par \uc2 "It was probably the friendliest sacking you'll ever see," Mr Shapps says. "But in the end I wasn't prepared to have somebody as part of my team who is in Parliament working against the Government's own policy."\par \par \uc2 As the official responsible for overseeing the Conservative campaign, and recruiting activists to the cause, Mr Shapps is not for taking prisoners and Tory rebels should beware.\par \par \uc2 His neck is on the line as much as anyone's if Ed Miliband wins power at next year's general election.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Shapps has a more immediate battle on his hands. In one month's time, voters across the UK will elect Members of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , along with councillors in 161 English local authorities. A poor showing for the party on May 22 could cost Mr Shapps his job well before the general election contest begins.\par \par \uc2 Most commentators expect the European elections to be grim for the Conservatives, and for Right-wingers in the party to go into a tailspin in the aftermath of a heavy defeat.\par \par \uc2 In the week after Maria Miller's resignation over expenses, the chairman is in no mood to compromise.\par \par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph's ICM poll today discloses the scale of defections the Tories face - one third of voters who backed the Conservatives in 2010 plan to vote for Nigel Farage's party next month. Why is the UK Independence Party so popular?\par \par \uc2 "I'm not here to commentate on polls," Mr Shapps responds. "My job as party chairman and a member of the Cabinet is to let people know what the election is about and what is at stake. This election is about Britain's future relationship with Europe. We have to win it on the arguments."\par \par \uc2 But surely it is essential to understand why Conservative voters are deserting the party in favour of Ukip, or does he no longer care about winning these people back? "I'm just not engaging in the speculative side of this," comes the blunt reply.\par \par \uc2 What about Mr Farage, whose pintswigging appeal has turned Britain into a four-party country?\par \par \uc2 "I leave Farage's message to him."\par \par \uc2 The refusal to discuss how to beat Ukip, which even those close to \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  privately admit is the Tories' biggest challenge, seems perverse, given the current state of the polls. Eventually, Mr Shapps reveals a small glimpse of his plan to neutralise the Ukip offer of curbing \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and cutting Britain's ties with Brussels. "If you care about some of the things Nigel Farage says he cares about, the way to get them is to vote Conservative," he says.\par \par \uc2 Some MPs believe the party's chances would be improved by Boris Johnson running for Parliament at the general election, and ultimately replacing Mr Cameron as leader. Even the Prime Minister envies the Mayor of London's ability to "defy political gravity", which means that no amount of trouble in his private life seems capable of denting his wide public appeal.\par \par \uc2 "It's entirely up to Boris what he does. He is a big boy, he can make up his own mind," Mr Shapps says.\par \par \uc2 However, the party chairman is clear that the mayor would get no special favours if he chose to stand for Parliament in 2015. "These seats come and go and he would have to win one. He would have to apply for a seat.\par \par \uc2 "I think Boris is great," he adds, quickly. "It would be great to have him back in Parliament."\par \par \uc2 Are there not already too many "posh white boys" running the Conservative Party? "This obsession from exactly which bit of society we all came from is an obsession only with the press and Labour," Mr Shapps claims.\par \par \uc2 "Actually, people are more interested in where people are going to, not where they came from."\par \par \uc2 None the less, image is important in politics, and senior Tories including Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, have noted critically that Mr Cameron's inner circle is dominated by Old Etonians and Oxbridge graduates from similarly gilded backgrounds.\par \par \uc2 Mr Shapps turns back to Baroness Thatcher, the grocer's daughter, and Sir John Major, a Brixton lad, to show that "we all come from different backgrounds". "I went to a state school. This idea that we are all only from one background - some people are, and good luck to them - but I don't think we should hold it against people because they went to a posh school."\par \par \uc2 In Sajid Javid, who replaced Mrs Miller as Culture Secretary, the party can now boast Britain's "first male Asian in Cabinet".\par \par \uc2 Does this mean it's "job done" for broadening the Tory image? "Not job done at all, but it's progress, isn't it?"\par \par \uc2 Nando's - his choice of venue for the interview over lunch - could be viewed as part of the image Mr Shapps has sought to cultivate as a Tory in the Major and Thatcher tradition: ordinary boy made good. Not for him, the Michelin-starred dining beloved of the political elite. His order of half a flamegrilled chicken, with corn and rice, washed down with two large colas will have been replicated by thousands of office workers around Britain.\par \par \uc2 State-educated, he set up his own printing and design company more than 20 years ago, which is still running successfully. The business made him rich and he flies his own plane.\par \par \uc2 But his story has been far from easy.\par \par \uc2 He survived cancer and a car crash that left him in a coma for a week. Mr Shapps is better placed than some Tories to empathise with the struggles of ordinary families and businesses.\par \par \uc2 These "hardworking people" are the voters the Tories want to recruit in the 13 months between now and the election. Their best hope of doing so is to ensure families feel the benefit of the economic recovery in their daily lives.\par \par \uc2 Unemployment continues to fall, and figures last week marked an "important moment", Mr Shapps says, when wages began to rise faster than the price of household goods.\par \par \uc2 With a year to go until the general election, do people feel better off yet? "I think we still have some way to go," he says. "Labour took us to the biggest bust in 100 years and the truth is it's taken a long time - with no help from them - to get this economy back on track."\par \par \uc2 As chairman of the party, Mr Shapps has good reason to be treating next month's European and council elections deadly seriously. The Prime Minister is due to reshuffle his Cabinet for a final time in the summer and some in Westminster think Mr Shapps will be a casualty.\par \par \uc2 "The job of the chairman is to have big broad shoulders and impenetrably thick skin," he says.\par \par \uc2 'The job of the chairman is to have big broad shoulders'\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140420ea4k00005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 COMMENTARY\par \par \uc2 THE TORIES are bracing themselves for a kicking from the UK Independence Party in the European elections next month, with the party's high command so resigned to its fate that senior figures have even given up pretending that it will be anything other than a nightmarish experience.\par \par \uc2 Ministers and MPs are well aware of how challenging the situation is, with many core Conservative voters ready to defect to Nigel Farage's party. "Lots of my people will vote Ukip," says a long-serving Tory MP. Another told me recently that he suspects that more than half of the members of his local constituency association, the activists who are the backbone of the party, are closet Ukip supporters who will register a protest against \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  in May.\par \par \uc2 But the discontent of activists cannot alone explain the extraordinary rise of Ukip in recent years. The Tory party membership these days is small, with as few as 100,000 members remaining. It is clear that Mr Farage has also managed to tap into the deep unhappiness of the wider electorate with mainstream parties.\par \par \uc2 One of the most revealing aspects of today's ICM poll for The Sunday Telegraph is that many of Ukip's own voters say discontent with the Tories, Labour and the Liberal Democrats explains the party's popularity. Of those Ukip voters polled, almost a third, 29 per cent, thought it was the main reason, while more than 24 per cent chose the party's tough line on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Ukip's flagship policy of withdrawal from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  was cited by 41 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Clearly, Mr Farage's populist message appeals to voters, particularly older voters, who feel that a remote Westminster elite has betrayed them or been contemptuous of their concerns in recent years.\par \par \uc2 This means that, for now, the normal rules do not seem to apply to Ukip, with the party's supporters according it a special status.\par \par \uc2 When other parties become mired in claims of sleaze and financial chicanery it tends to do them harm in opinion polls and elections. That is not, yet, the case when it comes to Ukip.\par \par \uc2 Claims of scandal simply bounce off Nigel Farage. Despite him facing allegations last week that he abused the allowances he receives as a member of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , Mr Farage's party is still riding high, with 27 per cent of those polled by ICM saying they will back Ukip in May. That puts the party ahead of the Conservatives, who are on 22 per cent, and just behind Labour on 30 per cent. The claims about Mr Farage's office costs were in the news while the latest ICM poll for The Sunday Telegraph was being conducted, but they seem to have had no impact on the party's popularity.\par \par \uc2 Whether voters leaning to Ukip suspect that the other parties and the media are smearing Mr Farage because they fear him, or whether they take it as a given that all parties have been known to fiddle their expenses, his status as an insurgent rebel fighting the system makes it very difficult for the Tories to get a clear line of attack on Ukip. It is not clear that a more aggressive approach on the part of the Conservatives would make a difference. Mr Cameron's previous disastrous attempts to discredit Ukip only succeeded in inflaming his opponents. When in 2006 he referred to Ukip members as "fruitcakes, loons and closet racists" it probably gave the party a boost.\par \par \uc2 The Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, also discovered recently that challenging Mr Farage to a fight can backfire. Despite the Liberal Democrat leader's reputation as a formidable debater on television, he was crushed by Mr Farage when the pair clashed in two televised encounters. In today's ICM poll the Lib Dems are at 8 per cent.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, in recent months the Tories have tried a policy of what George Brown, a Labour foreign secretary in the Sixties, used to refer to as "complete ignoral", in the vain hope that avoiding mentioning Mr Farage will mitigate the damage he will do to the Tories in May.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately for Mr Cameron, the Ukip leader's voracious appetite for publicity, and his knack of exploiting Tory travails such as the botched resignation of the former culture secretary Maria Miller, mean that he is more visible and self-confident than ever.\par \par \uc2 The hope in the Tory high command is that this is a passing phase and that, while the next month will be intensely difficult, the impact may not be long-lasting. If the Tory party can avoid losing its head in the days and weeks after the European elections, strategists hope that voters will then return to the Conservatives because of the recovering economy and the prospect of Ed Miliband moving into Downing Street.\par \par \uc2 The question is whether this is an enduring split in the centre-Right vote that will continue beyond the European elections or a temporary protest vote that fades fast as the general election looms. This weekend, the Tory leadership will be praying that it is the latter.\par \par \uc2 Matthew d'Ancona: Page 22\par \par \uc2 Q1.EUROPEAN ELECTIONS-HOW WILL YOU VOTE?\par \par \uc2 30%\par \par \uc2 Q2.

It\u8217\'20\'19s a question Aussies have long been pondering\u160\'00\'A0 as poll after poll revealed a steady decline in support for the Monarchy.\par \par \uc2 Australia is one of the most multicultural countries on Earth \u8211\'20\'13 a human minestrone. Its Asian, Arabic, European and Pacific \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  have no allegiance to a castle-encrusted, corgi-caressing Royal Family, 11,000 miles away. Sydney is also sequin-central, rivalling San Francisco as the world\u8217\'20\'19s gay capital\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. which is why if you mention \u8216\'20\'18the Queen\u8217\'20\'19 to most Aussie kids, they presume you\u8217\'20\'19re talking about Elton John.\par \par \uc2 But rampant republicanism was stopped in its tracks last week because of a visit from the younger Royals. Kate and Wills are like a stealth weapon, flying right under the republican radar. Wills, with Diana\u8217\'20\'19s designer genes and that 100-watt smile, has perfected the role of Knight in Shining\u160\'00\'A0 Armani. And then there\u8217\'20\'19s his choice of bride.\par \par \uc2 In Australia, \u8216\'20\'18breeding\u8217\'20\'19 is something we do with sheep. But in England a girl can find herself looking up so many noses \u8211\'20\'13 even people shorter than you. Upper-class foreplay is normally a case of \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19ll let you play with my hyphen, if I can play with yours\u8217\'20\'19. But William has chosen to marry a commoner \u8211\'20\'13 which egalitarian\u160\'00\'A0 Australians respect.\par \par \uc2 Then there\u8217\'20\'19s the ultimate weapon in the Royal PR machine \u8211\'20\'13 baby George. Why did he have to be so darn cute? So powerful is the bonsai Royal\u8217\'20\'19s effect that locals are calling him the Republicanator.\par \par \uc2 Earthy Aussies are sceptical about everything \u8211\'20\'13 they have chronic sceptic-emia. But who could resist that chubby-thighed hunk of cheeky gorgeousness?\par \par \uc2 And so for the time being, republicanism is as wilted as a 1980s perm in a sauna. Tony Abbott, the conservative Monarchist PM, has even reintroduced damehoods and knighthoods, which were\u160\'00\'A0 abolished by Australia\u8217\'20\'19s Labor Party in the 1970s. (While publically scathing about Abbott\u8217\'20\'19s lickspittle toadyism, I do secretly fancy being dubbed \u8216\'20\'18Lady Lette\u8217\'20\'19\u8230\'20\'26 Then I can\u160\'00\'A0 buy that island off Scotland called Muck. Lady Muck.\u160\'00\'A0 Now there\u8217\'20\'19s a title I\u8217\'20\'19d kill\u160\'00\'A0 for.) But if the Royals really want to assimilate, my top etiquette tip is that Australia clearly has everything in common with England, except the language. Antipodeans are not loquacious.In fact, most blokes think that YES or NO are perfectly adequate responses to any question.\par \par \uc2 But in formal situations, the male of the species tends to employ a robust bantering style. Wills should greet Abbott using the following lingo.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18How\u8217\'20\'19s it hangin\u8217\'20\'19, Chook?\u8217\'20\'19 \u8216\'20\'18Low and lazy, Dingo.\u8217\'20\'19 \u8216\'20\'18Gettin\u8217\'20\'19 any, horn bag?\u8217\'20\'19 \u8216\'20\'18Jeez, I\u8217\'20\'19m flat out runnin\u8217\'20\'19 tryin\u8217\'20\'19 to get away from it.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Having glimpsed Prince\u160\'00\'A0 William peering over the Blue Mountains precipice, we know the Royals are at home in the wild.\par \par \uc2 But they must also be prepared for the wild to be at home in them. Australian spiders are the size of a small English cattle dog and our cockroaches so big and brazen, they practically cruise around in 4x4s\u160\'00\'A0 with sub-machine guns, terrorising locals.\par \par \uc2 But it would cause a diplomatic incident if the Royal couple whinge. We Aussies are tough and laid- back. When trouble strikes, we tend to erupt into a great nonchalance.\par \par \uc2 In other words, if you break a leg abseiling down that Blue Mountains gorge, Wills, don\u8217\'20\'19t come running to me.\par \par \uc2 And most important tip of all, the Royals should avoid making any quips about Aussie record collections being criminal rather than classical.\par \par \uc2 I think it\u8217\'20\'19s important that I pass on to the Palace the advice my grandma gave me when I told her I was moving to England.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Oh Kath, you can\u8217\'20\'19t possibly live in London.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18That\u8217\'20\'19s where all those terrible convicts come from.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Save your relationship... split up!\par \par \uc2 With Gwyneth and Chris Martin cooing and cuddling again, Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones pictured arm in arm in public, and Fergie and Andrew happily claiming BF status\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. perhaps the way to save your marriage is to separate.\par \par \uc2 Love prepares you for marriage the way needlepoint prepares you for round-the-world solo yachting. Wedding ceremonies should really be performed only at Lourdes, because it obviously takes a miracle to make a marriage work.\par \par \uc2 Increased longevity means from honeymoon to tomb, about 60 or 70 years. With marriages potentially lasting so much longer, perhaps nuptial contracts should be\u160\'00\'A0 renegotiated every ten years,\u160\'00\'A0 as you would with a job.\par \par \uc2 Or maybe matrimony should go the way of other archaic traditions, like human sacrifice \u8211\'20\'13 which, interestingly enough, also takes place on an altar.\par \par \uc2 Or just \u8216\'20\'18consciously uncouple\u8217\'20\'19, then joyfully date your mate all\u160\'00\'A0 over again.\par \par \uc2 The fussy face of love\par \par \uc2 With the demise of maypole dancing and dowries, how to find your altar ego?\par \par \uc2 Girlfriends who\u8217\'20\'19ve been on so many blind dates they could be given a free dog, swear by a dating app called Tinder, which showcases the faces of available men in your vicinity.\par \par \uc2 You then simply swipe \u8216\'20\'18right\u8217\'20\'19 if they\u8217\'20\'19re hot, and \u8216\'20\'18left\u8217\'20\'19 if they\u8217\'20\'19re not. But, unlike dates, surely love should be blind?\par \par \uc2 Tinder seems to me like an exercise in facial prejudice.\par \par \uc2 When you wish upon a Michelin star, dreams can come true, right? Ah, no. The sad truth is that many a true word is spoken ingest. For me, preparing the Easter Sunday family lunch extravaganza is more nerve-racking than a samurai initiation.\par \par \uc2 Put it this way, I use my smoke alarm as a timer. I will cut my finger, sob into a tea towel, comfort eat a cocoa plantation of Lindt, throw a cook book through the window\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. then dial my finger to the bone ordering take-outs. Emmeline Pankhurst did not tie herself to the railings so I\u8217\'20\'19d be tethered by a tea towel to the Aga. If women stop dicing and slicing, perhaps blokes will learn to be at home on the range? Boys, the way to a woman\u8217\'20\'19s heart is through her stomach.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage will never have a better chance to break the mould of British politics.\par \par \uc2 If UKIP can top the poll in the European elections in four weeks\u8217\'20\'19 time, the public will have delivered a vote of no confidence in the entire ruling political class.\par \par \uc2 No one will be able to dismiss UKIP as a bunch of cranks. They\u8217\'20\'19ll be the winners of a national election - and will have to be treated as such.\par \par \uc2 Before polling day, Farage will be drinking pints of\u160\'00\'A0 bitter rather than gin and tonics. Why? Because UKIP believes their victory lies in winning over blue-collar, Labour voters.\par \par \uc2 Alarmingly for David Cameron, Farage is concentrating on Labour voters because he believes he already has a host of Tory supporters in his column.\par \par \uc2 Senior Conservatives concede that at the General Election they can hope to win back only half those they\u8217\'20\'19ve lost.\par \par \uc2 The other half are so disillusioned with politics that they don\u8217\'20\'19t think it makes any difference whether Cameron or Miliband is Prime Minister.\par \par \uc2 They won\u8217\'20\'19t be moved by warnings that if you vote UKIP, you get Miliband.\par \par \uc2 For the moment, Farage\u8217\'20\'19s circle is relaxed about the stream of stories about UKIP expenses.\par \par \uc2 It believes that attacks from the so-called Establishment only add to its appeal. But Farage must keep his temper in check. If he blows a gasket on live TV, he\u8217\'20\'19ll blow UKIP\u8217\'20\'19s chances, too.\par \par \uc2 His \u8216\'20\'18Join the People\u8217\'20\'19s Army\u8217\'20\'19 campaign tour will begin in Yorkshire this week. His plan is to use \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as a battering ram to break into Labour\u8217\'20\'19s northern strongholds.\par \par \uc2 His message will be that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has hit working class jobs and wages and that only UKIP can do anything about it.\par \par \uc2 In an act of political ju-jitsu, Farage will also try to turn Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s cost-of-living attack on the Tories back against him.\par \par \uc2 He\u8217\'20\'19ll point out that the squeeze on wages began under Labour. UKIP\u160\'00\'A0 HQ believes that the voters\u8217\'20\'19 attitude to Labour is the same as Les Dawson\u8217\'20\'19s to his late mother-in-law: \u8216\'20\'18Gone but not forgiven.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The prize for UKIP isn\u8217\'20\'19t just electoral victory but forcing Miliband to offer a vote on membership of the EU.\par \par \uc2 One senior UKIP figure declares: \u8216\'20\'18Our dearest wish is to force Labour to revisit the referendum question.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Last month, Miliband made it clear that he would call a vote only in the event that more powers were going to be handed to Brussels.\par \par \uc2 But if UKIP top May\u8217\'20\'19s poll, Miliband will come under almost unbearable pressure to offer a referendum regardless.\par \par \uc2 For Cameron, coming third in a national election for the first time in Tory history is going to cause problems.\par \par \uc2 The Right is even now readying its demands. A Minister influential with this wing warns: \u8216\'20\'18The Right will be robust in pushing the party to reflect the realities of defeat.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The Right will also want its\u160\'00\'A0 people promoted in the reshuffle expected afterwards.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m told: \u8216\'20\'18The PM will have to look after the Eurosceptics and ensure that it is a reshuffle that promotes party unity.\u8217\'20\'19 If he doesn\u8217\'20\'19t do this, there will be trouble.\par \par \uc2 It isn\u8217\'20\'19t hard to see how this could lead to Tory defeat in 2015. If the party indulges in months of in-fighting, the public will tire of it.\par \par \uc2 But perhaps the biggest worry for Cameron is how many UKIP supporters don\u8217\'20\'19t think it makes any real difference whether it is Cameron or Miliband in No\u8201\'20\'0910.\par \par \uc2 These voters aren\u8217\'20\'19t going to be persuaded by Tory arguments that Cameron is a better Prime Minister than the Labour leader would be.\par \par \uc2 Their indifference could well let Miliband into Downing Street.\par \par \uc2 Ed pinning his hopes on Obama's bruiser\par \par \uc2 The prospect of Prime Minister Miliband just got more real. He has signed up the man who guided Barack Obama to two election victories.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, David Axelrod portrayed Obama\u8217\'20\'19s opponent Mitt Romney as an elitist who wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t help ordinary people. Obama won despite trailing on the economy.\par \par \uc2 Labour are hoping he can help them do the same.\par \par \uc2 Miliband has long needed to beef up his team but was reluctant to call on the New Labour past.\par \par \uc2 And as one Miliband ally gleefully declares: \u8216\'20\'18No one is now going to say, if only we had Peter Mandelson.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The 2015 Election will pit Axelrod against former colleague Jim Messina, now advising the Tories.\par \par \uc2 They fell out badly under Obama and I understand Axelrod became more interested in the job after Messina joined the Tories.\par \par \uc2 This all adds to the sense that the next Election is going to be the most bitter, and personal, political fight for a generation.\par \par \uc2 TV star or tech guru - the Tory women tipped to follow Boris\par \par \uc2 Two women are dominating Tory talks about who should one day succeed Boris Johnson as Mayor of London.\par \par \uc2 The dark horse is Joanna Shields, chairwoman of Tech City \u8211\'20\'13 Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s digital industry initiative. The leadership knows it takes a different kind of Tory to win in traditionally Labour London, and Shields, a naturalised American, is not a typical Tory.\par \par \uc2 But she is not well known. By contrast, Karren Brady is a TV star thanks to The Apprentice. She introduced George Osborne\u8217\'20\'19s last conference speech and was Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s small business tsar.\par \par \uc2 She also has London roots and is vice-chairman of West Ham Football Club.\par \par \uc2 Either way, if the Tories are going to get their candidate hired in the capital, they\u8217\'20\'19ll need someone as different from a normal politician as Boris is.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron and George Osborne will make a rare joint appearance on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The pair have long avoided public events together because the sight of them could reinforce the perception that the Tories are a party of posh boys.\par \par \uc2 This appearance marks the start of an effort to promote the team around Cameron. As backing for the strategy, No\u8201\'20\'0910 aides point to the lead that the pair already have over Miliband and Balls on economic competence.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, it is tempting to see this Tory emphasis on the team around Cameron as simply another way to get at Balls.\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140420ea4k000b9\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Revolt over Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s \u163\'00\'A320k bill to take an \u8216\'20\'18army of aides\u8217\'20\'19 on trip to Middle East\b0\par\par\uc2 BRENDAN CARLIN, MAIL ON SUNDAY POLITICAL REPORTER   \par \uc2 369 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 April 2014\par 02:31\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

As we listened to his relentless words - 'I see the Tiber running with blood' - intense depression gripped us. I knew he had taken the lid off Pandora's box and that race relations would never be the same again. This is certainly a historic turning point, but in which direction?"\par \par \uc2 24 APRIL 1754\par \par \uc2 John Wesley on preaching outside Hull: "A huge multitude, rich and poor, horse and foot, with several coaches, were soon gathered together; to whom I cried with a loud voice and a composed spirit, 'What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul.' Some thousands seriously attended, but many behaved as if possessed by Moloch. Clods and stones flew about on every side, but they neither touched nor disturbed me. When I had finished, I went to take coach; but the coachman had driven clear away. We were at a loss till a gentlewoman invited my wife and me to come into her coach. There were nine of us in the coach, three on each side, and three in the middle, but the mob closely attended us, throwing in at the windows whatever came next to hand. But a large gentlewoman who sat in my lap screened me, so that nothing came near."\par \par \uc2 24 APRIL 1996\par \par \uc2 Alec Guinness: "I'm glad I'm not having to undergo any surgery just now. Today's press is full of photographs of the Princess of Wales, in operating-theatre gear and pale make-up, sitting in on a serious operation. We are told she is doing the rounds of several hospitals. 'Pardon me, Your Royal Highness, but this is my hernia, and I don't want anyone to stitch it up except the surgeon. Another whiff of gas, nurse, if you don't mind, and leave out the Cal\u232\'00\'E8che Parfum.'"\par \par \uc2 Document INDOS00020140420ea4k00031\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw337\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5055\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Comment\par \par \uc2 In just over a month, after an extraordinary campaign, voters will go to the polls at the European election. Extraordinary because, when it comes to the central contest between the two parties that most polls have in first and second place - Labour and Ukip - Labour has been wholly absent.\par \par \uc2 Yes, there have been events, announcements and doors knocked, but almost nothing that directly challenges the politics of division peddled by Ukip. For example, in March, Ed Miliband mounted his biggest intervention to date on Europe, yet avoided any mention of Labour's closest challenger. It's as if Nigel Farage has become Labour's Voldemort - he whose name cannot be mentioned. The reason is simple: \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 When confronted with Ukip's scaremongering about European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , Labour vacillates. Instead of making a clear case on the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  for Britain, Labour spokespeople tie themselves up in knots of apologia.\par \par \uc2 Last week, Yvette Cooper gave a typically convoluted Labour speech on the topic. There was the mandatory apology for past \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from Eastern Europe, an acknowledgement of the contribution from some migrants, such as international students, and a pledge to crack down on unscrupulous employers who fail to pay the minimum wage. The latter points are valid but the speech failed to make the single most important argument on migration: that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  put more into Britain than they take out.\par \par \uc2 Their net contribution - equivalent to more than 4p on the basic rate of income tax, according to calculations by the \uc2 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\uc2  - helps fund our public services, cuts the deficit and reduces the pressure for deeper cuts or higher tax rises. This is the keystone of the case for migration. It rebuts Ukip's central charge on the costs of migration. Without it, Labour cedes the argument to Ukip and critically undermines its own case for Europe.\par \par \uc2 Labour has just hired the Obama guru David Axelrod to advise the party on its campaign approach. One of his first tasks should be to make clear to Ed Miliband that Labour needs directly to confront Britain's own Tea Party - Ukip - just as Obama has in the States. It is now impossible to win an argument for Britain in Europe without first demonstrating how we benefit from having Europeans in Britain.\par \par \uc2 As election day approaches, the tragedy for Labour is that the one British politician who seems to understand this is Nick Clegg. The Liberal Democrat leader has been vilified and sneered at for taking on Farage in those debates, but at least he was prepared to make the case. The polls might have gone against Clegg, but what do progressives expect when no one else has had the courage to take on the Ukip leader. Battles don't win themselves; they require politicians prepared to fight for what they believe in. I've spent much of my political life fighting Lib Dems. But, on this issue, I agree with Nick.\par \par \uc2 Barbara Roche is the chair of the Migration Matters Trust.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOS00020140420ea4k0002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw337\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5055\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 News | Barbara Roche is adamant that Labour's leader must confront Ukip on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - and soon\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband must have the "courage" to take on the threat from Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party directly, or risk a setback for his party at next month's European elections, a former Labour minister says today.\par \par \uc2 In The Independent on Sunday, Barbara Roche, chairman of the Migration Matters Trust and a minister in Tony Blair's government, writes that Mr Farage has become "Labour's Voldemort - he whose name cannot be mentioned" because Mr Miliband doesn't want to tackle Ukip on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She believes it is a "tragedy" for Labour that the only British politician who has had the "courage" to take on Ukip is Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. While the Deputy Prime Minister was trounced in his two debates with Mr Farage, at least he had been "prepared to fight" for what he believed in, Ms Roche says. She advises Mr Miliband to make a positive, progressive case for \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and acknowledge the benefits that migrants bring to Britain.\par \par \uc2 Opinion polls suggest that at the European elections next month, Labour and Ukip will fight it out for first place.\par \par \uc2 The continuing surge of Ukip in the polls and Mr Farage's overwhelming triumph in the recent debates forced \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  to mention Mr Farage by name for the first time in a major speech when he addressed the Conservative spring forum last week. Yet, as Ms Roche points out, Mr Miliband has failed to attack Mr Farage or his party directly : "When it comes to the central contest between the two parties that most polls have in first and second place - Labour and Ukip - Labour has been wholly absent.\par \par \uc2 "In March, Ed Miliband mounted his biggest intervention to date on Europe, yet avoided any mention of Labour's closest challenger. It's as if Nigel Farage has become Labour's Voldemort - he whose name cannot be mentioned. The reason is simple: \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\u8230\'20\'26 Battles don't win themselves; they require politicians prepared to fight for what they believe in."\par \par \uc2 Last week, Yvette Cooper, Labour's home affairs spokesperson, made a speech on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , but Ms Roche said it was "convoluted" and failed to acknowledge that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  put more into Britain's economy than they take out - a net contribution of more than 4p on the basic rate of income tax.\par \par \uc2 A ComRes poll for the IoS last week put Ukip on 20 per cent, their highest rating in terms of a general election prediction.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOS00020140420ea4k0002s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw337\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5055\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Court closures spark fears of 'deserts of justice'\b0\par\par\uc2 By Mark Leftly   \par \uc2 719 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 April 2014\par \uc2 Independent On Sunday\par \uc2 INDOS\par \uc2 2ND\par 2,3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 News | Selling buildings is said to be funding modernisation, but some may have gone for as little as \u163\'00\'A31\par \par \uc2 Dozens of the 500 courts in England and Wales are to be shut down under a \u163\'00\'A375m-a-year Ministry of Justice reform programme, fuelling fears that rural areas will become "deserts" of justice.\par \par \uc2 When he announced an estate "modernisation" last month, the Secretary of State for Justice, Chris Grayling, focused on how the money would be invested in refurbishing courts and improving the technology used within them. He said these moves would save the Government more than \u163\'00\'A3100m a year by 2020.\par \par \uc2 However, senior officials have privately confirmed that the only way of making such substantial savings is by shutting more courts. One Ministry of Justice source said: "How else could you do it?"\par \par \uc2 These closures come on top of plans from 2010, when the Ministry revealed it would shut one in four of the 650 magistrates' and county courts in England and Wales. This has been a troubled programme that saw around 100 courts still standing empty last year after the department failed to sell them in a depressed property market.\par \par \uc2 Campaigners fear the closures could result in more valuable court buildings being left unused, with running costs picked up by the taxpayer. The latest available data from last summer shows that 35 buildings have been sold for \u163\'00\'A314.5m to business including care homes and veterinary practices. There are reports that some fetched only \u163\'00\'A31.\par \par \uc2 Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan said last night: "The evidence from their last closure round was that dozens of courts remained unsold for years, costing millions, even though they were sat empty.\par \par \uc2 "In many rural areas we need to make sure people are still able to get to courts. The Government's cuts to legal aid have led to advice deserts, and the closure of courts has led to justice deserts. These further closures risk making it all the more difficult for victims, witnesses, claimants and defendants to attend courts and get justice."\par \par \uc2 Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, admitted recently to the House of Commons' Justice Select Committee, that there would have to be more efficient use of the court estate to generate savings. He cited an example in Newport, South Wales, where there are separate buildings for county, magistrates' and crown courts, and for \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  tribunals.\par \par \uc2 He said: "We have the opportunity now, with technology, of being able to deliver justice much more in the way that we might have done 40 or 50 years ago, which is in smaller, non-purpose-built buildings, but linked with modern technology."\par \par \uc2 His evidence also revealed that the court system's computer technology is archaic: "When you get to the courts you will see that there are some systems that operate without a mouse. That is not because they are modern, but because they were in place before the mouse came along."\par \par \uc2 Penelope Gibbs, director of the charity Transform Justice, said that she was in favour of Lord Thomas's suggestion of holding magistrates' hearings in local venues that are not courts, such as council chambers and community centres, should closures go ahead.\par \par \uc2 But she warned: "The announcement by the MoJ and the words of the Lord Chief Justice both suggest that more court closures are on the cards. It makes sense to consolidate court buildings in city centres, but the closure of more magistrates' courts in rural areas will threaten local justice."\par \par \uc2 Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, argued that an over-reliance on technology could prevent hearings taking place in person. She said: "While it's important to improve the IT systems so parts of the justice system can communicate effectively, it's unwise to cut out opportunities for face-to-face meetings, in particular for people to give evidence in court."\par \par \uc2 Courts minister Shailesh Vara said: "The new programme of investment will make sure that the right money is spent in the right locations, helping to deliver value for money and the most efficient use of our court system."\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, the MoJ revealed that some of the \u163\'00\'A375m will be spent on technology that would let police officers digitally record evidence at crime scenes.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOS00020140420ea4k0001v\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 GPs meeting in York to discuss four-week wait to see doctor\b0\par\par\uc2 By Lucy Johnston   \par \uc2 438 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 April 2014\par 02:19\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 DOCTORS\u8217\'20\'19 leaders are holding a summit to discuss migrant patients, as new figures show family doctors are stretched to breaking point.\par \par \uc2 A poll of more than 2,300 Britons has revealed family doctors are becoming a thing of the past as many wait four weeks for an appointment.\par \par \uc2 It comes as official figures reveal GP surgeries in England have hit an all-time low, with 7,900 surgeries serving 56,000 patients.\par \par \uc2 In 2004, 8,833 surgeries served 52,700 patients.\par \par \uc2 This means people are increasingly relying on overstretched A&E services, two thirds of which missed waiting time targets this winter.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, surgeries are spending \u163\'00\'A35,000 to \u163\'00\'A320,000 a year on locums, according to Pulse magazine.\par \par \uc2 Dr Peter Graves, who represents GPs in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, will raise the issue at a meeting of GP leaders in York next month.\par \par \uc2 It will focus on pressures, including \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , facing GPs and call on the Government to take action.\par \par \uc2 Dr Graves said: \u8220\'20\'1CPeople legally migrate to Britain for a better life. This is not about that decision. It is about the failure of successive governments to plan in response to the growing population.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn hard-pressed areas, doctors could have up to 100 extra patients from legal migrant workers.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But GPs are also concerned about illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and asylum seekers who come here to get health services.\par \par \uc2 There are no reliable figures, but doctors in parts of London and other cities say it is widespread.\par \par \uc2 Dr Graves added: \u8220\'20\'1CThose of us who pay our taxes do not expect to see precious \uc2 NHS\uc2  resources abused by people coming from abroad.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Government needs to take action to ensure GPs should not have to police the abuse of the \uc2 NHS\uc2  by such visitors.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 His comments come as a new poll found just four per cent see their doctor every time they attend their surgery and 72 per cent no longer bother to ask for an appointment with their own GP.\par \par \uc2 Peter Savage, of Medical Accident Group, which carried out the poll, said: \u8220\'20\'1CHaving a different doctor each time does not allow for a deeper understanding of medical issues. It can be easy to miss something.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 It is estimated nearly four million foreigners were allowed into Britain under Labour from 1998 to 2010, while a million Britons quit the country.\par \par \uc2 NHS\uc2  England said: \u8220\'20\'1CDoctors are working extremely hard, even with a 20 per cent increase in GPs over the past decade. It is time to take a fresh look at how services are organised.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140420ea4k000b7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Reviews\par \b \uc2 Book review: The Museum of Ordinary Things By Alice Hoffman\b0\par\par\uc2 Lesley McDowell   \par \uc2 488 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 April 2014\par 01:00\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Alice Hoffman has specialised in stories with a surreal tinge, a gentle element of Angela Carter in her worlds of angels, magic and strange-looking women. She has the power to move the reader to tears; novels such as Skylight Confessions and The Ice Queen are relatively short but are beguiling and moving tales of loss and grief.\par \par \uc2 Where her novels work less successfully is on a large canvas; The Dovekeepers or The Third Angel move through time and generations and, in doing so, somehow let slip the magic that proves so spellbinding in the smaller works. With this novel, Hoffman again turns to history, to tell the story of Eddie Cohen, a Ukrainian Jewish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  to New York at the beginning of the 20th century, and Coralie, who works in her father\u8217\'20\'19s freak show as a mermaid.\par \par \uc2 Coralie is in the same vein of many Hoffman heroines: physically different (she has webbed hands), unconventionally beautiful, sensitive to the dark, and lonely. Eddie is a disenchanted young man who has cast off both his father and his father\u8217\'20\'19s religion, to become apprenticed to a photographer. He witnesses fires in the garment factories of the Lower East Side; he conducts a vendetta against the rich factory owners who exploited both him and his father when they first arrived in New York. Meanwhile, Coralie\u8217\'20\'19s father\u8217\'20\'19s business is losing money and he starts to press his daughter into ever more dangerous feats, including swimming the Hudson at night, until finally he offers her up as a kind of underwater sex show.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Hoffman is best when she takes a moment in history and approaches it from an angle, as she did in Blackbird House. Here, she tries to tell the story of \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  Jews to New York, the union labour movement, the developing art of photography, Coney Island in the early 20th century. It makes for some heavy-handed writing with details that often sound lifted from history or literature guides (\u8220\'20\'1CThis kind man brought... The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair, considered radical for its exposure of the wretched conditions of the meat-packing industry\u8221\'20\'1D; \u8220\'20\'1CSurely it could not compare to Mrs. Vanderbilt\u8217\'20\'19s block-long monstrosity of red bricks and limestone, built in 1882 across from the Plaza Hotel, inspired by a chateau in the Loire Valley\u8221\'20\'1D). There are repetitions and explanations of motives, when they would be better left for the reader to come to in his or her own time.\par \par \uc2 The narrative is assisted by first-person accounts from Coralie and Eddie, written in italics. That central narrative breaks up the intensity of two very personal stories, but official information is contained in all three, and the voices between Eddie and Coralie aren\u8217\'20\'19t terribly different.\par \par \uc2 This is not one of Hoffman\u8217\'20\'19s best, playing rather to her weaknesses than her considerable strengths.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140420ea4k0003r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer Review Features Pages\par \b \uc2 town: COVER STORY: Talk: of the: Last month's live debate between Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage was a coup for LBC, the London talk-radio station that has just gone national. It sees itself as an antidote to an elitist BBC, with its presenters free to be as opinionated as they like. A vigorous, emotional conversation ensues. Is this why so many of us are tuning in?: 'For every call that saps my will to live another restores it'\b0\par\par\uc2 BY RACHEL COOKE PHOTOGRAPH BY KATHERINE ROSE   \par \uc2 4,099 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 April 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Nick Ferrari, the presenter of the LBC breakfast show, makes for a somewhat alarming prospect first thing in the morning, his hail-fellow-well-met manners and his pugilistic confidence coming at you like a triple espresso with too much sugar in it, whether you happen to be listening at home or in the station itself, as I am today. At home, however, you can only imagine what the king of the talk radio jungle must look like when he's in full flight. I'd pictured a red face and an air of deep must-do-my-best concentration, but observing him now from the other side of the glass that separates him from his producers, I'm struck by his studied macho nonchalance: hands behind his head, elbows flapping, belly out and proud. If he had a pint and a fag on the go, you'd hardly be surprised. It makes for an oddly old-fashioned sight given that, in radio circles, 53-year-old Ferrari is currently the man of the moment.\par \par \uc2 Ferrari is on a high, still coming down from the first of the debates between Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage, the leader of Ukip, which LBC staged on 26 March and he moderated. Opinions vary as to who exactly won this somewhat hammy altercation; it may be, the commentators insist, that Clegg is playing a long game and Farage's bloodying of his nose will work in the deputy prime minister's favour at some point in the future. But on one thing most are agreed: this was a win both for LBC, whose patriotic red, white and blue branding could be seen all over the 10 o'clock television news programmes, and for Ferrari, who acquitted himself brilliantly given that he has so much less television experience than David Dimbleby, the chair of the second debate. Today, moreover, Ferrari has been nominated for a whole clutch of Radio Academy (formerly \uc2 Sony\uc2 ) awards. Call Nick Clegg, the half-hour phone-in he hosts with the deputy prime minister each Thursday, is on the shortlist for best speech programme and best news and current affairs programme, while he is on the shortlist in his own right for speech radio personality of the year and for presenting the breakfast show of the year. No wonder he's inclined to tell anyone who will listen that "apart from being a dad, this is the greatest bloody job in the world".\par \par \uc2 I've been at LBC for less than half an hour, but already I'm getting the hang of how the station works. It is 8.40am, which means there are 20 minutes to go until Boris Johnson arrives (the mayor of London joins Ferrari for Ask Boris, a half-hour phone-in, once a month). In the meantime, Ferrari is discussing a news story about a Christian preacher who was arrested and kept in a cell for 19 hours by police in Manchester following a complaint made against him by two gay men (he has since received compensation). This is going well. Ferrari has "a full switchboard", which means he will be required neither to fill the airtime himself, nor change tack and embark on another topic altogether. A full switchboard is the holy grail at LBC. Metaphorically speaking, it is the job of its presenters to throw an issue hard against the wall, in the manner of a custard pie. Splat! If it sticks - if the listeners like the subject and run with it - all is well. If, however, it slides tragically to the ground - if the phones stay silent - then, nothing doing. Time to move on. Useful last resorts in this eventuality include potholes, parking and the veil.\par \par \uc2 As the hour approaches, Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, comes on to decry the privatisation of the \uc2 Royal Mail\uc2 . Ferrari looks sceptical, disdain pushing his forehead into a frown, but uses the moment to throw out a quiz question: Vince Cable is now the longest serving business secretary since. . . who? (Answer: Patricia Hewitt.) This takes him to the news, which is to be delayed slightly in order to accommodate Johnson, who is only now arriving. "He's here!" says the producer. "He's walking through the lobby!" When the mayor reaches the studio, Ferrari rises from his seat, and salutes him. I mean literally salutes him, as if he were a subaltern and Johnson his commanding officer. Crikey. This is chummy. It's also a touch daring, for the clock is ticking, and there are now just seconds to go before the red light comes back on. Johnson needs to get his bum into his seat and his headphones on his bonce. Will he do it? Of course he will. Flying by the seat of his considerable pants is all part of the act. "This is Boris Johnson," he says, the usual laugh in his voice. "This is your chance to put any question you like to me, and I will do my best to answer it with the help of my trusty helpmeet, Mr Nick Ferrari." Having never tuned in to Ask Boris, I'm amazed to see that he deals with the (full) switchboard himself. "We're going to go straight away to the first call," he booms. "It's Gary in Dartford."\par \par \uc2 You couldn't spoof what follows. Gary begins by talking about the debate, saying that it was so one-sided if it had been a football match, it would surely have been called off at half time. "Are you referring to the epic contest that was refereed by my distinguished confrere here, Mr Nick Ferrari?" asks Johnson. Gary says that he is, and that he thought the "refereeing was fantastic, actually" - to which Johnson replies: "He [Ferrari] is preening himself." And so it goes on. Johnson fields calls on whether he is about to try to become an MP again, on pollution, on the state of the Metropolitan police and on the number of power points available to those with electric cars (to this, he talks bafflingly of a putative electric car-sharing scheme that will involve "beautiful little milk crates"). The climax is theatrical, and comes in the form of a call from Sandra, a member of a group that would like to build a memorial to the 1943 Bethnal Green tube disaster, in which 173 people died in the crush as they tried to take shelter during the blitz. She first called Johnson last month, asking for a donation. Now she's back, and the mayor is able to tell her the happy news that Transport for London has miraculously found pounds 10,000 for her campaign - thus proving, as Ferrari puts it, that he is a "man of his word".\par \par \uc2 Ferrari's colleagues talk of his relationship with Johnson as a "bromance". But this doesn't quite capture it. They sound to me more like the pair of privately-educated schoolboys they once were, the less posh of the two (Ferrari, who went to Eltham College) trying his best to put on a good show in front of the other (Johnson, as all the world knows, went to Eton). I find this irritating. But what do I know? Ferrari is the host of London's No 1 commercial breakfast show. At LBC, meanwhile, all the talk is of growth. In the capital, the station has a greater market share than its nearest rival, BBC 5 Live (5.6% to 4.3%). In the past five years, LBC has grown its reach by 67% to 5 Live's 7%, and its audience spends longer each week listening to it (10.9 hours compared with 6.7 for 5 Live). These listeners are also - this may surprise you - well-heeled and educated: 61% of the LBC audience is ABC1. No wonder, then, that its bosses are in the business of expansion: on 11 February, LBC, previously a London-only FM station, went national on the DAB network. Its audience (1.3m across Britain at present) is now set to grow exponentially. The challenge will be keeping its London listeners happy without cheesing off those who live elsewhere, though no one at LBC seems to be remotely fazed by this. "I believe speech radio will grow and grow," says James Rea, LBC's managing editor. He attributes its current success to its listeners, who shape its output to an extraordinary degree; to its presenters, who are encouraged to have opinions and "let the wall down" on their own lives; and to its lean structure, which allows it to be vastly more flexible than the BBC, so bureaucratic and so top-heavy. "There's a short chain of command and no agonised editorial meeting about what to drop and how to react," says Rea. "We're ready, we're right here, and we're right now."\par \par \uc2 After Johnson disappears, bicycle helmet in hand, Ferrari does "reaction" to the phone-in: yes, a phone-in about a phone-in. If anything, his mood is now even more buoyant, his amazing front teeth - so big and white and shiny - flashing happily in the gloom of the studio every couple of minutes. Meanwhile, the mid-morning presenter, James O'Brien, has shuffled in. Like Ferrari, who began his career as a tabloid journalist, O'Brien is an ex-newspaper man (the former show-business editor of the Daily Express) and he, too, has a strangely archaic way of talking, one that belies his age (he is only 42). He will, for instance, ask a male caller what his "good lady wife" feels about this or that issue. But his presentational manner is singular. He sounds - to me, at least - lugubrious, pained, a touch obsessive. He treats his chosen topics like the bones of a Sunday roast, picking off the meat with a thoroughness that can be exhausting. I bumped into him earlier, in the newsroom outside ("WHEN IS JULIAN ASSANGE COMING OUT?" read a pained note scrawled on the office whiteboard), and he'd complained to me that it was a slow day, the major story in the papers being about how many vegetables we should all eat. On the other hand, he also admitted to liking mornings like this: "You drink lots of coffee, read all the papers, see what happens when the red light comes on. . ."\par \par \uc2 In the end, O'Brien kicks off with betting shops: why, he wants to know, are the poor more likely to spend their money at the bookies? I can't tell whether the air of mystification in his voice is a put-on, but either way, his preamble, punctuated as it is with various red rags - "The poor are different from you and me," he says, at one point - does the trick. The switchboard lights up, and he's off. Some of the calls are moving, one man sounding close to breaking down as he describes his wife's debts, the result of what began as a fondness for internet bingo, and it isn't long before O'Brien is telling his audience sombrely that he is "struggling to hang on to his libertarian credo" so far as betting machines go (callers have identified these as a particular problem). But he sounds pleased, too. LBC presenters make a great show of relishing the idea that the audience has helped them to change their mind. It's a way of underlining to sneery types who assume LBC is just for angry cabbies how articulate their listeners are, and how very knowledgeable.\par \par \uc2 After the three-hour show is over, O'Brien and I talk. How was it for him? "I'm pleased," he says. "It couldn't have gone much better. We got deep understanding from callers: testimony rather than opinion." He looks knackered, though. Is it tiring, being on the receiving end of so much anger, frustration and sadness? It would make me depressed. "Well, if you ask the right question, you shouldn't get bludgeons coming on," he says. "But even when I do, I'm interested in why they're angry." Has working at LBC - he has been with the station for 10 years - made him more positive or more negative when it comes to the public? "I'm loth to answer that. For every call that saps my will to live, I'll get another one that restores it. The invitation to punch out has been made worryingly irresistible to ordinary, decent people: [think of] the effort that is put in daily to make people blame \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  or the unemployed for their personal ills. When things get better [economically speaking], it will be easier for them to resist. But what puzzles and fascinates me is why people punch down rather than up."\par \par \uc2 O'Brien loves the fact that LBC is editorialised like a newspaper; not for him the neutrality of the BBC. "I can talk about what I think and what I know and what I've been through. I can talk about being adopted, having fertility treatment, being in trouble when I was younger." This has a knock-on effect on his audience. "People trust you. One listener decided to call off the 'honour killing' of his daughter, live, on air. Another time, we were talking about allegations of historical sex abuse, asking why people wait so long to come forward. This very tough-sounding fellow rang in and started howling in primal pain. It's not that complicated. It's just company. Everybody likes company, and, if you haven't got the BBC in your blood, you won't have been brainwashed into thinking that impartial company is better than un-impartial company. Imagine you were at a party or a pub and everybody was trying to qualify everything all the time. Actually, impartial company is just weird."\par \par \uc2 Once upon a time, LBC stood for London Broadcasting Company. Since 2007, however, it has stood for Leading Britain's Conversation - quite a natty bit of rebranding on the part of its marketeers. London's first legal, independent commercial radio station, it launched in 1973 with a roster of presenters and reporters many of whom went on to become well known: Janet Street-Porter, Jon Snow, Jeremy Beadle, Peter Allen (now of 5 Live). Over the years, it has had a series of owners - it almost disappeared in 1993, when the Radio Authority failed to renew its licence - but is now in the hands of Global Radio and broadcasts from the offices in Leicester Square that also house the company's other stations: Capital, \uc2 Classic FM\uc2 , XFM, Heart, Gold and Smooth. It's a convivial place to work - the building has what must surely be Britain's best staff canteen in the form of a roof terrace with views out over the Houses of Parliament, Trafalgar Square, the London Eye and the Shard - though there seems to be an awful lot of hot-desking going on, its staff, most of whom look very young, wandering about with their laptops under their arms.\par \par \uc2 The current incarnation of LBC has a clear bias to the right, for all that James O'Brien insists to me that he is a liberal. It's true that Ken Livingstone co-hosts a Saturday morning show, but among its other high-profile presenters are David Mellor, the former Conservative politician (also Saturday morning); Andrew Pierce, the Daily Mail columnist; and Iain Dale, a publisher who before landing his job at LBC tried and failed to be selected to fight a Conservative parliamentary seat. Women are thin on the ground. Kay Burley, the Sky newsreader, has recently begun co-presenting a Sunday breakfast show. But the only five-day-a-week woman - she does the afternoon show - is Julia Hartley-Brewer, who came to LBC three years ago after leaving the Sunday Express, where she was the political editor.\par \par \uc2 Is this butch, right-of-centre tone the secret of its current success? The staff insist not, and baulk at comparisons to the US, land of Fox and the shock jock. "I think we need to be clear," says James Rea. "The appetite [in the UK] is not for shock jocks." Hartley-Brewer thinks it has more to do with the end of deference more generally. "The stranglehold of Radio 4 is beginning to break, especially with younger listeners," she says, an enormous smile on her face. "The insulting idea that we know better than you: that's over, and listeners are driving that. They won't allow the entire conversation to be controlled by self-appointed so-called experts. They won't go along with the idea that a teacher doesn't know as much as the education secretary." Isn't it wearing, though, dealing with this particular form of democracy? Many newspaper writers feel ground down by all the interactivity involved in 21st-century journalism. "I've heard this a lot, generally from Radio 4 listeners. There's this snobbery: oh, you can't ask ordinary people what they think because they're all stupid. But you know what? They're not. I do sometimes finish shows absolutely exhausted. But I'm just pleased to have a job that's fun every day. I could be in a factory taking giblets out of a chicken." She gives me a look. "You see, I don't hold my listeners in contempt." Well, I don't hold my readers in contempt. "Yes, you do!" she shouts.\par \par \uc2 Talk to the presenters, and they'll all tell you the same. First, that they're amazed by how many first-time callers they speak to (LBC makes a point of identifying first-time callers). Second, that they're often on the receiving end of information the caller has never revealed to anyone else. Don't they find this weird? "It is weird," says Hartley-Brewer. "They don't know me, but they think they do. I'd love to know why [they do it]. But it's an art, not a science. Radio is something you do on your own: in the car, in the bedroom late at night. It's one on one, it's personal. They trust you, it's a safe place to talk." The presenters I meet are a preternaturally smiley bunch - they've drunk the LBC Kool-Aid - but their emotions, rather like those of their listeners, are close to the surface. Hartley-Brewer tells me about a phone-in in which she revealed she has suffered four miscarriages: "It took everything I had to keep it together for that hour. The entire office was in tears." Iain Dale gets choked up twice: first, as he describes the call he took from a witness to the murder of Lee Rigby in Woolwich last year, and then as he tells me about a man who rang from the M25 threatening to kill himself. "I've got no training in this," he says. "I was aware not only that I could lose my job, but that he could kill himself and people would blame me." Once he's mastered the wobble in the voice, he adds: "Any presenter who doesn't care should go and do something else!"\par \par \uc2 All this is very far from the cynicism I was expecting. I had foreseen exploitation of the audience not identification with it. And herein, I think, lies the real reason LBC's ratings are rising. It may well be true that some people are tired of the BBC. It may also be the case that certain sections of the public are delighted to have found a repository for their frustration with the 21st century: a refuge from received opinion, from political correctness, from the cant and dishonesty of public life (LBC and Ukip are both benefiting on this score). Doesn't everyone like a good moan sometimes? But perhaps it's really down to these presenters, fervent as evangelists. They run a kind of radio confession box, and this involves a certain kind of devotion, one they seem to have in spades. "I wish I could have done this 10 years ago," says Dale, as I get up to go. "I'm doing the job I was put on this earth to do." His face is suffused with something quite beyond mere job satisfaction.\par \par \uc2 Two days later, I return to LBC to watch Ferrari at work with Nick Clegg, the man he has to thank for giving his profile such an extraordinary boost. His relationship with the deputy prime minister is less obviously matey than the one he has with Boris Johnson, and I find the show more enjoyable. Clegg is also, it must be said, charming. It seems that the impetus for the show came as much from Clegg as from LBC - the deputy prime minister knew mayor Bloomberg had done a similar programme in New York - and he is clearly determined to prove that his decision to get involved was the right one.\par \par \uc2 After the programme is over, Ferrari and I repair to the LBC boardroom. He tells me that he's in a rush; I will have only 10 minutes or so of his time. But in the end, of course, he can't resist the temptation to talk. "I get to tell everyone what I think about the world," he tells me, when I ask why he enjoys his job. "Some people do this on the bus, and they get taken to hospital and put in a secure unit. But I do it, and they put me in a studio and pay me a lot of money." What about other people's opinions? Does he really like hearing those at seven o'clock in the morning? "Yes, I genuinely do like the public." The debate between Clegg and Farage has encouraged him on this score. "By and large, if you went into a pub [before] and said: 'I want to talk about Europe,' you'd have been killed in the stampede to get out. But we've shown that, if you do it in an appealing way, people will engage. It's like the Sun, with the added bonus that people ring in. Politicians know this. When I meet them, the first thing they ask is: what are people calling about?" Ferrari, too, relishes the personal stories people tell him. "We were discussing the Holocaust, and whether we should remember it. A heavily accented woman rang in and said, 'I was at Auschwitz as a 14-year-old.' My God, I said, what was that like for you? 'It was terrible,' she said. I asked her how she explained that to her family, and she said she'd never told anyone before. 'I just think I can trust you,' she said."\par \par \uc2 How does Ferrari see the future? "This is the best chance speech radio has ever had in this country." Can the station really be as successful across Britain as it is in London? He believes it can, and without losing its heartland in the process. "\uc2 Harvey Nichols\uc2  opened in Leeds, but that didn't make the London store any less great, did it? LBC has a clear identity. It knows where it's going. It's well funded. This is an extraordinary moment in its 40-year life, and if you can't enjoy it now, it's best you clear off. [I think he's referring to his fellow presenters rather than to me.] The stranglehold of the BBC is being broken. We're here for you, whether it's a great day, or a dark day."\par \par \uc2 Continued on page 10\par \par \uc2 Continued from page 8\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 'Flying by the seat of his considerable pants': London mayor Boris Johnson live on air.\par \par \uc2 'Pugilistic confidence': LBC's Nick Ferrari, far left, hosting the debate last month on membership of the EU between Ukip leader Nigel Farage, centre, and Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister.

\par\par \uc2 Observer Home News Pages\par \b \uc2 Q: So where's the hub of Venice's independence party? A: Kent: From his Tonbridge study, a psychiatrist hopes to rally global support for Europe's latest separatist group. Harriet Sherwood reports\b0\par\par\uc2 1,012 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 April 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The pound shops and fast-food outlets of Tonbridge, Kent, seem an unlikely setting for the international hub of the Venetian independence movement. But overlooking the opaque brown waters of the river Medway, some 700 miles from the sweeping palazzo-flanked Grand Canal, is the "Republic of Venice Embassy", headed - and staffed solely - by Giovanni Dalla-Valle, a voluble Italian-born psychiatrist who is utterly convinced that small, local, independent states will be the hallmark of 21st-century Europe in a "new Renaissance".\par \par \uc2 Ambassador Dalla-Valle left the north Italian region of Veneto as a disillusioned young doctor 22 years ago. Now, from the first-floor study of his modest townhouse and amid red-and-gold Venetian flags bearing the Lion of St Mark, he runs an international campaign for its independence. The coming years, he says, will see "a move from economic totalitarianism to localised models of economics, welfare, culture and ethics. The geopolitical map of the 21st century will be much smaller nation states based on self-determination."\par \par \uc2 In Veneto, he says, the movement has been galvanised by "recession, euro crisis, austerity measures and excessive taxation". The impact on a region which, he says, contributes euros 70bn (pounds 57bn) a year to Italy's budget but receives only euros 50bn in services, has been "a profound crisis", with the closure of up to 30 small businesses a day, the loss of 100,000 jobs and a significant spike in the suicide rate. Free from Rome, Veneto - whose per capita GDP is, say separatists, 15% higher than the national figure - has the potential to be a "small but economic superpower", insists Dalla-Valle. Antipathy to Rome and the desire for local autonomy produced an 89% vote in favour of Veneto becoming a "independent and sovereign federal republic" in an online poll organised last month by the pro-independence organisation, Plebiscito.\par \par \uc2 An independent Venice would not be new; it was a cultural and commercial republic for more than 1,000 years before being seized by France in 1797, then governed by Austria, and finally coming under Rome's rule in 1866.\par \par \uc2 Thirty-five years ago, a separatist movement emerged and later came under the umbrella of the rightwing Lega Nord (Northern League). Dalla-Valle is anxious to distance himself and Plebiscito from the League's "xenophobic, stuck-in-the-past, pre-globalisation" political philosophy. "We do not want to return to the Veneto of 200 years ago; we want the issues of today resolved."\par \par \uc2 He points to narrow majorities in last month's poll in favour of remaining part of the EU and the eurozone as evidence that the movement is shedding the rightwing cloak thrown over it by the Northern League. \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  - who make up around 10% of the population of five million - would be welcomed in the independent Republic of Venice. "It's so beautiful to hear black and Chinese children speaking Venetian," Dalla-Valle says, referring to the local dialect spoken by an estimated 70% in the region.\par \par \uc2 Dalla-Valle, who describes himself as leftwing and whose socio-economic priorities are raising low wages and pensions, looks for inspiration to Scotland's independence movement.\par \par \uc2 "The Scots are a model, a lighthouse to separatist movements in Europe - open, tolerant, social democratic," he says. "They want to take decision-making on solid economic issues back to local communities."\par \par \uc2 The ambassador gets out a photograph of Venetian activists marching through Edinburgh in support of their Scottish counterparts last year, red-and-gold flags alongside the saltire.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for Venetian autonomy have been ridiculed by the national government and marginalised by the media. The online poll was dismissed by politicians and academics as unconstitutional, invalid and unverifiable. Dalla-Valle says it was based on a rigorous electronic voting system that automatically discarded the votes of the ineligible and nullified repeat voting: "It's very difficult to corrupt an e-poll compared to a paper poll." Sixty-five per cent of eligible voters took part, with 2,102,969 yes votes cast.\par \par \uc2 Arianna Giovanni, a researcher in Italian politics at \uc2 Leeds Metropolitan University\uc2 , questions the veracity of polling methods and the data, but says the referendum broadly reflects Venetian exasperation. Other, more credible, surveys have suggested a majority of around 55% in support of independence. "Fractures in the socio-economic and political arenas are particularly evident in Veneto at the moment," she says. "The independence movement should be taken seriously - not because people really want to secede, but as a cry for attention based on a profound sense of dissatisfaction. It's a warning to the Italian political class."\par \par \uc2 In the unlikely event it wins independence, the traditionally centre-right stronghold of Veneto may not embrace Dalla-Valle's vision of a liberal nation-state. But that does not deter this man who spent 20 years working in the mental health sector of the \uc2 NHS\uc2 . Two years ago, Dalla-Valle - born in Bassano del Grappa, home to the liqueur, to an ancient Venetian family - cut his work commitments to a minimum and sold some property to devote around 50 hours a week to his cause.\par \par \uc2 His most recent efforts focused on securing the release of 24 activists arrested in St Mark's Square on 2 April, accused of plotting a violent takeover. "The Italian government is ferocious against anyone who tries to challenge unity," says Dalla-Valle. Most were discharged from custody on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Despite having relinquished Italian citizenship, Dalla-Valle has made 35 trips to Veneto since March 2012 "to help my people". His permanent return awaits independence. "It will happen, we will see it," he insists. Until then, the ambassador's gaze will rest on the Medway rather than the Grand Canal.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Giovanni Dalla-Valle, pictured with the flag of Veneto, is encouraged by\par \par \uc2 a recent poll backing independence.

\par\par \uc2 Observer New Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 Beware the fake patriots' anger on \uc2 immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 Nick Cohen   \par \uc2 1,105 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 April 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 43\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 No cause is as dead as the campaign to provide an amnesty for illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . Far-sighted politicians once found it intolerable that criminals could abuse and exploit the half a million among us who were living beyond the minimum wage, the tax system and the rule of law.\par \par \uc2 The recession killed their humane concern. The church-led movement to turn "strangers into citizens" hardly exists now. Only in unvisited web archives can you find its arguments that we should admit people who could prove that they were honest and hardworking into mainstream society. George Osborne, a politician for whom the phrase "You could carve a better man out of a banana" might have been coined, will damn Boris Johnson by quoting his courageous support for an amnesty when they face each other in the next Tory leadership election. Conservative propagandists have found that the weapon has a satisfyingly devastating effect. They used Nick Clegg's support for an amnesty to puncture the Liberal Democrat bubble in the 2010 general election campaign.\par \par \uc2 Rather than give rights to people who have been here for years, living in slums and paying no income tax, everyone who reads the polls and the papers agrees that "soft-touch" Britain needs to butch up. There must be crackdowns and purges; night arrests and dawn deportations. Opposition has fallen as the cost of living crisis has grown. Labour is terrified the electorate will see it as weak. The BBC confesses its liberal line on \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  was biased, when many of us would have said that was the smallest of its prejudices. Everywhere, hard-faced men and hatchet-faced women are triumphant, even though their policies are failing in front of our eyes.\par \par \uc2 Last week, Labour discovered that Home Office appeals for the public to inform on illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  had resulted in 4,535 arrests and 1,585 deportations. If you think these figures are low, you would be right. \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  officers tell me that only a third of the arrests led to deportations because denunciations of illegals are notoriously unreliable. People report a new neighbour because he has a black face. The owner of an Indian restaurant reports the Chinese restaurant over the road to hurt the competition and the owner of the Chinese restaurant returns the dirty trick a few months later.\par \par \uc2 As telling are the 4,535 arrests. According to the best recent estimate of the size of Britain's underground world, the number of illegal entrants, refused asylum seekers, and tourists and students who have overstayed their visas lies between 410,000 and 860,000. The current rate of expulsion is 14,000 enforced and 28,000 voluntary removals a year. It would take a decade - maybe much longer - to remove them all. Even assuming that no one else comes, which they will.\par \par \uc2 Ineffective though it may be, asking the public to play the informer makes the home secretary and Conservative party look as though they are in control in a political world where looks are all that matter. As if to prove the point, Theresa May has turned \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  enforcement officers into props in the Tories re-election campaign: a visible rather than an effective force; more ornament than use.\par \par \uc2 She makes them travel in vans with a striking turquoise and navy blue chequer pattern along their side. Above it, in bold letters no one can miss, runs the logo "\b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Enforcement". The sight may convince voters to stay with the Tories rather than vote Ukip. But, as Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Service Union, tells me, branded vans are no help in catching illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . As soon as her members announce their presence by driving to the front doors of sink estates, illegals nip out the back. Not that their superiors care. All methods, however facile or devious, are acceptable if they allow the Home Office to pretend that it is assuaging public anger. Moreton says it is common practice for officers to tour airport departure lounges, find \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who are leaving Britain anyway and serve them with deportation notices just before their flights take off. The managers and politicians are happy and approve. With one trick - eureka! - the targets are met.\par \par \uc2 It is a little too easy, however, to pretend that nothing has changed. The phoney war cannot go on for ever. If fear and outrage make it impossible to offer a proportion of illegals a path towards respectable lives, the state will reach for nastier options. My guess is that, in order to save British culture from foreigners, our rightwing patriots will undermine it by instituting a system of identity controls.\par \par \uc2 May is heading in that direction. Already, employers must check the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  status of applicants before hiring them. She will make landlords and \uc2 NHS\uc2  receptionists do the same. In theory, this sounds a ferocious deterrent. Who wants to come to a country where they cannot work, rent a home or receive medical treatment? In practice, it is another stunt from the publicity hounds at the Home Office. All kinds of foreigners have pieces of paper that entitle them to live in Britain. EU nationals, their partners, \uc2 European Economic Area\uc2  nationals, Chinese citizens with work visas, American citizens with student visas. . . There are dozens of valid documents and that's before you get to the forgeries.\par \par \uc2 All hospital administrators and landlords will do is what employers already do: photocopy the patient or tenant's documents and say, if the police question them, that they appeared to be genuine. The only way to turn a stunt into an effective policy is to issue identity cards for everyone in or visiting Britain. Only identity cards can meet the demands of public and press. But in meeting them they will destroy a notion of British freedom, which, call me a sentimentalist, I find worth defending.\par \par \uc2 We are a common-law democracy, with limits of the power of the state. We are not a country where police officers can demand to see your papers or stop and search you without reason. We are not a country where you have to prove you are entitled to treatment before a doctor will help you. The talk-radio hosts' screams and the tantrums of Ukip and the Tories will tear that old country down and create, for all their Euroscepticism, a Britain far closer to a Napoleonic Europe.\par \par \uc2 As they do it, they should remind you that no one does as much damage to a country as the patriots who profess to love it the most.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140419ea4k00019\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Oh, that's novel - a radio station specialising in black music being attacked by an older white male who doesn't listen to it. (The odd lift encounter aside!) In case you missed the headlines, \uc2 Jeremy Paxman\uc2  has been having a go at his employer, the BBC, describing it, among other things, as too big. Specifically, he portrayed his idea of "hell" as "standing in a lift that has Radio 1Xtra plumbed into it". He added that he didn't understand why the BBC "does" the station.\par \par \uc2 I started listening to 1Xtra as soon as it launched in 2002. Marketed as the home of "new black music" in the UK, it demonstrated a cultural shift. Despite the enduring problems of what exactly constitutes "black music", what was understood is that the station aimed to disorientate the mainstream.\par \par \uc2 1Xtra sought to champion music that you might never otherwise have heard of if you were a newcomer to the station or that you knew inside out if you weren't. Music trends such as grime, dubstep, trap and Afrobeats have all been celebrated. One of 1Xtra's smart moves was recruiting talent from within the scenes they now represent. DJs such as Monki, who made her name at pirate station Rinse FM, or DJ Target, who was a member of grime crew Roll Deep, bought with them an alternative world-view alongside their record bags.\par \par \uc2 The station existed to make the simple point that black music infiltrating the pop chart wasn't a one-hit-wonder trend or a commodity to be bought and sold to the listening public before they moved on to the next hot thing. Artists such as Dizzee Rascal and Tinie Tempah weren't representing the end point of young black artists getting number ones, they were the beginning.\par \par \uc2 Essentially, if your first-hand experience is a minority one, be it racially or musically, the simple fact is that you're more likely to identify with the need for more minority programming, which, sadly, might be one reason that Paxman doesn't see the point of the station.\par \par \uc2 The BBC might not just need 1xtra for the music, but also the range of minority voices it represents. It normalises the idea that minority experiences exist (from documentaries on black models and \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  detainees, or theming a week around "New Africa"). Radio 1's slavish bowing to indie was the reason I, as a young Asian who grew up listening to hip-hop and garage, switched off.\par \par \uc2 Radio 1's often indulgent pandering to the idea that there is one kind of youth experience - a white mainstream one - is what makes it increasingly out of touch. For many suburbanites up and down the UK who have little opportunity to engage with difference outside their front door, radio offers a lifeline.\par \par \uc2 In-jokes about African parents, Jamaican guests bringing in yams for breakfast or nonchalant references to Ramadan on air. . . 1Xtra serves to educate rather than alienate.\par \par \uc2 It has created its own radio culture, and while diversity might fail in other areas of the BBC, here at least it stands up. "Black music", whatever that means, is pop music. But more than that, the station provides a space where minority culture is given room to breathe. That's why we need it.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140419ea4k0000z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NATIONAL NEWS\par \b \uc2 Cameron's attempt to 'do God' faces test of faith by electorate\b0\par\par\uc2 By Helen Warrell, Public Policy Correspondent   \par \uc2 643 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 April 2014\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFT\par \uc2 London Ed1\par 02\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Before the last election, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  said that, although an Anglican, he did not wear his faith on his sleeve. It seemed he had taken heed of a line on religion from Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former communications chief - "we don't do God" - and appeared bashful about discussing his beliefs.\par \par \uc2 So the prime minister's recent comments that Britain should be "more evangelical" about Christianity, that Jesus "invented the Big Society" and that his moments of "greatest peace" were while attending church, prompted speculation about what could have caused the change.\par \par \uc2 But there are plenty of reasons why it might be the right time politically for him to focus on faith.\par \par \uc2 With the election just over a year away, Mr Cameron is the only committed Christian in the running for Downing Street - both Labour's Ed Miliband and the Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg are avowed atheists.\par \par \uc2 Even Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence party, is quiet on the subject of his beliefs, a Christmas and Easter-type Anglican who aides say is "private" about his faith.\par \par \uc2 Not only will being enthusiastically religious allow the PM to appeal to the Christian vote: it might also help repair relations with Church-going Tories antagonised by the legalisation of gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron also needs to find a way of engaging with high-ranking clergy who have attacked his welfare reforms for hurting the poorest in society.\par \par \uc2 Number 10 plays down talk of a change of strategy, with aides pointing out that Mr Cameron delivers an Easter message every year, and that he is the first prime minister to have an annual reception for every major faith during their festivals. Nonetheless, the prime minister's comments have been met with cynicism.\par \par \uc2 Alastair Campbell was scornful. "Unless this is absolutely authentic, people will be turned off by it at every level," he told the Financial Times.\par \par \uc2 "I think in Britain we respect faith, but whenever anyone tries to ally it to politics then people just resent that," Mr Campbell added. "I think in Cameron's case, it's a way of making himself feel better about some of the things he's doing in government."\par \par \uc2 The religious community has also expressed scepticism. In a piece for the Daily Mail, Giles Fraser, the former canon chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral, called it "a pallid imitation of Christianity, the equivalent of empty-gesture politics".\par \par \uc2 Elizabeth Oldfield, director of Theos, a Christian think-tank, also warns that discussion of Anglicanism in these terms - saying it's good for the community, for the Big Society - "doesn't really wash".\par \par \uc2 "There's a bit of a repair job [following gay marriage] being attempted here, but it might not be worth it," she told the FT. "I would be surprised if there's a significant proportion of Christians who will have this in their minds when they decide who to vote for."\par \par \uc2 In fact, Theos research published in January showed that those who identify themselves as Christians prioritise the same issues as the rest of the electorate - such as the economy, or \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - when they come to vote.\par \par \uc2 As a result, it seems unlikely Mr Cameron's more visible religious faith will appeal to the electorate - regardless of his intentions. Peter Kellner, president of pollsters YouGov, dismisses the Tory leader's pre-Easter protestations as "neither here nor there" in vote-winning terms.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think old maids cycling to church every Sunday will be thinking: at last, a prime minister who takes religion seriously," Mr Kellner said. "The question voters will be asking is: does this really mean Cameron is a decent, sincere, moral person, or is he just saying this because he thinks he needs to?"\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020140419ea4j0000a\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 White Christmas for White Dee?

\par\par \uc2 FINANCE\par \b \uc2 Open for business? Prove it\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rebecca Burn-Callander   \par \uc2 1,118 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 April 2014\par 21:00\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Hi-tech British exports are still hobbled by red tape\par \par \uc2 When Kostya Novoselov and Andre Geim developed graphene, the \u8220\'20\'1Cmaterial of tomorrow\u8221\'20\'1D, in 2010, they were using scientific instruments manufactured by London-based Cryogenic.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 1992 by Jeremy Good, the company specialises in precision instruments for physicists dealing with high magnetic fields and low temperatures. The \u163\'00\'A310m-turnover business exports 95pc of its products, and 85pc of its customers are from outside Europe.\par \par \uc2 However, despite the Government\u8217\'20\'19s commitment to increasing net exports to \u163\'00\'A31\u8201\'20\'09 trillion by 2020, Good\u8217\'20\'19s international growth ambitions have been curtailed by form-filling, visa issues and EU bureaucracy.\par \par \uc2 Cryogenic employs 75 people in the UK, a third of whom are scientists and PhDs. The company\u8217\'20\'19s ability to recruit and retain top talent is crucial: without innovation Cryogenic would be unable to keep up with its hi-tech material engineering and research customers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe need the best people from all over the world to come to work for us,\u8221\'20\'1D says Good. \u8220\'20\'1CBut you can\u8217\'20\'19t imagine the trouble we\u8217\'20\'19ve had trying to secure visas for staff.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 It took more than a year to get a visa for a Ukrainian scientist.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe had to pay for him to work for us back in the Ukraine, and he would drop in on flying visits to London while we waited for his visa to be approved,\u8221\'20\'1D explains Good. \u8220\'20\'1CIt was a nightmare.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The issues continued when the time came to renew the visa. Despite the company making the application in good time, the \uc2 UK Border Agency\uc2  office said that only emergency applications were being granted.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTechnically, this meant he ought to leave,\u8221\'20\'1D says Good. \u8220\'20\'1CBut his wife was here, his child was in school. It was very nerve-racking.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Legally, Good had to stop paying the scientist until the new visa had been granted. He sought legal advice and was told that although continuing to employ the scientist was technically an imprisonable offence, no one had ever been prosecuted.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI was incensed that I was breaking the law, but I couldn\u8217\'20\'19t stop paying him just because of bureaucracy.\par \par \uc2 Three weeks later I got the call saying that he could stay, but the whole experience was so demoralising for the guy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Good has lost key staff because of the amount of paperwork required for non-nationals to stay in the UK.\par \par \uc2 A specialist in atomic force microscopy, who had worked at Cambridge University for many years, recently decided to move to Germany. \u8220\'20\'1CHe was just fed up,\u8221\'20\'1D says Good.\par \par \uc2 Cryogenic has not only lost good people because of red tape, but it is also missing out on crucial revenue.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CCustomers want to come and see the equipment before they buy it. We\u8217\'20\'19ve had cases where we\u8217\'20\'19ve had to wait six months for a visa.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s hugely damaging to cash flow to have \u163\'00\'A3250,000 worth of equipment sitting in the factory while we wait for the visa application to go through.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Even once Cryogenic\u8217\'20\'19s customers reach British soil, their experiences with border control can be extremely negative.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COne customer from Japan who is 80 years old was made to stand and wait for four hours. He\u8217\'20\'19d spent \u163\'00\'A31m with us and that\u8217\'20\'19s how he was treated. It was outrageous.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Good claims Cryogenic has lost out on up to 25pc of turnover because of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and visa issues.\par \par \uc2 When visas aren\u8217\'20\'19t granted to customers, Cryogenic has to send a team out to the customer\u8217\'20\'19s country to train scientists on the new equipment, at substantial cost to Cryogenic.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the UK\u8217\'20\'19s science minister, David Willetts, set out the Government\u8217\'20\'19s ambition for British science to be the best in the world, announcing a \u163\'00\'A3300m fund to create jobs in the sector and spur innovation.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CInvestment in science is a crucial part of this Government\u8217\'20\'19s long-term economic plan,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s about investing in our future, helping grow new industries and create more jobs \u8211\'20\'13 and that will mean more financial security for people across the country.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 According to the Government, every \u163\'00\'A31 spent on scientific research in Britain generates 50p for the wider economy every single year afterwards.\par \par \uc2 Cryogenic, as one of only three global companies offering these particular specialised research products, should be a priority for the Government.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut we\u8217\'20\'19ve reached a point that we are considering moving some of our operations elsewhere,\u8221\'20\'1D said Good. \u8220\'20\'1CWe must sell around the world, but red tape is making this very challenging.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 New EU regulation governing procurement has also become a challenge for Cryogenic. \u8220\'20\'1CIf universities in Europe want to buy equipment worth over \u8364\'20\'AC200,000 (\u163\'00\'A3165,000), they have to undertake a bidding procedure,\u8221\'20\'1D he explains.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis can be extremely complicated for smaller companies, involving hundreds of pages of documentation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Cryogenic has to bid for the contracts in the language of the university\u8217\'20\'19s country of origin, which has increased the cost of doing business in Europe.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey want the whole safety policy and the description of the product in the buyer\u8217\'20\'19s language, which means hiring an agent. It\u8217\'20\'19s a nonsense. It\u8217\'20\'19s now far easier for me to sell to Japan or Brazil than to France.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Good\u8217\'20\'19s travails don\u8217\'20\'19t end there. All products that are sold in Europe must have the CE mark, which proves European safety directives have been met.\par \par \uc2 Obtaining the CE mark can be costly. Many companies outside the EU will only invest in CE marking for high-value products.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ve tried to buy hi-tech equipment from the US that cost $10,000,\u8221\'20\'1D says Good. \u8220\'20\'1CBut it was too low value for the company to EC mark, so we couldn\u8217\'20\'19t have it.\par \par \uc2 In Japan, there are companies making state-of-the-art equipment you can\u8217\'20\'19t get anywhere else. The CE rules are effectively a restriction on trade.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Good is calling for a wholesale review of the CE marking process to allow for exceptions. \u8220\'20\'1CThe regulation is supposed to protect EU industry and make it safer, but it\u8217\'20\'19s just holding hi-tech companies back,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 But, for Cryogenic, the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  challenge remains far more pressing. The company is aiming for a \u163\'00\'A312m turnover this year, but if its customers were granted visas in a timely fashion, that figure could be higher.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLet\u8217\'20\'19s make the visa application work for businesses,\u8221\'20\'1D says Good. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s important to protect our borders from abuse, but we don\u8217\'20\'19t have to throw the baby out with the bath water.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Government says the UK is open for business,\u8221\'20\'1D he continues. \u8220\'20\'1CI say, prove it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140419ea4j004sd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Nigel Farage is staring down the barrel of his favourite gun\b0\par\par\uc2 By Matthew d\u8217\'20\'19Ancona   \par \uc2 1,259 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 April 2014\par 19:30\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader is starting to resemble the very politicians he lives to destroy, and his astonishingly easy ride in the media may be coming to an end\par \par \uc2 ''It\u8217\'20\'19s written into the Tory share price,\u8221\'20\'1D according to one Cabinet minister. \u8220\'20\'1CAt least, I hope it is.\u8221\'20\'1D This senior Coalition figure was referring to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Ukip}}}\uc2  \u8217\'20\'19s prospects in the European elections on May 22 and his point was this: the Conservatives have long been expected to finish behind Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party in the contest. Such an outcome will be deeply unpleasant for the Tories but will not affect the outcome of the general election. At least, he hopes not.\par \par \uc2 The latest ICM poll suggests that Ukip is indeed on course to beat \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s party next month: five points clear of the Conservatives and only three behind Labour. You may have read that Ed Miliband has hired David Axelrod, the campaigning genius who steered Barack Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012. It will be intriguing to see what Axelrod makes of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s answer to the \u8220\'20\'1CTea Party\u8221\'20\'1D, and its position in the political firmament. Though Ukip takes votes from all parties, 45 per cent of its supporters backed the Conservatives at the last election. If I were Axelrod, I would be reminded of \uc2 Ross Perot\uc2 , the Independent candidate who took 18.9 per cent of the popular vote in the 1992 presidential race, and helped to deny \uc2 George Bush Sr\uc2  a second term.\par \par \uc2 Farage alone cannot win the general election for Miliband any more than Perot was the sole author of \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s presidency. Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s chances of remaining in Downing Street after May 7 2015, depend upon the speed of the recovery, how palpable it is to voters, the fiscal credibility of Labour (or lack of it), and the capacity of senior Conservatives to persuade a sufficiency of voters that they are more than the political wing of the already affluent.\par \par \uc2 In this kaleidoscopic array of forces, the depth and significance of an \u8220\'20\'1Corganic split\u8221\'20\'1D on the Right \u8211\'20\'13 between Conservatives and Kippers, Cameroons and Farageists \u8211\'20\'13 may be wildly exaggerated. But that is precisely what a digitalised culture does: alongside its many marvels \u8211\'20\'13 which are legion - it seizes upon division, loathing and other pathologies and amplifies them. These are the new rules, and Farage understands them as well as any politician in Britain.\par \par \uc2 All that he has to do to keep playing is to be convincingly different. The Ukip brand depends not upon exit from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 a possibility under both the Conservatives and Labour \u8211\'20\'13 nor even upon its ferocious stance on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Farage\u8217\'20\'19s claim to our attention depends entirely upon his status as an outsider throwing stones at the glass house of \u8220\'20\'1Cthe political class\u8221\'20\'1D or \u8220\'20\'1Cthe Establishment\u8221\'20\'1D or \u8220\'20\'1Cthe elite\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 This is why he is much more rattled by recent stories about his allowances than he was by (say) Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s long-awaited speech in January 2013 that promised an In/Out referendum before the end of 2017. The allegations concern Farage\u8217\'20\'19s use of EU funds to subsidise his constituency office in Lyminster, West Sussex. The Ukip leader spent about \u163\'00\'A315,500 a year of his MEP\u8217\'20\'19s allowance on the property, even though it was reportedly donated rent-free to the party.\par \par \uc2 Thus Farage was reduced last week to explaining on the airwaves what the money was spent on. \u8220\'20\'1CRunning machines,\u8221\'20\'1D he told Sky News, \u8220\'20\'1Crunning banks of computers; running photocopiers; doing things that use a lot more electricity than many household chores.\u8221\'20\'1D He accused The Times, which broke the story, of being the \u8220\'20\'1Cestablishment newspaper\u8221\'20\'1D (a description I doubt he used when he had dinner last year with its owner, Rupert Murdoch). Ukip then published a ludicrous inventory of Times staff and their connections \u8211\'20\'13 familial or social \u8211\'20\'13 with the Conservative Party, which looked as desperate as it plainly was.\par \par \uc2 Often effective on the attack, Farage has not yet learnt how to handle criticism, or to control the burst capillaries of self-righteousness. He also finds himself precisely where he does not want to be: the object of the sort of inquiries he wishes upon his opponents. Only 11 days ago, he was raking in political capital like poker chips from the Maria Miller expenses affair, insisting that her resignation as Culture Secretary was not enough and that constituency electorates should be granted the right to recall their MPs. \u8220\'20\'1CYet again,\u8221\'20\'1D he declared, \u8220\'20\'1Cthis is the political class looking after its own and letting down the electorate.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Now he stares down the barrel of his favourite gun. The Electoral Commission, which regulates party finance and electoral ethics, has written to Ukip demanding \u8220\'20\'1Cclarification\u8221\'20\'1D of the funding of his constituency office. He also faces potential investigation by the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s anti-fraud office, OLAF.\par \par \uc2 Who knows? These investigations may clear him of all wrongdoing. But he has aggressively encouraged us to assume the worst of all politicians, to take their collective guilt for granted, and to regard their very membership of the \u8220\'20\'1Celite\u8221\'20\'1D or \u8220\'20\'1Cpolitical class\u8221\'20\'1D or \u8220\'20\'1Cestablishment\u8221\'20\'1D as damning in itself. Now he is feeling the rough edge of those same assumptions, the kangaroo court whose only jurisprudence is: \u8220\'20\'1CThey\u8217\'20\'19re all the same\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 What Farage faces in this instance is not the spectre of sleaze but a much more lethal charge: that he is just like the rest of them, just another beige politician. For years, with increasing success, he has cultivated the image of a David taking on the lumbering Goliaths of the post-crash political landscape. He is the Purple Pimpernel, the Reactionary Robin Hood.\par \par \uc2 In an age of austerity and economic anxiety, his message of fear and mutual suspicion \u8211\'20\'13 his claim that much of Britain has become \u8220\'20\'1Cunrecognisable\u8221\'20\'1D and whole areas have been \u8220\'20\'1Ctaken over\u8221\'20\'1D by \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 has found an audience. He plays with fire more cunningly and irresponsibly than any politician I can remember, inviting us to applaud his often-reckless rhetoric as bold honesty. Like all men of his fibre, he warns of \u8220\'20\'1Cextremism\u8221\'20\'1D but insists that his only purpose is to prevent it.\par \par \uc2 To say that Farage is a creature of his times is not intended as a compliment. The late American writer, David Foster Wallace, wrote of the perils of \u8220\'20\'1Cinstitutionalised irony\u8221\'20\'1D. Satire, irreverence and scepticism are the lifeblood of a democracy. But when the sneer is all that a political system has left, it is in trouble. I am not saying that Farage is entirely wrong about the political class. But his combination of saloon-bar scaremongering and fantasy politics \u8211\'20\'13 his wish to turn the clock back economically, socially and culturally \u8211\'20\'13 is part of the problem, not the solution.\par \par \uc2 In a little over a month, the European elections may mark Farage\u8217\'20\'19s finest hour. But his cover is at risk of being blown. He is starting to resemble the very politicians he lives to destroy, deeply resentful that his astonishingly easy ride in the media may be coming to an end, outraged that he should have to take to the airwaves to explain how he spends public money.\par \par \uc2 Behind the anger, you could see the self-pity. And you could see something else, too. It reminded me of the closing lines of Animal Farm: \u8220\'20\'1CThe creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140419ea4j004eg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

I am wondering this as I arrive in West London at the studio where our photoshoot is due to take place.\par \par \uc2 I am wondering this as she greets me with rapturous warmth \u8211\'20\'13 \u8220\'20\'1CSo, so lovely to meet you, Deborah\u8221\'20\'1D \u8211\'20\'13 having taken the trouble to learn my name, which is by no means a foregone conclusion on these occasions. It is awkward. I feel uncomfortable. I decide I\u8217\'20\'19d best get it out the way, so say, \u8220\'20\'1CJoanna, we have history, dating way back to 1976. You\u8217\'20\'19d think it wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t hurt any more, but it still does.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Her beautiful face \u8722\'22\'12 such bones! \u8722\'22\'12 goes all sad and bewildered. Bravely, I press on. \u8220\'20\'1COn the back of the TV series The New Avengers, I had a Purdey haircut. It looked great when I came out of the hairdresser\u8217\'20\'19s. I looked the bee\u8217\'20\'19s knees. But my hair is frizzy as hell, and it reverted to type overnight. By the time I woke up in the morning I looked like a deranged dandelion clock. My mother cried. I was called Brillo Pad at school, even by the teachers. I was 13. I was traumatised.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 I don\u8217\'20\'19t know what reparation I expect her to make. Offer to pay for all the therapy I\u8217\'20\'19ve had since? Clutch me to her bosom, stroke my Brillo Pad hair until her fingers bleed (it is very scratchy) and murmur, \u8220\'20\'1CThere, there.\u8221\'20\'1D But she is wholly unsympathetic.\par \par \uc2 She says when she had the Purdey cut she had to have her hair chemically straightened until the hairdresser refused to do it any more and she was told, \u8220\'20\'1CYou will go bald if you carry on.\u8221\'20\'1D And there was one scene where she hurt her back and it still gives her trouble to this day. OK, I say. I can see Purdey has made you suffer, too, so I forgive you. She is relieved, obviously, but doesn\u8217\'20\'19t say, \u8220\'20\'1CCheers, sweetie,\u8221\'20\'1D which is most disappointing although, in time, I may well get over this, too.\par \par \uc2 Still, I am glad we are friends, because she is fun to be around and funny, and uses words such as \u8220\'20\'1Cbeastly\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1Cjolly\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1Cdear\u8221\'20\'1D, as in \u8220\'20\'1Csuch a dear little house\u8221\'20\'1D, and smokes and keeps her cigarettes in a posh case. She says she has to decant her fags because she can\u8217\'20\'19t bear the cigarette packets with their photographs of diseased lungs and warnings you will get old hands, \u8220\'20\'1Cwhich is a bit rich, as my hands are already old, darling. Look!\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 We talk on. I tell her she was great in her latest role in Martin Scorsese\u8217\'20\'19s The Wolf of Wall Street, as she was. She played Aunt Emma, a money launderer who gets to kiss Leonardo DiCaprio. I\u8217\'20\'19d read the kiss took 27 takes so, out with it, Joanna, did you do it wrong on purpose 26 times?\par \par \uc2 She laughs and says, \u8220\'20\'1CI may have slightly made that number up.\u8221\'20\'1D She adds that DiCaprio \u8220\'20\'1Cwas a honey to work with\u8221\'20\'1D, as was Scorsese. \u8220\'20\'1CHe\u8217\'20\'19s everything you\u8217\'20\'19d expect him to be. Beautifully dressed, heavy glasses, ink-black eyebrows, hair beautifully done.\u8221\'20\'1D And did he ever say, \u8220\'20\'1CJoanna, I loved your work in Sapphire & Steel?\u8221\'20\'1D \u8220\'20\'1CNo, but he did say, \u8216\'20\'18I loved you in Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights [the BBC documentary in which she went to Norway].\u8217\'20\'19 It\u8217\'20\'19s all he wanted to talk about.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 I wish we could just chitchat for ever, but we can\u8217\'20\'19t. Lumley is a woman of purpose and we have met for a purpose. She is not going to let me distract her from this, even though I try my damnedest and suggest we decamp to the nearest pub. Lumley is the face of Shwop, the clothes recycling initiative.\par \par \uc2 Here\u8217\'20\'19s how it works: drop clothes you no longer want in a Shwop Box in any \uc2 Marks & Spencer\uc2  store, and M&S will dispatch them to Oxfam to be sold, recycled or distributed abroad. It\u8217\'20\'19s a fine idea, and has already raised nearly \u163\'00\'A35 million for Oxfam.\par \par \uc2 Lumley has brought in some clothes to Shwop today, including an old bra \u8211\'20\'13 \u8220\'20\'1Cit\u8217\'20\'19s still gorgeous, and they adore bras in Senegal\u8221\'20\'1D \u8211\'20\'13 and a pair of tatty trousers that are a bit \u8220\'20\'1Cdiseased\u8221\'20\'1D but can be \u8220\'20\'1Cshredded\u8221\'20\'1D. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd I forced Stevie, my husband [Stephen Barlow, a composer], to dig some stuff out this morning, so there is this,\u8221\'20\'1D she says. It\u8217\'20\'19s a rather loud Boden shirt. \u8220\'20\'1CSomeone in eastern Europe or Africa would jump on that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Has she ever given away clothes and regretted it? \u8220\'20\'1CLast year,\u8221\'20\'1D she says, \u8220\'20\'1CI bit the bullet and sold all my Patsy [her character in Absolutely Fabulous] clothes, all my treasured Jean Muir dresses and coats, all my film and stage memorabilia, for charity, and I feel fine\u8230\'20\'26 Except for a wonderful pair of camouflage ankle boots with stiletto heels that Patsy wore to Abbey Road when she and Eddy inadvertently wiped the tape recording of the only unreleased Beatles song in existence. I loved those boots. I wish I hadn\u8217\'20\'19t got rid of those.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Lumley is as famous for her causes as the roles she has played. She is patron of too many charities to list and was entirely magnificent when she stood up for the Gurkhas. (Who will ever forget her buttonholing Phil Woolas, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister at the time?)\par \par \uc2 I wonder when she first noted social injustice. Lumley, the daughter of a British Army officer, was brought up in India and Malaya and I imagine she is going to say it was in one of those places. Instead, she says it was when she went to boarding school in England. \u8220\'20\'1CI was 8, and we were given these Barnardo\u8217\'20\'19s boxes, which were dear little houses, with dear little doors in them and a slit in the roof you could put your money in, and I remember saving up for Barnardo\u8217\'20\'19s.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Lumley\u8217\'20\'19s conversation can go from something quite frothy to something wholly serious in the blink of an eye. She\u8217\'20\'19ll be going through the clothes rails, choosing items to wear for the shoot, and choosing items not to wear, in her wonderfully polite way \u8211\'20\'13 \u8220\'20\'1CI can\u8217\'20\'19t wear that, darling, because people will then think it\u8217\'20\'19s the sort of thing I do wear\u8221\'20\'1D \u8211\'20\'13 and then suddenly it\u8217\'20\'19s: \u8220\'20\'1CIran isn\u8217\'20\'19t at Geneva, and Syria just isn\u8217\'20\'19t settling itself.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Has she ever been horrid or unkind? She has to think for quite a while. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m sure I have and I wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t have meant to. I think I have been two-faced. Depending on the company you keep, you go, \u8216\'20\'18Yes, yes, I know. I thought so, too. She looks frightful.\u8217\'20\'19 I\u8217\'20\'19m sure I\u8217\'20\'19ve done that. It\u8217\'20\'19s the easiest one to fall into. It\u8217\'20\'19s partly because you want to ingratiate yourself with the people you\u8217\'20\'19re with and to take a popular view. I think things like that are hateful, and I try not to get into that now. It makes me a terrible prig. People say, \u8216\'20\'18What\u8217\'20\'19s the gossip?\u8217\'20\'19 and I haven\u8217\'20\'19t got any gossip.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Lumley is quick to anger, can turn fierce at the drop of a hat and is fiercely angry about the way newspapers and magazines dissect how women look, particularly after red-carpet events. \u8220\'20\'1CAfter a recent one, which I think was the Golden Globes, there was a paper that was \u8216\'20\'18Yes, yes, yes, you look marvellous,\u8217\'20\'19 and then \u8216\'20\'18Oh dear, you\u8217\'20\'19ve got it wrong,\u8217\'20\'19 and it was a picture of Emma Thompson looking, I thought, wonderful, fabulous.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Lumley is 68 next month, which seems ludicrous to her. \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t feel it,\u8221\'20\'1D she says, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut then I look in a mirror and see I am actually an old lady.\u8221\'20\'1D She uses Astral cream, which is \u8220\'20\'1Cwonderful stuff\u8221\'20\'1D, and \u8220\'20\'1Ccheap and comes in a big blue tub\u8221\'20\'1D. But she is now considering Botox. \u8220\'20\'1CI think everyone in the world is tempted to have work done, and I\u8217\'20\'19m not against it. We all work on everything. I dye my hair, have done for ages. If I didn\u8217\'20\'19t, I\u8217\'20\'19d be very, very grey and I don\u8217\'20\'19t want to be that yet. I don\u8217\'20\'19t use spray tan but all the young people do it and look gorgeous so I\u8217\'20\'19m going to have one before I go to Iran [to make a documentary for ITV]. And my bosom would be down to my waist if I didn\u8217\'20\'19t wear a bra.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEverything we do is to make ourselves better, and Botox? I don\u8217\'20\'19t see why not. I\u8217\'20\'19ve got such an over-mobile face and I think I might like to be more like Bette Davis. If you look at her, nothing happens on her face. I wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be surprised if all those old girls in the old days had Botox. It\u8217\'20\'19s, \u8216\'20\'18Rhett, I love you. Rhett, I have always loved you.\u8217\'20\'19 And nothing. They didn\u8217\'20\'19t do anything with their faces. All this thing about oh, it makes your face still. What could be better?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 I don\u8217\'20\'19t know, I say. I think it\u8217\'20\'19s weird that we have feminism yet it\u8217\'20\'19s also acceptable for women to inject poisons into their heads. She says: \u8220\'20\'1CAs the French say, faut souffrir pour \u234\'00\'EAtre belle \u8211\'20\'13 one must suffer to be beautiful. Women used to put lead on their faces to whiten them, and got lead poisoning. And Chinese women binding their feet\u8230\'20\'26\u8221\'20\'1D And Purdey cuts? \u8220\'20\'1CAnd Purdey cuts,\u8221\'20\'1D she laughs.\par \par \uc2 I ask if she considers herself a feminist. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat do you mean?\u8221\'20\'1D she says. \u8220\'20\'1CEqual pay for equal work? Then of course I\u8217\'20\'19m a feminist. But there is something else. Angry women. I think I have to be angrier than I am to be a feminist. There is this fury at other women by some feminists, and I don\u8217\'20\'19t know what they are angry about, so I\u8217\'20\'19m not sure.\u8221\'20\'1D She then adds, rather sadly, \u8220\'20\'1CThis revolution was bound to come, that women are the same as men, but I don\u8217\'20\'19t think women are the same as men.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 How are we different? \u8220\'20\'1CI just feel that we think differently, achieve things by different methods. I think women like chitter-chattering together and I don\u8217\'20\'19t think men do. I think men like board meetings, and I am not sure women love them quite so much. I think women tend to use fewer utensils when cooking than men. I think women like buying new things rather too often while it is hard to get men to part with an old friendly garment. But I don\u8217\'20\'19t even think of myself as a woman, just a person. Not even a person: a pair of eyes on a periscope stick.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Lumley first worked as a model, in London in the Sixties. Did she ever suffer from what we used to call \u8220\'20\'1Cwandering-hand syndrome\u8221\'20\'1D but is now treated as something far more serious? Was it serious all along, and we just didn\u8217\'20\'19t know it? \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t know. It just became what men did.\u8221\'20\'1D She says Sister Elizabeth at her convent school gave them a talk about this. \u8220\'20\'1CShe had never known a man in the biblical sense, but was tremendously wise and when we were in the fifth or sixth form, she said, \u8216\'20\'18Don\u8217\'20\'19t lead men on because they get to a point when they really can\u8217\'20\'19t stop, and it\u8217\'20\'19s not fair, so don\u8217\'20\'19t do it and don\u8217\'20\'19t be silly. They are different from us in that way.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI thought, \u8216\'20\'18What a wise thing.\u8217\'20\'19 In those days, there used to be men whose hands would linger on your waist. That always went on. As for being insulted, you learn graceful ways to get round it. This is not dissing the women who have had their lives wrecked, although why some took 50 years to say it, I don\u8217\'20\'19t know. It\u8217\'20\'19s difficult. Of course we want people who have been raped to be treated seriously at the police station, which I don\u8217\'20\'19t think they were [back then], but I think it could have gone quite far now. Being patted on the bottom, no. It\u8217\'20\'19s not assault.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 I don\u8217\'20\'19t know if Lumley ever does self-pity. She was an unmarried mother, having had a son, James, in 1967 with the photographer Michael Claydon (she didn\u8217\'20\'19t reveal his name for many years), and she didn\u8217\'20\'19t marry Barlow until 1986. So she brought up James on her own, which must have been hard. The money was hard, she says, because there wasn\u8217\'20\'19t family money and models weren\u8217\'20\'19t paid what they are today, and there were periods when she was unemployed, \u8220\'20\'1Cso it was a lot of Marmite on toast. And I remember Jamie was into Star Trek, and I couldn\u8217\'20\'19t afford to buy him a T-shirt, but I made a thing that looked like the V-shaped chevron and sewed it onto one of his T-shirts, with tiny, mouse-like stitches, and when he came home from school I said, \u8216\'20\'18Was it all right?\u8217\'20\'19 And he said, \u8216\'20\'18It\u8217\'20\'19s upside down.\u8217\'20\'19 Tragic. Just tragic.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Did she get any state support? \u8220\'20\'1CBecause I was a model, I was called self-employed, so couldn\u8217\'20\'19t get the dole. Someone said I could get child benefit but then someone else told me, \u8216\'20\'18Posh people like you don\u8217\'20\'19t get it.\u8217\'20\'19 I was shocked by that, and humiliated, and so ignorant of my rights I didn\u8217\'20\'19t get that either. It was slim pickings, but I have to say it wasn\u8217\'20\'19t sorrowful. Not going on holiday didn\u8217\'20\'19t trouble me a bit. I would buy clothes in charity shops for 70p. Now children are teased if they don\u8217\'20\'19t have the right trainers and that is so sad.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Lumley has done everything, pretty much. She has made documentaries and acted in films and on stage and on television and if you didn\u8217\'20\'19t love her as smoking, pouting, snarling, champagne-quaffing Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous, then there is something seriously wrong with you. I ask if she found it difficult to identify with that part of Patsy that cares only for herself. \u8220\'20\'1CNo,\u8221\'20\'1D she says. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s all acting. Acting is only pretending to be someone else. Actors often portray people they don\u8217\'20\'19t approve of, or even like, but actually I love Patsy. I am not her, but she belongs to me.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Lumley has many projects on the go. There is the trip to Iran, and her BBC documentary Joanna Lumley Meets will.i.am aired in March. Plus, there was The Wolf of Wall Street, although she wasn\u8217\'20\'19t first choice for Emma, she wants me to know. \u8220\'20\'1CMy take on the story is that Julie Andrews couldn\u8217\'20\'19t do it [she was recovering from ankle surgery] and Eileen Atkins was asked but couldn\u8217\'20\'19t do it, and then, maybe after 20 people, it came to me. But I don\u8217\'20\'19t care. Never mind when someone drops out or someone doesn\u8217\'20\'19t want to do it, just get the part. Yeah, lovely.\u8221\'20\'1D Yeah, lovely. Joanna Lumley, that is. And all is forgiven, at last.\par \par \uc2 Shwopping is supported by M&S ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://marksandspencer.com/shwopping"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 marksandspencer.com/shwopping}}}\uc2 )\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140419ea4j00232\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Books | THE WEEK IN BOOKS\par \par \uc2 Reading aloud stops dead for a lot of children at a certain age. I had almost forgotten about the thrill of it until someone asked me about my early reading experience, a few days ago. Well, I went to school, I read, I was read to, and I came home again, I thought at first. Then again, it could have been very different when you consider that I was one of the "dreaded" \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  children who showed up in class with no word of English at five. Very different had it not been for the school - St Paul's in Primrose Hill, North London - and the teachers. Particularly our Class Five teacher Mr Wilkinson, who lived in Oxfordshire (he would drive in in his red soft-top Porsche convertible) and who was friends with Roald Dahl.\par \par \uc2 He'd talk about popping over to Roald's and give other flashy details that meant little to us, like the Porsche. How he marked us was with the stories he read aloud: were these early unpublished Roald Dahl chapters tried out on us? Maybe they were, if memory is not now eliding with fantasy. The whole of Class Five - 30-odd state-school pupils - would sit rapt, listening to Mr Wilkinson read. There were always protest when he stopped.\par \par \uc2 The pleasures of childhood reading are of particular interest to me as I've just signed up to be a judge of the Montegrappa Scholastic Prize for New Children's Writing (The Independent is a partner), which is aimed at unpublished authors. And reading for pleasure, I'm told by Samantha Smith, publisher at Scholastic, is key to later learning and educational achievement. Recent analysis at Durham University found that the more often children reported reading for pleasure, the higher their attainment in GCSE English.\par \par \uc2 At some stage, being read to - even a Roald Dahl story by a man who knew Roald Dahl - became less preferable, and pleasurable, than reading for myself, but by then, Mr Wilkinson had done his job. My love of books was firmly intact, and I was just traversing the natural stages, according to Louise Lamont, a literary agent for children's fiction at LBA, and co-judge of the prize, who talks about the phases: "reading" picture books, being read to, reading to others, and finally - the pinnacle of achievement - reading to ourselves. All good and well, but I agree with Ms Smith when she questions whether there should be cut-off points between children's ways of reading and that of adults. Children stop reading picture-books , for instance, when they're driven to by books available for their age range, (around seven or eight). Does this weaning take away from the pleasure of reading and even turn off weaker readers? Possibly, though it seems as if the rules are increasingly being bent or broken. Pictures are seeping into books for older children and illustrators/writers such as Chris Riddell, author of the brilliant Goth Girl and Liz Pichon, author of the Tom Gates series who became an illustrator partly because of childhood dyslexia, now tell bewitching stories for older children with a delightful mix of words and images.\par \par \uc2 There is delight for adults too: the Folio Society's stunning illustrated editions give added value. \uc2 Ali Smith\uc2 's Shire recently combined story with images and George Saunders's lecture, Congratulations, by the way, published next week, comes with decorated pages (though isn't it a bit steep to price a book of 52 pages at \u163\'00\'A38.99?). Graphic novels, one could say, are an adult adjunct to the picture-book in which storytelling weaves words with images. The fact that this narrative form is finally being accepted by the literary establishment confirms that our rigid boundaries are giving way. Long live the picture-book, for kids and adults alike.\par \par \uc2 E-READERS ARE THE NEXT CHAPTER FOR ELDERLY BOOK-LOVERS\par \par \uc2 There are those who think that digital reading is for the young, and young alone. Not Margaret Drabble, who echoes recent findings to remind us that eReaders can be a joy for the elderly too. A spritely 74 herself, she regards her eReader as "one of my most treasured possessions". She is, I'm told, constantly being asked about the supposed "threat" of the digital age for publishers of physical books. In fact, she thinks this new-fangled way is perfect for the older generation who can benefit from light-weight readers and far cheaper prices. Her The Millstone, The Peppered Moth, and trilogy of The Radiant Way, A Natural Curiosity and The Gates of Ivory, will become available digitally next month.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140419ea4j0003v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Weekend Life\par \b \uc2 Running scared\b0\par\par\uc2 Gaby Soutar   \par \uc2 769 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 April 2014\par \uc2 The Scotsman\par \uc2 SC\par 50\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014   \par \par \uc2 Our zombies have to go to zombie school, where we teach them how to chase and perform," says Bristol-based writer and director James Wheale, "Scaring little old ladies on their way to the shop is a definite no-no."\par \par \uc2 On four dates in May (23, 24, 30 and 31 May) the 2.8 Hours Later experience is returning to Edinburgh for the second year, before its third visit to Glasgow on 15, 16, 22 and 23 August.\par \par \uc2 For those unfamiliar with the concept, this is a cross-city chase, created by games company SlingShot. Think of it as a live film or computer game, with you and the other participants, all of whom must be over 18, as the heroes. Actors and volunteers play police officers, the living dead, government officials and other characters who help drive the narrative, which spans a couple of hours.\par \par \uc2 The exact location point for the game isn't revealed until a week before the event, but starting in the "asylum", participants are given a mission and a map to help them find the first checkpoint, where they unlock the information required to find the next co-ordinate, and so on.\par \par \uc2 As Wheale, 25, explains, "The city becomes a living, breathing prop."\par \par \uc2 The aim is to make it back to the asylum eventually, uninfected and with all tasks complete.\par \par \uc2 This year's storyline - Survival - is a sequel to 2013's tale, Asylum, which, in Edinburgh, involved a narrative that took place in the city centre, then moved to Leith.\par \par \uc2 "Our players started as illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 ," says Wheale. "They were given leave to find their paperwork, and, if they couldn't, they were placed in quarantine, which involved being dumped on the other side of the fence. Here, they learnt of a resistance movement called Asylum - in the badlands outside the city limits. The players escaped to this place, where this year's game starts."\par \par \uc2 You don't have to have taken part in the prequel to understand what's going on in Survival, although, there are sure to be a few attendees who are veterans. After all, as Wheale says, "Scots are zombie mad" - especially Glaswegians.\par \par \uc2 "All the Glasgow guys come to Edinburgh and London to play the game, they have a real passion," he explains. "Some of them played zombies in World War Z when it was shot in Glasgow. They gave us a tour and showed us the locations."\par \par \uc2 It's often assumed most taking part would be young males, but according to Wheale, "There are slightly more women than men.\par \par \uc2 "And the age range is vast. We've had three generations of one family play before, which kind of contributes to the strangeness."\par \par \uc2 The players all wear armbands, so the organisers can identify them. This also comes in handy should rogue civilians get carried away and gatecrash proceedings.\par \par \uc2 "It's rare, but if that happens, our stage managers take them aside and explain what's happening," Wheale says. "Most of the time people just want to film it on their phones and are anything from completely bemused to thrilled when the zombies appear."\par \par \uc2 Wheale won't say exactly how many walking dead there will be. However, he does reveal that there were 1,600 applications for their advertised vacancies in Cardiff, and only slightly less in other locations.\par \par \uc2 Rather than biting, the zombies stamp players with UV ink and, thus, "mark them with the infection" so that, at the end of the event, those who've been caught will become undead, courtesy of one of SlingShot's make-up artists.\par \par \uc2 Though the game is strictly non-contact, we imagine it's still terrifying to come close to one of these actors, dripping in faux gore.\par \par \uc2 "We've had people too frightened to continue and they've just gone to the disco that we have at the end of the event," says Wheale. "We'll go out of our way to help but, at the same time, some people just need a gentle push. It's like when you lose your resolve in the queue to the rollercoaster."\par \par \uc2 Except it's worse than the Big Dipper, because they've all been to zombie school.\par \par \uc2 "Type ones are slow and type twos are the 28 Days Later-style running and chasing kind," says Wheale. "They're all unique characters with their own noise, because you don't want hundreds of zombies who sound exactly the same. Each has a horrible individual voice that penetrates the night sky."\par \par \uc2 Tickets from GBP38 per person, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.2.8hourslater.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 www.2.8hourslater.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document SC00000020140419ea4j0000h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw59\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal885\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Life lessons, according to Joanna Lumley. (Warning: she doesn't do self-pity)\par \par \uc2 The actress Joanna Lumley and I have history, although she doesn't know it, and I'm wondering if I should say anything. I am wondering this as I arrive in West London at the studio where our photoshoot is due to take place. I am wondering this as she greets me with rapturous warmth - "So, so lovely to meet you, Deborah" - having taken the trouble to learn my name, which is by no means a foregone conclusion on these occasions. It is awkward. I feel uncomfortable. I decide I'd best get it out the way, so say, "Joanna, we have history, dating way back to 1976. You'd think it wouldn't hurt any more, but it still does."\par \par \uc2 Her beautiful face -such bones! -goes all sad and bewildered. Bravely, I press on. "On the back of the TV series The New Avengers, I had a Purdey haircut. It looked great when I came out of the hairdresser's. I looked the bee's knees. But my hair is frizzy as hell, and it reverted to type overnight. By the time I woke up in the morning I looked like a deranged dandelion clock. My mother cried. I was called Brillo Pad at school, even by the teachers. I was 13. I was traumatised."\par \par \uc2 I don't know what reparation I expect her to make. Offer to pay for all the therapy I've had since? Clutch me to her bosom, stroke my Brillo Pad hair until her fingers bleed (it is very scratchy) and murmur, "There, there." But she is wholly unsympathetic.\par \par \uc2 She says when she had the Purdey cut she had to have her hair chemically straightened until the hairdresser refused to do it any more and she was told, "You will go bald if you carry on." And there was one scene where she hurt her back and it still gives her trouble to this day. OK, I say. I can see Purdey has made you suffer, too, so I forgive you. She is relieved, obviously, but doesn't say, "Cheers, sweetie," which is most disappointing although, in time, I may well get over this, too.\par \par \uc2 Still, I am glad we are friends, because she is fun to be around and funny, and uses words such as "beastly" and "jolly" and "dear", as in "such a dear little house", and smokes and keeps her cigarettes in a posh case. She says she has to decant her fags because she can't bear the cigarette packets with their photographs of diseased lungs and warnings you will get old hands, "which is a bit rich, as my hands are already old, darling. Look!" We talk on. I tell her she was great in her latest role in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, as she was.\par \par \uc2 She played Aunt Emma, a money launderer who gets to kiss Leonardo DiCaprio. I'd read the kiss took 27 takes so, out with it, Joanna, did you do it wrong on purpose 26 times? She laughs and says, "I may have slightly made that number up."\par \par \uc2 She adds that DiCaprio "was a honey to work with", as was Scorsese. "He's everything you'd expect him to be. Beautifully dressed, heavy glasses, ink-black eyebrows, hair beautifully done." And did he ever say, "Joanna, I loved your work in Sapphire & Steel?" "No, but he did say, 'I loved you in Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights [the BBC documentary in which she went to Norway].' It's all he wanted to talk about."\par \par \uc2 I wish we could just chitchat for ever, but we can't. Lumley is a woman of purpose and we have met for a purpose. She is not going to let me distract her from this, even though I try my damnedest and suggest we decamp to the nearest pub. Lumley is the face of Shwop, the clothes recycling initiative.\par \par \uc2 Here's how it works: drop clothes you no longer want in a Shwop Box in any \uc2 Marks & Spencer\uc2  store, and M&S will dispatch them to Oxfam to be sold, recycled or distributed abroad. It's a fine idea, and has already raised nearly \u163\'00\'A35 million for Oxfam.\par \par \uc2 Lumley has brought in some clothes to Shwop today, including an old bra - "it's still gorgeous, and they adore bras in Senegal" - and a pair of tatty trousers that are a bit "diseased" but can be "shredded". "And I forced Stevie, my husband [Stephen Barlow, a composer], to dig some stuff out this morning, so there is this," she says. It's a rather loud Boden shirt. "Someone in eastern Europe or Africa would jump on that."\par \par \uc2 Has she ever given away clothes and regretted it? "Last year," she says, "I bit the bullet and sold all my Patsy [her character in Absolutely Fabulous] clothes, all my treasured Jean Muir dresses and coats, all my film and stage memorabilia, for charity, and I feel fine\u8230\'20\'26 Except for a wonderful pair of camouflage ankle boots with stiletto heels that Patsy wore to Abbey Road when she and Eddy inadvertently wiped the tape recording of the only unreleased Beatles song in existence. I loved those boots. I wish I hadn't got rid of those."\par \par \uc2 Lumley is as famous for her causes as the roles she has played. She is patron of too many charities to list and was entirely magnificent when she stood up for the Gurkhas. (Who will ever forget her buttonholing Phil Woolas, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister at the time?) I wonder when she first noted social injustice. Lumley, the daughter of a British Army officer, was brought up in India and Malaya and I imagine she is going to say it was in one of those places. Instead, she says it was when she went to boarding school in England. "I was 8, and we were given these Barnardo's boxes, which were dear little houses, with dear little doors in them and a slit in the roof you could put your money in, and I remember saving up for Barnardo's."\par \par \uc2 Lumley's conversation can go from something quite frothy to something wholly serious in the blink of an eye. She'll be going through the clothes rails, choosing items to wear for the shoot, and choosing items not to wear, in her wonderfully polite way - "I can't wear that, darling, because people will then think it's the sort of thing I do wear" - and then suddenly it's: "Iran isn't at Geneva, and Syria just isn't settling itself."\par \par \uc2 Has she ever been horrid or unkind? She has to think for quite a while. "I'm sure I have and I wouldn't have meant to. I think I have been two-faced. Depending on the company you keep, you go, 'Yes, yes, I know. I thought so, too. She looks frightful.' I'm sure I've done that. It's the easiest one to fall into. It's partly because you want to ingratiate yourself with the people you're with and to take a popular view. I think things like that are hateful, and I try not to get into that now. It makes me a terrible prig. People say, 'What's the gossip?' and I haven't got any gossip."\par \par \uc2 Lumley is quick to anger, can turn fierce at the drop of a hat and is fiercely angry about the way newspapers and magazines dissect how women look, particularly after red-carpet events. "After a recent one, which I think was the Golden Globes, there was a paper that was 'Yes, yes, yes, you look marvellous,' and then 'Oh dear, you've got it wrong,' and it was a picture of Emma Thompson looking, I thought, wonderful, fabulous."\par \par \uc2 Lumley is 68 next month, which seems ludicrous to her. "I don't feel it," she says, "but then I look in a mirror and see I am actually an old lady." She uses Astral cream, which is "wonderful stuff", and "cheap and comes in a big blue tub". But she is now considering Botox. "I think everyone in the world is tempted to have work done, and I'm not against it. We all work on everything. I dye my hair, have done for ages. If I didn't, I'd be very, very grey and I don't want to be that yet. I don't use spray tan but all the young people do it and look gorgeous so I'm going to have one before I go to Iran [to make a documentary for ITV]. And my bosom would be down to my waist if I didn't wear a bra.\par \par \uc2 "Everything we do is to make ourselves better, and Botox? I don't see why not. I've got such an over-mobile face and I think I might like to be more like Bette Davis. If you look at her, nothing happens on her face. I wouldn't be surprised if all those old girls in the old days had Botox. It's, 'Rhett, I love you. Rhett, I have always loved you.' And nothing. They didn't do anything with their faces. All this thing about oh, it makes your face still. What could be better?" I don't know, I say. I think it's weird that we have feminism yet it's also acceptable for women to inject poisons into their heads. She says: "As the French say, faut souffrir pour \u234\'00\'EAtre belle - one must suffer to be beautiful. Women used to put lead on their faces to whiten them, and got lead poisoning. And Chinese women binding their feet\u8230\'20\'26" And Purdey cuts? "And Purdey cuts," she laughs.\par \par \uc2 I ask if she considers herself a feminist.\par \par \uc2 "What do you mean?" she says. "Equal pay for equal work? Then of course I'm a feminist. But there is something else. Angry women. I think I have to be angrier than I am to be a feminist. There is this fury at other women by some feminists, and I don't know what they are angry about, so I'm not sure." She then adds, rather sadly, "This revolution was bound to come, that women are the same as men, but I don't think women are the same as men."\par \par \uc2 How are we different? "I just feel that we think differently, achieve things by different methods. I think women like chitter-chattering together and I don't think men do. I think men like board meetings, and I am not sure women love them quite so much. I think women tend to use fewer utensils when cooking than men. I think women like buying new things rather too often while it is hard to get men to part with an old friendly garment. But I don't even think of myself as a woman, just a person. Not even a person: a pair of eyes on a periscope stick."\par \par \uc2 Lumley first worked as a model, in London in the Sixties. Did she ever suffer from what we used to call "wandering-hand syndrome" but is now treated as something far more serious? Was it serious all along, and we just didn't know it? "I don't know. It just became what men did." She says Sister Elizabeth at her convent school gave them a talk about this. "She had never known a man in the biblical sense, but was tremendously wise and when we were in the fifth or sixth form, she said, 'Don't lead men on because they get to a point when they really can't stop, and it's not fair, so don't do it and don't be silly. They are different from us in that way.' "I thought, 'What a wise thing.' In those days, there used to be men whose hands would linger on your waist. That always went on. As for being insulted, you learn graceful ways to get round it. This is not dissing the women who have had their lives wrecked, although why some took 50 years to say it, I don't know. It's difficult. Of course we want people who have been raped to be treated seriously at the police station, which I don't think they were [back then], but I think it could have gone quite far now. Being patted on the bottom, no. It's not assault."\par \par \uc2 I don't know if Lumley ever does self-pity. She was an unmarried mother, having had a son, James, in 1967 with the photographer Michael Claydon (she didn't reveal his name for many years), and she didn't marry Barlow until 1986. So she brought up James on her own, which must have been hard. The money was hard, she says, because there wasn't family money and models weren't paid what they are today, and there were periods when she was unemployed, "so it was a lot of Marmite on toast. And I remember Jamie was into Star Trek, and I couldn't afford to buy him a T-shirt, but I made a thing that looked like the V-shaped chevron and sewed it onto one of his T-shirts, with tiny, mouse-like stitches, and when he came home from school I said, 'Was it all right?' And he said, 'It's upside down.' Tragic. Just tragic."\par \par \uc2 Did she get any state support? "Because I was a model, I was called self-employed, so couldn't get the dole. Someone said I could get child benefit but then someone else told me, 'Posh people like you don't get it.'\par \par \uc2 I was shocked by that, and humiliated, and so ignorant of my rights I didn't get that either. It was slim pickings, but I have to say it wasn't sorrowful. Not going on holiday didn't trouble me a bit. I would buy clothes in charity shops for 70p. Now children are teased if they don't have the right trainers and that is so sad."\par \par \uc2 Lumley has done everything, pretty much.\par \par \uc2 She has made documentaries and acted in films and on stage and on television and if you didn't love her as smoking, pouting, snarling, champagne-quaffing Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous, then there is something seriously wrong with you. I ask if she found it difficult to identify with that part of Patsy that cares only for herself. "No," she says. "It's all acting.\par \par \uc2 Acting is only pretending to be someone else. Actors often portray people they don't approve of, or even like, but actually I love Patsy. I am not her, but she belongs to me."\par \par \uc2 Lumley has many projects on the go. There is the trip to Iran, and her BBC documentary Joanna Lumley Meets will.i.am aired in March. Plus, there was The Wolf of Wall Street, although she wasn't first choice for Emma, she wants me to know. "My take on the story is that Julie Andrews couldn't do it [she was recovering from ankle surgery] and Eileen Atkins was asked but couldn't do it, and then, maybe after 20 people, it came to me. But I don't care. Never mind when someone drops out or someone doesn't want to do it, just get the part. Yeah, lovely." Yeah, lovely. Joanna Lumley, that is. And all is forgiven, at last.\par \par \uc2 Shwopping is supported by M&S (marksandspencer.com/shwopping)\par \par \uc2 'Botox? I don't see why not. I look In a mIrror and see an old lady.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 It's been revealed airport staff secretly open thousands of holidaymakers' bags. But that's just the start of it ...\par \par \uc2 BY TOM RAWSTORNE\par \par \uc2 Standing by the luggage carousel at Stansted Air-port, photography student Callum Sampson was about to experience every traveller's worst nightmare.\par \par \uc2 Not only was his bag the last to arrive on the conveyor belt, when he went to pick it up he quickly realised it was no longer zipped shut.\par \par \uc2 'I took it off, opened it up and could immediately see that a bag inside containing my camera kit had been gone through and that \u163\'00\'A35,000 worth of equipment had been taken,' said the 31-year-old from Newquay, Cornwall.\par \par \uc2 But that wasn't all. On closer inspection, he noticed that a birthday card his family had given him, which was in a sealed envelope, had been ripped open.\par \par \uc2 'Someone had obviously gone to the trouble of looking to see whether there was any money in it,' said Mr Sampson.\par \par \uc2 'In a strange way, despite all I had lost, that was probably the part that left me feeling most violated. I could understand them wanting camera equipment, but to go to the lengths of opening a card in someone's bag, that really stung me.'\par \par \uc2 The theft happened in July after Callum had checked his bags onto a \uc2 Ryanair\uc2  flight from Norway.\par \par \uc2 Despite reporting the loss to the police, the airline and to the company responsible for handling the luggage, to this day no one has accepted responsibility.\par \par \uc2 As a result, and because Callum did not have any travel insurance, he has been left out of pocket.\par \par \uc2 The million or so holidaymakers who are boarding planes at British airports this weekend to take advantage of the Easter break would do well to heed the harsh lesson this young man learned.\par \par \uc2 Why? Because last year a staggering 22 million items of luggage were 'mishandled' around the globe.\par \par \uc2 The term covers bags delayed, lost or stolen, as well as those damaged or that have contents taken from them.\par \par \uc2 The number of mishandled bags equates to roughly seven bags per 1,000. But European flyers are more likely to suffer than anywhere else \u8212\'20\'14 here, nine bags per 1,000 go walkabout or are damaged, compared with just three per 1,000 in America and less than two per 1,000 in Asia.\par \par \uc2 And it's not just thieves who could be rifling through your luggage after check-in. British border officials also secretly search through thousands of travellers' suitcases each year.\par \par \uc2 They say such searches are necessary in the war against drugs, crime and terrorism, but they are not obliged to tell passengers they have been rooting through their personal possessions.\par \par \uc2 It was recently revealed that even private correspondence and medical records are considered fair game by Border Force officials, some of whom have also been found to be ignoring set procedures when opening bags.\par \par \uc2 While many members of the public will agree that anything is acceptable when it comes to fighting crime or terrorism, the fact is that, despite acting on intelligence, only a third of these searches carried out between April and September last year found anything suspicious.\par \par \uc2 When they did, the majority simply involved cigarettes or alcohol.\par \par \uc2 It is hardly surprising, then, that there are those who believe the rules around these searches urgently need to be tightened up.\par \par \uc2 'Going on holiday shouldn't put your privacy at risk because of over-zealous luggage snoopers,' said Emma Carr, of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, this week.\par \par \uc2 'It is not acceptable for luggage to be searched without a proper process followed and records kept \u8212\'20\'14 no bag should ever get opened unless it is necessary to do so.\par \par \uc2 'Ultimately, it is absolutely essential that people are able to \uc2 seek\uc2  redress.\par \par \uc2 'But how can you complain about a dodgy search if you don't even know your bags have been opened?'\par \par \uc2 Last year, 228 million passengers passed through British airports. While they will be familiar with the \u160\'00\'A0tiresome checks and searches they and their hand luggage are subjected to, travellers are generally so relieved to get rid of their suitcases that they don't give another thought to what happens to them after they are checked in. But the reality is that this is just the start of a long, complicated and ultimately risky journey for the bag and its contents.\par \par \uc2 Once on its way, the luggage label that has been wrapped around the bag's handle is read by a barcode scanner, allowing it to be routed automatically through the network of conveyors and onto the plane.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, when luggage comes off a plane, the barcode is supposed to ensure it is routed to the correct carousel. This is no simple task.\par \par \uc2 At Heathrow there are 30 miles of conveyors with 2.8 miles of tunnels and 44 baggage reclaim belts. Around 53 million bags pass through every year. All luggage is passed through X-ray machines and CTX (computer tomography X-ray) scanners, which can check the bags automatically for explosives.\par \par \uc2 If the bag shows up a potential problem, an image of inside the case will be posted to screens constantly monitored by security officials. They will then decide if it needs manual examination.\par \par \uc2 This is a crucial step in ensuring explosive materials are not smuggled into the hold of a plane.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, anything else deemed suspicious will be noted and relayed to Customs and border officials at the flight's destination. 'If, for example, someone was flying in from Spain and their outward bag had been scanned by the Spanish and found to have 10,000 cigarettes stashed in it, a message might be sent ahead to the receiving airport,' says Chris Yates, an aviation security analyst.\par \par \uc2 'When it arrives here, it will be identified, opened and the contents verified. It will then be put back on the carousel, after which the people who collect it will find themselves being stopped as they go through Customs.'\par \par \uc2 While that sounds straightforward, concerns about how these searches are being conducted were raised in an official report earlier this month by John Vine, the Chief Inspector of Borders and \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He studied hundreds of searches at our regional airports from April to September last year. (Though there is no national figure collated by the Home Office, experts say the number of bags searched across all British airports could run to five figures annually).\par \par \uc2 Mr Vine found a lack of consistent rules on how such searches should be conducted.\par \par \uc2 At Luton, staff were doing searches without seeking approval from managers, who are required by law to sign off on all searches.\par \par \uc2 Record-keeping was so sloppy at Edinburgh, Luton and Manchester that in half the notebooks Mr Vine examined there was no record of who authorised the search.\par \par \uc2 And staff were not recording why searches were needed. More worryingly, the report showed two thirds of searches turn up nothing and owners are never told.\par \par \uc2 The report said: 'Staff at Edinburgh told us they would be content to examine material they considered confidential during a baggage examination.\par \par \uc2 'Examples of confidential material discussed during staff focus groups included passengers' personal medical records and legally privileged correspondence.'\par \par \uc2 Home Office rules clearly state that any searches of confidential personal material need approval by a senior manager and the Surveillance Commissioner.\par \par \uc2 Mr Vine said it was a 'cause for concern' that there was no staff guidance on what to do when sensitive personal material was discovered. He called for urgent updated guidance on how the powers should be used.\par \par \uc2 A Border Force spokesman said: 'The searching of baggage, including when the owner is not present, is a legal and proportionate response to ensuring illegal goods are prevented from entering the UK and protecting revenue.'\par \par \uc2 And it is not just the British who check bags in this way.\par \par \uc2 Fly to the U.S. and the chance of your luggage being searched is far higher, something regular visitors will know. The \uc2 Transportation Security Administration\uc2  (TSA) manually searches bags and it has developed locks that can be bought by travellers.\par \par \uc2 Rather than having to cut them off to open bags, officials hold master keys that can open them.\par \par \uc2 Unlike in Britain, the TSA puts a notice in any bag that's been searched, so a passenger knows if their bag has been opened.\par \par \uc2 'I think what is going on in the U.S. is excessive, without a shadow of a doubt,' says Mr Yates.\par \par \uc2 'They went overboard after 9/11 and are still going overboard in 2014, to the extent that virtually every passenger is treated as a criminal until proven innocent, not the other way round.\par \par \uc2 'Your bags may well be opened on the way in and the way out.'\par \par \uc2 On more than one occasion, Mr Yates says he has noticed items of his luggage missing after a TSA search.\par \par \uc2 'I don't think that it's necessarily theft,' he says. 'More like shoddy practice. They search through and drop something on the floor \u8212\'20\'14 say a tie or something \u8212\'20\'14 then don't bother to pick it up or put it back.\par \par \uc2 'It is one reason I never place anything of value in my luggage.'\par \par \uc2 While such losses may be accidental, thefts do take place, as the statistics attest.\par \par \uc2 Of those 22 million mishandled bags, delayed luggage accounts for 81 per cent of the total.\par \par \uc2 But 15.5 per cent are cases that have been damaged or pilfered from, with the remainder being bags that are lost or stolen.\par \par \uc2 In the Eighties, staff at Heathrow had such a reputation for rifling through passengers' luggage that the airport was nicknamed 'Thief-row'. Following an undercover police operation using hidden cameras, half of all \uc2 British Airways\uc2 ' baggage handlers were arrested.\par \par \uc2 The problems with baggage handlers continue to this day.\par \par \uc2 Last month, a police operation at Los Angeles Airport busted what is thought to be one of the biggest property heists in airport history. Six baggage handlers were arrested, though more staff are believed to be involved.\par \par \uc2 The individuals targeted bags as they came off conveyor belts to be loaded on to individual flights.\par \par \uc2 'Basically everything of value \u8212\'20\'14 electronics, jewellery and other items \u8212\'20\'14 that could be stolen in seconds would be removed from bags,' said LA airport Police Chief \uc2 Pat Gannon\uc2 . 'They'd just open up the suitcases, rifle through them and pocket valuables.'\par \par \uc2 Police believe workers took the stolen items home and sold them, sometimes via the online marketplace \uc2 Craigslist\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The airport is still trying to determine how long the ring operated and the exact value of all the stolen property, but they suspect thousands of items were taken.\par \par \uc2 But that is scant consolation for unlucky passengers such as Mr Sampson, who have had their bags opened and their possessions stolen. Especially as, in Mr Sampson's case, \uc2 Ryanair\uc2  will not accept responsibility for what happened to his luggage.\par \par \uc2 Instead, it has pointed him to the airline's terms and conditions, which state 'valuable items' should not be carried in checked-in luggage.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Sampson says he had to check it in because his hand luggage was already filled with other, equally expensive, camera equipment.\par \par \uc2 The baggage handing company at Stansted said it did not believe any theft could have taken place there due to the speed at which the luggage came off the plane and the fact the area was covered by CCTV, while the company in Norway, from where he had taken off, denied responsibility.\par \par \uc2 'I feel that if you check in baggage with an airline, until you take it off the carousel, it is their responsibility, not mine,' Mr Sampson says.\par \par \uc2 'You expect it to be looked after \u8212\'20\'14 not for it to be returned with everything missing, then to be told no one will do anything about it.'\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140418ea4j0000h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

Norman Tebbit's as savage as ever \u8212\'20\'14 except about the wife he adores and the dog who inspired his startling new book\par \par \uc2 BY JANE FRYER\par \par \uc2 Every time Lord Tebbit looks in danger of getting a bit worked up, his wife Margaret gently interjects.\par \par \uc2 'No, Norman. Oh dear. Oh no, Norman. Don't get into that, darling. You mustn't work yourself up.'\par \par \uc2 And on each occasion, he smiles tenderly: 'OK, love. Of course.' And then presses on in his quiet, strong voice about David Cameron, the IRA, John Major, forgiveness, religion, food banks, he cost of carers and, right now, Maria Miller.\par \par \uc2 'It would have been better if they'd taken my advice in the beginning. There's a sort of nit-picking approach \u8212\'20\'14 "it was only \u163\'00\'A35,000 and she did apologise". But to me that's not the point. She was working the system. It offends against common sense.'\par \par \uc2 We are sitting in his very warm study at their beautiful home in Bury St Edmunds, sipping tea.\par \par \uc2 He, grey and stooped in slacks, beige socks and leather slippers. Margaret, immaculate in pink and grey, aloft an enormous electronic wheelchair that took four tries to get through the narrow doorway and looks like something out of Star Trek.\par \par \uc2 She has been in this chair, and others before it, since the IRA planted a bomb under a bathtub in the Grand Hotel during the 1984 Tory Party Conference at Brighton, killing five people and injuring 34, but missing their main target, Margaret Thatcher.\par \par \uc2 But right now Margaret Tebbit's terrible injuries, IRA bombs, Europe, and even the awful Tony Blair are put to one side so we can discuss a topic the Beast of Chingford is fantastically soppy about: dogs.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, he has just written a rather unlikely (but very good and surprisingly moving) children's book about a Labrador called Ben (named after their late pet Labrador) and his master, Sam, a 14-year-old boy paralysed from the waist down in a car accident.\par \par \uc2 The fictitious Ben isn't any old dog. He is a 'help' dog (linked to a real-life organisation called Canine Partners in Midhurst, West Sussex, which trains dogs to help disabled people) who can open doors, pick up clothes, helps Sam get dressed, pushes Sam's wheelchair and is a true and loyal friend.\par \par \uc2 Even better, he can also can read people's minds and communicate by placing his thoughts in their heads.\par \par \uc2 The real Ben beams out of a silver photo frame on the sideboard. 'He was just a pet, not a help dog from Canine Partners, but he was special. He really did know what I was thinking and I often knew what he was thinking,' says Norman.\par \par \uc2 'In the car, he'd stand up and paw my arm. "Master, you've taken the wrong turn".'\par \par \uc2 Today Ben, sadly put to sleep when he was 14, lies beneath a beautifully crafted headstone in their old back garden in Sussex. His last supper, to give him a good send-off, was a steak with a fried egg on top \u8212\'20\'14 'I think he knew,' says Norman.\par \par \uc2 'It reads, "Ben Tebbit. A gentleman dog." The stonemason made me add that last bit so people didn't think he was a child.' In the book Sam, the injured boy, is treated at Stoke Mandeville Hospital (where Margaret spent a year and Norman nearly three months).\par \par \uc2 'Suffering a severe injury is so much worse for a youngster. Suddenly it's all taken away and all that's left is a great big void,' says Norman.\par \par \uc2 But surely it's just the same for older people, like them? 'Yes. But it's worse if you're younger,' insists Margaret.\par \par \uc2 'Because you're less well equipped to deal with it,' adds Norman. 'And it's your whole life. At least we had . . . well, it's now less than half our married life, but for a kid . . . just awful.' Which is a typical Tebbitism.\par \par \uc2 Their bodies have been smashed to bits, their retirement vaporised, their lives are dominated by hospital appointments, catheters and carers \u8212\'20\'14 who flit in an out, pouring tea and adjusting head rests \u8212\'20\'14 but they wouldn't dream of feeling sorry for themselves.\par \par \uc2 'There are two rules of disability \u8212\'20\'14 it takes longer and it costs more,' Norman says crisply. 'We don't really go on holiday any more, it's just too difficult. But we potter around the town and have very good friends who come and stay and our three children have been marvellous.'\par \par \uc2 'And we have five grandchildren and one great-grandson,' adds Margaret.\par \par \uc2 I'd heard she wasn't well right now, but she's funny and bright \u8212\'20\'14 if occasionally struggling over a name (who doesn't?) and clearly adores Norman.\par \par \uc2 She has a calming effect on him. He seems to bask in her presence.\par \par \uc2 They can still remember every detail of the bombing. 'The last person I spoke to was the BBC journalist John Cole, outside our bedroom door. It was quite late, almost one o'clock, because we'd been at [Lord] McAlpine's soiree. And I said "I'd better get to bed".'\par \par \uc2 The blast gouged out the front of the hotel and sent the Tebbits' bed hurtling four floors down under hundreds of tonnes of masonry.\par \par \uc2 How long were they trapped? 'Ten or 12 years, it felt. But we were conscious and could talk to each other.'\par \par \uc2 'We could reach out and hold hands,' says Margaret. 'At first. But then the debris shifted and we were moved apart. We had to shout to each other in the dark.'\par \par \uc2 Did they panic? 'No point. I couldn't think of anything to panic about. There was only one question \u8212\'20\'14 would we be dug out before we died?'\par \par \uc2 Anyone over 40 will remember footage of Norman being stretchered out, ashen faced, still in his pyjamas.\par \par \uc2 'That was the remarkable thing \u8212\'20\'14 nobody seemed to be caught in the wrong bed. Everyone was fully pyjama'd at a Tory Party Conference!'\par \par \uc2 It seems light years since Tebbit's infamous 'cricket test' (he said that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who supported their native cricket teams rather than England were not sufficiently assimilated) and wrestling with trades unions and appearances on Spitting Image as the leather-jacketed Chingford Skinhead.\par \par \uc2 'If you think about it, my puppet was always winning. He was never being pushed around.' No \u8212\'20\'14 he was liquidising people's limbs and stirring his tea with cut-throat razors. 'Yes, that's right!' he squawks in delight.\par \par \uc2 He was the architect of the Thatcher era, but today some of his views seem to chime better with Ukip.\par \par \uc2 'I think Farage is a very clever political operator. He has touched on a well of public opinion,' says Norman\par \par \uc2 And has he been approached by Ukip to defect? 'Of course. Lots of times. But I joined the Conservative party in 1946 and I'm still a Conservative. And I'm not going to be pushed out of my party after 70-odd years.' Particularly not by David Cameron.\par \par \uc2 'We've only ever had two or three direct conversations. I think I'm regarded as too Thatcherite, out of touch and all that. I rubbed him up the wrong way in the run-up to the general election when I asked him why his lead was getting narrower and narrower. He got quite cross with me, which I thought was very silly.'\par \par \uc2 'Come on now, Norman. Don't get worked up again.'\par \par \uc2 'It's OK, love . . . and then I made it plain I didn't think it was wise to enter a coalition.' And now \u8212\'20\'14 does he think Cameron can win the next election?\par \par \uc2 'Well . . . I don't think it would be sensible for the Conservative Party to change its leader now. There isn't an obvious candidate. This certainly isn't what I'd call a good time for the Conservatives.\par \par \uc2 'Safe to say, we've not exactly been habituees of Number 10 in the last few years.'\par \par \uc2 'But what about that lovely party we went to?' says Margaret. 'That was the funniest, kindest party ever.'\par \par \uc2 'That was when Brown was PM,' says Norman. 'I don't join in all the attacks on Brown. I think he was essentially a decent man who was just wrong about almost everything. And unlike Blair he was not greedy.\par \par \uc2 'You don't have to acquire umpteen houses and umpteen millions of pounds. I find that just offensive. And Cherie . . . urggh.'\par \par \uc2 'But tell her about the party,' says Margaret.\par \par \uc2 'Well, we went with this bloody great wheelchair and we couldn't get it in the lift at Downing Street. Brown spent ages up and down the stairs, making sure we had drinks and people to talk to until our car came back with a smaller chair. He wasn't trying to prove anything. It was just genuine niceness.'\par \par \uc2 He is less gushing about Major.\par \par \uc2 'John's big problem was he was very prone to flattery. People would tell him what a genius he was and he'd be convinced he really had been terribly clever. Not so.'\par \par \uc2 And sceptical about Boris's chances of becoming Prime Minister. 'I love Boris dearly. I think he's a great writer and a fun person to have around, but I don't think he's got the self-discipline or focus. And there's that streak of self-indulgence.'\par \par \uc2 Not something Norman seems to possess. Aged 83, he enjoys simple pleasures \u8212\'20\'14 cooking, reading, writing, attending evensong in the local cathedral and gardening. Gently. He still has a limp from his own injuries and looks rather frail.\par \par \uc2 Because Margaret's injuries were so terrible, Norman's are often overlooked. Reluctantly, he lists them.\par \par \uc2 'Broken shoulder blade, fractured vertebrae (although I didn't find out till sometime afterwards), leg bone cracked. A lot of smacks around the face. Broken collar bone. I lost the iliac crest on the top of my left hip and all the muscle girdle across my stomach was severed, so I needed quite a bit of plastic surgery to patch it all together.'\par \par \uc2 He hated hospital. He set up a 'minister's private office' in the ward and discharged himself after only three months. Margaret was in hospital for two years \u8212\'20\'14 after a year in Stoke Mandeville she was moved to Stanmore, closer for Norman (and his minders) to visit.\par \par \uc2 'After the bombing, I was promoted by the IRA quite high up their "must kill" list. Apparently they regarded it as a bit of an affront that I hadn't done the decent thing and died in Brighton. But my minders were lovely men. A loyal and funny bunch of guys.' One of them married a nurse he met at Stoke Mandeville.\par \par \uc2 Before the bombing, Norman was fiercely ambitious and hotly tipped by many to succeed Thatcher as PM.\par \par \uc2 'I would have given it a go, but after we were injured, I promised Margaret I wouldn't carry on beyond the next election.' Would he have enjoyed life at Number 10? 'Probably. Good address. Nice garden \u8212\'20\'14 good for a dog.'\par \par \uc2 Instead, he resigned himself to commenting from the sidelines \u8212\'20\'14 regularly stirring everyone up with (sometimes outrageously) provocative Tebbitisms, such as suggesting gay marriage could lead to a lesbian Queen marrying and having a child by artificial insemination.\par \par \uc2 'I like to wind people up. I like pulling people's legs.' He recently caused outrage by claiming many people used food banks at the same times as spending money on junk food.\par \par \uc2 He still works as a newspaper columnist, after-dinner speaker, you name it, to help pay for Margaret's round-the-clock carers. The bills must have been astronomical.\par \par \uc2 'Don't get me started . . .'\par \par \uc2 There was a lump sum from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board and an anonymous fund donated by a group of people whose names he still does not know, masterminded by the late lawyer and political fixer Arnold 'Two Dinners' Goodman. Most of which is gone now, but it helped enormously.\par \par \uc2 While Norman is not one for self-pity, he is not ready to forgive.\par \par \uc2 'I will forgive them when they follow what it says in the prayer book. Firstly they have to accept that they have sinned. Secondly they have to confess their sins. Then they have to do penance. Come on! There is no penance.\par \par \uc2 'I don't know whether God exists, but it would be a good idea if he did and I would like to see him be quite active.'\par \par \uc2 'Oh Norman, don't . . .'\par \par \uc2 Then Margaret turns to me \u8212\'20\'14 or as much as a turn as you can turn when you're pinned to a wheelchair by paralysis \u8212\'20\'14 and grins lopsidedly. 'Good thing I love him so much!'\par \par \uc2 I can see why. Norman Tebbit is amazing \u8212\'20\'14 fantastically good, sharp and clever company, if rather frail of body. Whether or not you agree with his politics, it is impossible not to admire his loyalty, humanity and extraordinary strength of character.\par \par \uc2 'I don't go in a lot for "might have beens". People who say, "If only I'd done that, then this might have happened". 'Basically, they're day-dreaming, aren't they? That's not realistic. I'm a realist.'\par \par \uc2 'You've got to face facts \u8212\'20\'14 your old life isn't happening. You've got to make a new life. You have to count your blessings and move on. So we did.'\par \par \uc2 * Ben's Story will be published by Bretwalda Books in June, at \u163\'00\'A37.99.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140418ea4j0000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge opted not to take little George along on their week\u8211\'20\'13long trip to the Maldives. Bryony Gordon thinks they were wrong\par \par \uc2 It was on the 10\u8211\'20\'13hour flight to the Maldives that we started to wonder if it had been a good idea taking our 11\u8211\'20\'13month\u8211\'20\'13old baby with us on honeymoon. Another couple on board had left their young child at home, and we began to think we should have done the same.\par \par \uc2 The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, sitting at the front of our \uc2 British Airways\uc2  plane, were without Prince George, presumably blissfully relaxed as they headed off on their week\u8211\'20\'13long holiday at the Cheval Blanc resort. Back in cattle, we were dealing with a squirming, screaming baby who was hoisted out of her bassinet every time the plane hit turbulence, which was often. And we still had a sea plane to catch. Had I gone mad? If not, would I go mad? And would I need a holiday to get over our holiday?\par \par \uc2 "The Maldives is not a place to take a baby," one well\u8211\'20\'13travelled friend told me. "It's a place to MAKE a baby." We had ignored her, because how bad could it really be? It wasn't as if we were heading to Chernobyl, or North Korea. It was the Maldives, a place of myriad desert islands, white sandy beaches and turquoise waters.\par \par \uc2 And all the clich\u233\'00\'E9s had convinced us that it was the perfect destination for our long\u8211\'20\'13overdue honeymoon. Our long\u8211\'20\'13overdue honeymoon that would be gatecrashed by our baby (we married when our daughter was just 12 weeks old, and felt it hardly the best time to jet off). The thought of leaving her behind had not been an option when we booked our trip all those months ago \u8211\'20\'13 we would miss her! She would miss us! \u8211\'20\'13 but it seemed terribly appealing as she disturbed the peace of every passenger on board, the Duke and Duchess included.\par \par \uc2 Getting off the plane at Male airport, into stifling heat, I wondered again if we hadn't made a terrible mistake. The queue for security snaked to the very end of the hall, the air conditioning was broken, and the cabin crew had been so preoccupied with their royal cargo that they had forgotten to give the rest of us \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  forms, meaning a frantic scramble at the airport as my husband attempted to write them on my back and our child tried to escape back out on to the runway. "This place is hell on earth!" he said, which is the first recorded instance of those words ever being said about the Maldives.\par \par \uc2 I felt a bit like crying, but the baby started instead and I thought it would be pretty pathetic to challenge her. We got through Arrivals, clammy, tear\u8211\'20\'13stained, stinking and sleep\u8211\'20\'13deprived from the overnight flight, and were met by representatives of Soneva Fushi, the resort we were staying in. At this point things started to get better. Much better.\par \par \uc2 They checked us in right then and there, in the middle of the Arrivals hall, whisking away our bags and taking us to the resort's private lounge. We were given cold towels \u8211\'20\'13 we were never very far from a cold towel from that moment on \u8211\'20\'13 watermelon juices, and for me and my husband, shoulder massages. The baby crawled around the clean, cool floor to her heart's content, before we were whisked away to the sea plane that would take us on our 30\u8211\'20\'13minute journey to Baa Atoll. We flew over the Indian Ocean, gasping at the blue lagoons around islands, the baby mesmerised by the sound of the propeller engines. Before long we had landed at Soneva Fushi International airport \u8211\'20\'13 a pontoon floating a few hundred yards off the coast of the island. We were met by a Dhoni \u8211\'20\'13 more watermelon juice, more cold towels \u8211\'20\'13 and told to remove our shoes. We would not put them back on again for the whole week and a half we were there.\par \par \uc2 When Soneva Fushi opened 19 years ago, it was the first resort in the Maldives to embrace barefoot luxury. Run by Sonu Shivdasani, an old Etonian who counts David Cameron and Boris Johnson among his contemporaries, and his Swedish wife, Eva (Soneva is a melding of their names), it is a sort of Robinson Crusoe hideaway; the villas, with their thatched roofs, look like tree houses. We felt a bit like the Swiss Family Robinson in our open\u8211\'20\'13aired bathroom, with its shower in the garden and a bath (big enough for all three of us) that overlooked a giant water feature.\par \par \uc2 Our Mr Friday \u8211\'20\'13 all the guests get one \u8211\'20\'13 told us that the toiletries had been made from lemongrass that had been grown on the island. They grow as much as they can at Soneva Fushi \u8211\'20\'13 no mean feat given that the soils are mostly sand \u8211\'20\'13 and everything is recycled or composted in an eco centre that is best avoided if you want to keep the contents of your stomach.\par \par \uc2 In a country that threatens to sink below the waves, it felt good to be staying somewhere that took its commitment to the environment seriously.\par \par \uc2 But for us, the real sell of Soneva Fushi wasn't its eco\u8211\'20\'13credentials. It was how welcome it makes children feel. Given that the Maldives is the kind of place that couples go to get away from it all, we appreciated that. Our daughter was given her own cot, her own mosquito net, and her own set of beach toys, complete with bucket and spade. At breakfast, lunch and dinner, they would happily pur\u233\'00\'E9e any fruit she wanted, and we didn't even have to provide bibs. She was welcome at all four of the resort's restaurants and sampled sorbets from the ice cream room (there is also a chocolate room, and a cheese room, but they were for Mum and Dad only). We were even given a tricycle to ferry her around the island.\par \par \uc2 At a kilometre long by half a kilometre wide, Soneva Fushi is big by Maldivian standards, which meant we never felt as if we were bothering any of the other guests, though given that most of them were repeat visitors (at some times during the year, 70 per cent of the guests have been before), we needn't have worried. Everyone, from the restaurant staff to the housekeeper to the couple in the villa next door, was friendly and charming beyond belief.\par \par \uc2 Our daughter didn't get bored, which was a worry given that friends had warned us there would be nothing to do but sit and read. There was a beach cinema where she cackled at Despicable Me while eating tomato pasta, and she spent hours floating in our villa's pool with her armbands on. Though there was a team of childminders available to look after her while we went snorkelling, after a few days we just wanted to stay with her, watching her delighted face as she sampled this strange new world \u8211\'20\'13 a school of fish swimming next to her, or dolphins swimming past while on an early evening cruise.\par \par \uc2 Then there was the Den, an activity centre for children that was crammed full of toys and games. Later this year, a new Den will open, complete with pool, slides, zip line, dressing\u8211\'20\'13up corner and DJ room, for the teenagers. It might even be worth making a return trip.\par \par \uc2 On the flight home, our daughter slept soundly, dreaming perhaps of the wild rabbits that roamed the island, or the curry she had sampled for the first time the night before. And I knew then that the flight out had been worth it, and that it was William and Kate who had made the mistake, not us.\par \par \uc2 ITC Luxury Travel (01244 355527; itcluxurytravel.co.uk) is offering a sevennight stay at Soneva Fushi for the price of five nights, plus complimentary half board. Prices start at \u163\'00\'A32,789 per person based on two adults sharing a Crusoe Villa for seven nights on a half\u8211\'20\'13board basis, including return economy\u8211\'20\'13class flight with \uc2 British Airways\uc2  from London Gatwick and transfers. This represents a saving of up to \u163\'00\'A31,525 per person. The offer is valid for travel completed between May 12 and July 31, 2014 or September 1 and October 19.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140419ea4j000fq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw119\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1785\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Opponents of a divided Union underestimate the SNP leader at their peril\par \par \uc2 A wobble, or a game\u8211\'20\'13changer? The latest opinion polls for the Scottish independence referendum are worrisome, especially for those of us whose dislike of the potential split is matched only by the depth of our subconscious assumption \u8211\'20\'13 that Scotland would just vote No.\par \par \uc2 Don't go, Scotland, "we want you to stay": the Prime Minister spoke from his heart earlier this year. Not only Mr Cameron has taken up this plangent refrain; everyone from Nato leaders to David Bowie has been repeating the chorus of union. Yet an opinion poll "average" last week put the gap in favour of the UK at only 8 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 Whatever statistical argument I'd like to make about this modern fallacious practice (of averaging opinion polls from different organisations) \u8211\'20\'13 first of all, it's probably too dull for Saturday morning; secondly, and in any case, the majority against separatism is too small for comfort, however it's measured. \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  has spent his entire career fighting as the doughty underdog. Fighting thus, and winning.\par \par \uc2 This week, Mr Salmond accused George Osborne of "bluffing" over currency union. He was able to shrug off the killer fact that Scotland will emphatically not be part of a currency union (why would English voters tolerate Bank of England interest rates being set to assist the residents of a foreign nation?) \u8211\'20\'13 because of a recent stupid remark, made behind the scenes, by a Cabinet minister in London. "Of course there would be a [currency] union," this fool was quoted as saying.\par \par \uc2 The sheer laziness of the UK establishment's approach to the referendum astonishes me. That Cabinet minister may have cost us our country: does he realise that? Only ignorance of the ferocious nature of Salmond's campaigning style could have permitted it to pass his criminally thoughtless lips.\par \par \uc2 Those more familiar with the SNP leader would have known that he would pounce on this gift, and use it to disarm one of Unionism's most potent weapons. From now on, whenever the No campaign makes the point \u8211\'20\'13 that separatists cannot say which currency an independent Scotland would use, and, worse, how that currency would be managed \u8211\'20\'13 Salmond will let loose one of his bombastic, alliterative sentences, to deny there's a problem at all.\par \par \uc2 The rhetoric of the SNP's leader grates on my ear as much as does that of his English Nationalist alter ego, Nigel Farage. (Ukip and the SNP are two sides of the same toxic coin, the one that would buy entry to nationalist, separatist paradises. Cost: the UK as we know it.) But it's worth pointing out the difficult fact: the reason I dislike Salmond's rhetoric is that he uses it to such excellent demotic effect.\par \par \uc2 I've spent my entire adult life waiting for his separatist bubble to burst. It never has. The Salmond bubble becomes only larger, and shinier, and more (seemingly) impregnable, with every electoral cycle that passes. That's why he bugs me.\par \par \uc2 I fear Mr Salmond is being similarly underestimated by the No campaign. Such a miscalculation, if it persists, will be fatal. The poets of Union \u8211\'20\'13 men such as our great novelist Allan Massie \u8211\'20\'13 must displace the grey facts of Darling. And there must be complete verbal discipline from every opponent of separatism.\par \par \uc2 I'm writing this in a caf\u233\'00\'E9 at the top of a street that reaches down to the sea \u8211\'20\'13 far from Scotland, but not really far at all. A very British scene, one found in seaside towns all round our small island.\par \par \uc2 On September 18 it might just dissolve into foreign\u8211\'20\'13ness, along with my dual Scottish and British identity. That will happen, unless the No campaign improves the quality of its work. Well, Easter is a fitting time for renewal.\par \par \uc2 There's a role for London's commentariat, too, which dances to Ukip's drum, devoting pages of discussion to eastern European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , rather than the instant \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from Scotland that will result from a Yes vote. There are thousands of people like me, born north of the border but living south of it, whose potential relabelling as "foreigner" nobody appears to have noticed.\par \par \uc2 We commentators prefer to discuss the EU referendum over the Scottish one, not noticing that the EU vote won't happen unless the Tories win the next election, while the Scottish vote will certainly occur. Furthermore, unless the Scottish separatists are defeated, we can't even define the electorate for the 2017 vote on Europe.\par \par \uc2 Suddenly, lots of the rocks \u8211\'20\'13 the ones that support our settled view of life \u8211\'20\'13 appear to be crumbling. When we wake up, and find the borders quite redrawn, our mental maps will no longer work. We won't know the way home, since "home" \u8211\'20\'13 the United Kingdom \u8211\'20\'13 might no longer be there to find.\par \par \uc2 Comment on Graeme Archer's view at telegraph.co.uk/personalview\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140419ea4j0007m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw142\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2130\pichgoal600

Oh dear. Oh no, Norman. Don\u8217\'20\'19t get into that, darling. You mustn\u8217\'20\'19t work yourself up.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 And on each occasion, he smiles tenderly: \u8216\'20\'18OK, love. Of course.\u8217\'20\'19 And then presses on in his quiet, strong voice about David Cameron, the IRA, John Major, forgiveness, religion, food banks, the cost of carers and, right now, Maria Miller.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It would have been better if they\u8217\'20\'19d taken my advice in the beginning. There\u8217\'20\'19s a sort of nit-picking approach \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1Cit was only \u163\'00\'A35,000 and she did apologise\u8221\'20\'1D. But to me that\u8217\'20\'19s not the point. She was working the system. It offends against common sense.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 We are sitting in his very warm study at their beautiful home in Bury St Edmunds, sipping tea.\par \par \uc2 He, grey and stooped in slacks, beige socks and leather slippers. Margaret, immaculate in pink and grey, aloft an enormous electronic wheelchair that took four tries to get through the narrow doorway and looks like something out of Star Trek.\par \par \uc2 She has been in this chair, and others before it, since the IRA planted a bomb under a bathtub in the Grand Hotel during the 1984 Tory Party Conference at Brighton, killing five people and injuring 34, but missing their main target, Margaret Thatcher.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 But right now Margaret Tebbit\u8217\'20\'19s terrible injuries, IRA bombs, Europe, and even the awful Tony Blair are put to one side so we can discuss a topic the Beast of Chingford is fantastically soppy about: dogs.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, he has just written a rather unlikely (but very good and surprisingly moving) children\u8217\'20\'19s book about a Labrador called Ben (named after their late pet Labrador) and his master, Sam, a 14-year-old boy paralysed from the waist down in a car accident.\par \par \uc2 The fictitious Ben isn\u8217\'20\'19t any old dog. He is a \u8216\'20\'18help\u8217\'20\'19 dog (linked to a real-life organisation called Canine Partners in Midhurst, West Sussex, which trains dogs to help disabled people) who can open doors, pick up clothes, helps Sam get dressed, pushes Sam\u8217\'20\'19s wheelchair and is a true and loyal friend.\par \par \uc2 Even better, he can also can read people\u8217\'20\'19s minds and communicate by placing his thoughts in their heads.\par \par \uc2 The real Ben beams out of a silver photo frame on the sideboard. \u8216\'20\'18He was just a pet, not a help dog from Canine Partners, but he was special. He really did know what I was thinking and I often knew what he was thinking,\u8217\'20\'19 says Norman.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18In the car, he\u8217\'20\'19d stand up and paw my arm. \u8220\'20\'1CMaster, you\u8217\'20\'19ve taken the wrong turn\u8221\'20\'1D.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Today Ben, sadly put to sleep when he was 14, lies beneath a beautifully crafted headstone in their old back garden in Sussex. His last supper, to give him a good send-off, was a steak with a fried egg on top \u8212\'20\'14 \u8216\'20\'18I think he knew,\u8217\'20\'19 says Norman.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It reads, \u8220\'20\'1CBen Tebbit. A gentleman dog.\u8221\'20\'1D The stonemason made me add that last bit so people didn\u8217\'20\'19t think he was a child.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 In the book Sam, the injured boy, is treated at Stoke Mandeville Hospital (where Margaret spent a year and Norman nearly three months).\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Suffering a severe injury is so much worse for a youngster. Suddenly it\u8217\'20\'19s all taken away and all that\u8217\'20\'19s left is a great big void,\u8217\'20\'19 says Norman.\par \par \uc2 But surely it\u8217\'20\'19s just the same for older people, like them? \u8216\'20\'18Yes. But it\u8217\'20\'19s worse if you\u8217\'20\'19re younger,\u8217\'20\'19 insists Margaret.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Because you\u8217\'20\'19re less well equipped to deal with it,\u8217\'20\'19 adds Norman. \u8216\'20\'18And it\u8217\'20\'19s your whole life. At least we had.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. well, it\u8217\'20\'19s now less than half our married life, but for a kid.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. just awful.\u8217\'20\'19 Which is a typical Tebbitism.\par \par \uc2 Their bodies have been smashed to bits, their retirement vaporised, their lives are dominated by hospital appointments, catheters and carers \u8212\'20\'14 who flit in an out, pouring tea and adjusting head rests \u8212\'20\'14 but they wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t dream of feeling sorry for themselves.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18There are two rules of disability \u8212\'20\'14 it takes longer and it costs more,\u8217\'20\'19 Norman says crisply. \u8216\'20\'18We don\u8217\'20\'19t really go on holiday any more, it\u8217\'20\'19s just too difficult. But we potter around the town and have very good friends who come and stay and our three children have been marvellous.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18And we have five grandchildren and one great-grandson,\u8217\'20\'19 adds Margaret.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19d heard she wasn\u8217\'20\'19t well right now, but she\u8217\'20\'19s funny and bright \u8212\'20\'14 if occasionally struggling over a name (who doesn\u8217\'20\'19t?) and clearly adores Norman.\par \par \uc2 She has a calming effect on him. He seems to bask in her presence.\par \par \uc2 They can still remember every detail of the bombing. \u8216\'20\'18The last person I spoke to was the BBC journalist John Cole, outside our bedroom door. It was quite late, almost one o\u8217\'20\'19clock, because we\u8217\'20\'19d been at [Lord] McAlpine\u8217\'20\'19s soiree. And I said \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19d better get to bed\u8221\'20\'1D.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 The blast gouged out the front of the hotel and sent the Tebbits\u8217\'20\'19 bed hurtling four floors down under hundreds of tonnes of masonry.\par \par \uc2 How long were they trapped? \u8216\'20\'18Ten or 12 years, it felt. But we were conscious and could talk to each other.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18We could reach out and hold hands,\u8217\'20\'19 says Margaret. \u8216\'20\'18At first. But then the debris shifted and we were moved apart. We had to shout to each other in the dark.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Did they panic? \u8216\'20\'18No point. I couldn\u8217\'20\'19t think of anything to panic about. There was only one question \u8212\'20\'14 would we be dug out before we died?\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Anyone over 40 will remember footage of Norman being stretchered out, ashen faced, still in his pyjamas.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18That was the remarkable thing \u8212\'20\'14 nobody seemed to be caught in the wrong bed. Everyone was fully pyjama\u8217\'20\'19d at a Tory Party Conference!\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 It seems light years since Tebbit\u8217\'20\'19s infamous \u8216\'20\'18cricket test\u8217\'20\'19 (he said that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who supported their native cricket teams rather than England were not sufficiently assimilated) and wrestling with trades unions and appearances on Spitting Image as the leather-jacketed Chingford Skinhead.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18If you think about it, my puppet was always winning. He was never being pushed around.\u8217\'20\'19 No \u8212\'20\'14 he was liquidising people\u8217\'20\'19s limbs and stirring his tea with cut-throat razors. \u8216\'20\'18Yes, that\u8217\'20\'19s right!\u8217\'20\'19 he squawks in delight.\par \par \uc2 He was the architect of the Thatcher era, but today some of his views seem to chime better with Ukip.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I think Farage is a very clever political operator. He has touched on a well of public opinion,\u8217\'20\'19 says Norman.\par \par \uc2 And has he been approached by Ukip to defect? \u8216\'20\'18Of course. Lots of times. But I joined the Conservative party in 1946 and I\u8217\'20\'19m still a Conservative. And I\u8217\'20\'19m not going to be pushed out of my party after 70-odd years.\u8217\'20\'19 Particularly not by David Cameron.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18We\u8217\'20\'19ve only ever had two or three direct conversations. I think I\u8217\'20\'19m regarded as too Thatcherite, out of touch and all that. I rubbed him up the wrong way in the run-up to the general election when I asked him why his lead was getting narrower and narrower. He got quite cross with me, which I thought was very silly.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Come on now, Norman. Don\u8217\'20\'19t get worked up again.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It\u8217\'20\'19s OK, love.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. and then I made it plain I didn\u8217\'20\'19t think it was wise to enter a coalition.\u8217\'20\'19 And now \u8212\'20\'14 does he think Cameron can win the next election?\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Well.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. I don\u8217\'20\'19t think it would be sensible for the Conservative Party to change its leader now. There isn\u8217\'20\'19t an obvious candidate. This certainly isn\u8217\'20\'19t what I\u8217\'20\'19d call a good time for the Conservatives.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Safe to say, we\u8217\'20\'19ve not exactly been habituees of Number 10 in the last few years.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18But what about that lovely party we went to?\u8217\'20\'19 says Margaret. \u8216\'20\'18That was the funniest, kindest party ever.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18That was when Brown was PM,\u8217\'20\'19 says Norman. \u8216\'20\'18I don\u8217\'20\'19t join in all the attacks on Brown. I think he was essentially a decent man who was just wrong about almost everything. And unlike Blair he was not greedy.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18You don\u8217\'20\'19t have to acquire umpteen houses and umpteen millions of pounds. I find that just offensive. And Cherie\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09urggh.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18But tell her about the party,\u8217\'20\'19 says Margaret.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Well, we went with this bloody great wheelchair and we couldn\u8217\'20\'19t get it in the lift at Downing Street. Brown spent ages up and down the stairs, making sure we had drinks and people to talk to until our car came back with a smaller chair. He wasn\u8217\'20\'19t trying to prove anything. It was just genuine niceness.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 He is less gushing about Major.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18John\u8217\'20\'19s big problem was he was very prone to flattery. People would tell him what a genius he was and he\u8217\'20\'19d be convinced he really had been terribly clever. Not so.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 And sceptical about Boris\u8217\'20\'19s chances of becoming Prime Minister. \u8216\'20\'18I love Boris dearly. I think he\u8217\'20\'19s a great writer and a fun person to have around, but I don\u8217\'20\'19t think he\u8217\'20\'19s got the self-discipline or focus. And there\u8217\'20\'19s that streak of self-indulgence.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Not something Norman seems to possess.\u160\'00\'A0 Aged 83, he enjoys simple pleasures \u8212\'20\'14 cooking, reading, writing, attending evensong in the local cathedral and gardening. Gently. He still has a limp from his own injuries and looks rather frail.\par \par \uc2 Because Margaret\u8217\'20\'19s injuries were so terrible, Norman\u8217\'20\'19s are often overlooked. Reluctantly, he lists them.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Broken shoulder blade, fractured vertebrae (although I didn\u8217\'20\'19t find out till sometime afterwards), leg bone cracked. A lot of smacks around the face. Broken collar bone. I lost the iliac crest on the top of my left hip and all the muscle girdle across my stomach was severed, so I needed quite a bit of plastic surgery to patch it all together.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 He hated hospital. He set up a \u8216\'20\'18minister\u8217\'20\'19s private office\u8217\'20\'19 in the ward and discharged himself after only three months. Margaret was in hospital for two years \u8212\'20\'14 after a year in Stoke Mandeville she was moved to Stanmore, closer for Norman (and his minders) to visit.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18After the bombing, I was promoted by the IRA quite high up their \u8220\'20\'1Cmust kill\u8221\'20\'1D list. Apparently they regarded it as a bit of an affront that I hadn\u8217\'20\'19t done the decent thing and died in Brighton. But my minders were lovely men. A loyal and funny bunch of guys.\u8217\'20\'19 One of them married a nurse he met at Stoke Mandeville.\par \par \uc2 Before the bombing, Norman was fiercely ambitious and hotly tipped by many to succeed Thatcher as PM.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I would have given it a go, but after we were injured, I promised Margaret I wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t carry on beyond the next election.\u8217\'20\'19 Would he have enjoyed life at Number 10? \u8216\'20\'18Probably. Good address. Nice garden \u8212\'20\'14 good for a dog.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Instead, he resigned himself to commenting from the sidelines \u8212\'20\'14 regularly stirring everyone up with (sometimes outrageously) provocative Tebbitisms, such as suggesting gay marriage could lead to a lesbian Queen marrying and having a child by artificial insemination.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I like to wind people up. I like pulling people\u8217\'20\'19s legs.\u8217\'20\'19 He recently caused outrage by claiming many people used food banks at the same times as spending money on junk food.\par \par \uc2 He still works as a newspaper columnist, after-dinner speaker, you name it, to help pay for Margaret\u8217\'20\'19s round-the-clock carers. The bills must have been astronomical.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Don\u8217\'20\'19t get me started.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 There was a lump sum from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board and an anonymous fund donated by a group of people whose names he still does not know, masterminded by the late lawyer and political fixer Arnold \u8216\'20\'18Two Dinners\u8217\'20\'19 Goodman.

\par\par \uc2 Editorial; Opinion, Columns\par \b \uc2 Why couldn't we have had a sensible debate about sexism?\b0\par\par\uc2 Archie Bland   \par \uc2 773 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 April 2014\par \uc2 Belfast Telegraph\par \uc2 WBEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 24\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent News & Media (Northern Ireland)   \par \par \uc2 saturday view\par \par \uc2 There are straw men being erected everywhere. They are not difficult to knock down. But they are sturdily made and straw does not degrade quickly, so their prone forms litter the political landscape, getting in the way.\par \par \uc2 Consider the suggestion that Britain is "the most sexist country in the world". This, we have been told, is how visiting UN special rapporteur Rashida Manjoo described us when summing up her 16-day visit.\par \par \uc2 She may have reason to regret it. When the last UN rapporteur who visited had the temerity to criticise the bedroom tax, Raquel Rolnik, who is from Sao Paulo, found herself described as 'loopy' ' and a Marxist 'Brazil nut'', who had once practised animal sacrifice. If this form is anything to go by, we can expect to hear more about Ms Manjoo soon.\par \par \uc2 The thing is, whatever headline writers and the online outraged are claiming, Ms Manjoo did not say that Britain was the most sexist country in the world. What she said was this: "Have I seen this level of sexist culture in other countries? It hasn't been so in your face in other countries. I haven't seen that so pervasively in other countries. I'm sure it exists, but it wasn't so much and so pervasive."\par \par \uc2 The other countries, it is important to bear in mind, are not all 192 UN member states, but the six that she has already visited as part of her work on violence against women.\par \par \uc2 I still disagree with her statement. Those countries include Bangladesh, Somalia and Kyrgyzstan and even if one acknowledges that Ms Manjoo's observation was limited to sexist culture (as opposed to sexism as a complete system), it seems a bit much.\par \par \uc2 The full quote of Ms Manjoo's that I reproduced above is 42 words long, the bastardised version of it that has done the rounds only seven. But at her Press conference on Tuesday, she read a 4,000-word diagnosis of gender inequality in Britain today and then took questions.\par \par \uc2 She pointed out that she was denied access to Yarl's Wood, an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  detention centre for women, that has faced heavy criticism for the way it treats its inmates.\par \par \uc2 One might have hoped that Ms Manjoo's intervention would have helped to focus our attention on these significant matters. Instead, the argument has been dominated by those who consider her presence a diplomatic insult so grave that it overrides all considerations.\par \par \uc2 One blogger argued that the country is a 'gynocracy'', because we've had a queen since 1952. Once the 'most sexist country' ' line had taken hold, even those responses that acknowledged the existence of sexism often did so in a tone that seemed to long for this awful UN woman to go home and leave us in peace.\par \par \uc2 It doesn't really matter, now, whether one thinks Britain is the most sexist country in the world, or not. The point is that anyone who is interested has been forced to take a position on this concocted accusation and its accuracy as a paraphrase, instead of talking about anything that matters.\par \par \uc2 The state of British gender relations becomes a problem that only matters insofar as it dictates our position in some abstract international pecking order.\par \par \uc2 Thus another opportunity for having a proper debate about the position of women in this country, without reference to whether, or not, women in Saudi Arabia are allowed to drive, goes past.\par \par \uc2 I suppose we shouldn't be surprised. When the 140-character version is the only one that counts, this happens all the time.\par \par \uc2 It happened when Raquel Rolnik visited and we all got obsessed with favelas. It happens when the increasing necessity of food banks is in the news and all anyone can talk about is whether it matters if the child on the Daily Mirror's front page is actually American.\par \par \uc2 By the time we''ve finished arguing, we''ve forgotten why we started. And, sure enough, here I am, rabbiting on about exactly the topic that I think is beside the point.\par \par \uc2 This is how it is with straw men. You'll be trying to make sense of something and, for a second, you'll think you've caught a clear glimpse of the horizon, but then you'll notice another of the buggers practically on top of you. Even if you get out of its way, you'll still find your view obstructed when it hits the ground.\par \par \uc2 'We forgot what we were arguing about'\par \par \uc2 Document WBEL000020140419ea4j0004l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw160\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2400\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 "I'm still not sure I really feel like a movie star"\b0\par\par\uc2 Francesca Steele   \par \uc2 1,428 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 April 2014\par \uc2 Belfast Telegraph\par \uc2 WBEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 34,35\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent News & Media (Northern Ireland)   \par \par \uc2 INTERVIEW Hollywood favourite Chiwetel Ejiofor tells Francesca Steele about his new film and how his life has changed since 12 Years a Slave\par \par \uc2 The man catapulted to Hollywood superstardom on the back of this year''s Best Picture Oscar-winner 12 Years a Slave is a master of inscrutability. An actor known for his extraordinary ability to convey endless layers of emotion in a single, quiet glance, off-screen he is peculiarly indecipherable, controlled, his face a closed book. Unless he is talking about the Nigerian Civil War \u8212\'20\'14 the subject of his latest film, Half of a Yellow Sun, and a subject close to his heart he answers with a determined politeness, segueing neatly wherever possible away from the emotional or anecdotal and into the professional. "As a child, I was just never that interested in the lives of my favourite actors, like Cary Grant. I do wonder whether knowing too much about someone''s personal life interrupts an audience''s ability to suspend disbelief, to really invest in the characters. My preference would always be that people engage with the work."\par \par \uc2 " He steadfastly refuses to talk about the Bond rumours too (Variety reported this week that he is in line to play the villain in the next Bond film, to be directed by Sam Mendes), though he is so very adamant about not discussing it, that it seems there must be something not to discuss. "I don't want to talk about that." Does he have a favourite Bond villain? "I can''t talk about that." That''s not a denial then? A stern gaze.\par \par \uc2 Who can blame him? After steadily, solidly, building a very respectable career in Hollywood for years, and an even more acclaimed one back home in London''s West End, this last year has seen a serious gear-shift for the 36-year-old. There has been a surge of interest in his professional and personal life, including paparazzi snaps of him and his long-term girlfriend, the Canadian model, Sari Mercer, doing ordinary things like shopping, something he had not really experienced before (although he was "not surprised"). The moment Steve McQueen''s brutal slavery epic 12 Years a Slave premiered at the Telluride and Toronto Film Festivals last year, Ejiofor was considered a shoo-in for the Best Actor Oscar nomination, and, by many, for the Oscar itself.\par \par \uc2 He lost, of course, to Matthew Mc-Conaughey for his portrayal of an Aids victim in Dallas Buyers Club \u8212\'20\'14 an admirable performance, though for many still inferior to Ejiofor''s towering embodiment of Solomon Northup, the kidnapped freeman sold into slavery. As it happens, Ejiofor did his first proper film with Mc-Conaughey, in 1997, when he was plucked from obscurity at drama school to appear in Steven Spielberg''s Amistad. "The Oscars night was great because Matthew and I hadn''t seen each other since then, so we got to chat and catch up."\par \par \uc2 " Did they say anything about the award? "Well, yes, I said congratulations to him." What did he say? "Oh, you know, I think he said something similar to me. Congratulations. It was a great performance he put in in Dallas Buyers Club, it really was. And it's not a competition ..."\par \par \uc2 " It is a competition, though, isn't it? I mean, someone has to win. "Well, it all depends on how you look at it." He did, however, walk away with the Bafta several weeks earlier, of which he is enormously proud.\par \par \uc2 It''s strange, given how reluctant Ejiofor seems to talk about himself, that his next project relates so strongly to his family background and the major events that have shaped his life. Half of a Yellow Sun, a beautifully shot romantic drama, is based on the book by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, which won the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2007. It is set during the Nigerian Civil War, or Biafran War, which took place during 1967 and 1970, seven years after the end of British colonial rule, as south-eastern Nigerian provinces tried to break off to form the Republic of Biafra. Ejiofor plays a revolutionary professor, Odenigbo, who is caught up in the war along with English-educated twin sisters, idealistic Olanna (Thandie Newton) and business-minded Kainene (Anika Noni Rose). They are Igbo, one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa, millions of whom were massacred in the conflict.\par \par \uc2 " Ejiofor's own family hails from Nigeria, although he grew up in London, after his parents fled Africa in the Sixties. "My grandparents were about the same age as the characters in the book and film during the war. My grandfather is very similar in some ways to Odenigbo. He was an Igbo accountant, they were both professionals, both fleeing from village to village when the Nigerian forces tried to crush Biafra."\par \par \uc2 When the Nigerian-born playwright Biyi Bandele, a friend of Ejiofor, decided to adapt and direct Half of a Yellow Sun, Ejiofor jumped at the chance to be involved. The film has "connective tissue" with 12 Years, he adds. "The last day on set in Nigeria I went to the slavery museum in Calabar, the port city where lots of slaves left the African continent. The next day I headed off to New Orleans for pre-production on 12 Years. It was pretty fascinating, in a horrible way, to think that that was the journey many of Solomon''s peers took."\par \par \uc2 Ejiofor has a complicated relationship with his homeland: beyond historic tragedy, there is a personal one too. When he was young his family returned regularly to Nigeria on holiday. It was there, when back for a family wedding, that his father, Arinze, died suddenly in a car accident, aged 39.\par \par \uc2 Ejiofor was just 11 and in the car when it happened. He was in a coma for 10 weeks. When he came to he was informed that his father was dead. "It was all a blur. After that I didn''t visit Nigeria again for four years. I think I came to associate it with Dad''s death. But then when I was 19, I travelled round from Accra to Lagos, on my own, and my perception of the country changed again."\par \par \uc2 " Ejiofor's own childhood was spent in Crystal Palace, South-East London. Arinze, before his death, and his wife, Obiajulu, a pharmacist, worked all hours to send the children to private school. "Chiwe" joined his brother at the prestigious Dulwich College. The National Youth Theatre followed at 17, and then a scholarship to London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, which he left after three months for Amistad.\par \par \uc2 He might only just have become a household name \u8212\'20\'14 "I'"I'm still not sure I feel like a movie star" \u8212\'20\'14 but his awards cabinet is already chock-block, even without the Oscar. He won Best Actor at the British Independent Film Awards playing a Nigerian doctor opposite Audrey Tautou in Stephen Frears''s 2002 thriller Dirty Pretty Things (Frears called him "phenomenal") and a Laurence Olivier Award for his praised lead in Michael Grandage''s Othello at the Donmar Warehouse in 2008. An OBE followed shortly after. He also has five Golden Globe nominations.\par \par \uc2 He has been married to Keira Knightley in Love Actually, been an \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 ' ' rights activist in Children of Men, and an American geologist in the blockbuster disaster movie 2012. He has rubbed shoulders with Angelina Jolie in Salt, and his performances in thrillers Inside Man and American Gangster were so good they led Denzel Washington, who was in both, to joke that he''d like to have him assassinated.\par \par \uc2 Next up is Z for Zachariah, a dystopian piece starring Chris Pine and Wolf of Wall Street star Margot Robbie, in which Ejiofor plays Loomis, a cold, calculating scientist.\par \par \uc2 These days he has mostly decamped to Los Angeles with Sari, although he still keeps a flat in London, and a houseboat. He doesn''t really mind the paparazzi intrusion, he insists. And anyway, it''s more than outweighed by the benefits: "The biggest change since 12 Years has been work-wise really. I feel that I don''t have to wait around for good scripts anymore, that I can get things moving more quickly. I can ring up directors I like and say I''m keen to work with them, which is great."\par \par \uc2 " Like Sam Mendes? "I couldn't say."\par \par \uc2 Half of a Yellow Sun is on release in cinemas now\par \par \uc2 Document WBEL000020140418ea4j000dd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Fame, but no fortune, from pounds 100 survival experiment: Mixed fortunes of Polish MP who tried to live like an \uc2 immigrant\uc2  in London\b0\par\par\uc2 Esther Addley   \par \uc2 858 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 April 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 On a noisy pavement next to the Earls Court exhibition centre in London, two Polish-Australian documentary-makers are filming a Russian TV crew filming the Guardian's photographer as she urges Artur Debski to loosen his crossed arms and smile a bit. A couple of pedestrians glance as they pass but, not spotting a face they recognise, hurry onwards with an impatient tut.\par \par \uc2 The 45-year-old Polish MP may not be a celebrity, but a fortnight after he landed in the UK he is in so much demand that his two phones buzz continually throughout our meeting. "Journalists," he says. "I get 100 calls a day. But this is good. This is meant to be a provocation."\par \par \uc2 Debski was criticised as a publicity-seeker when reports first emerged that he had come to London to live like a Polish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , with a plan to pick up casual work and survive on pounds 100 a week. The politician, a member of the liberal opposition party Twoj Ruch (Your Movement), is happy with that. "In Poland, 70% of young people are thinking about emigration. Last year more people died than were born. This is very dangerous for our country.\par \par \uc2 "People in Poland are calling me stupid, but at least now we are talking about it. BBC, Der Spiegel, Hong Kong TV - everybody in the world is now talking about this problem for Poland."\par \par \uc2 At the time of the last census, in 2011, there were 579,000 Polish-born people in the UK. Debski decided to ask some of them what to do about the brain drain. "I put a message on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 : 'Who lives in London?' I got 20, maybe 50 answers from Polish people: 'What do you need?'" Four days later, on 5 April, he flew to Stansted where "this guy I met on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 " greeted him and took him to his house in Poplar, east London. The MP spent his first night sleeping on a mattress in his new friend's tiny single bedroom.\par \par \uc2 The next day he met a Polish woman who offered him two nights in her house in Wandsworth, south London, for pounds 28 all in. He tried a jobcentre but didn't get far. A trip to see a contact in Ealing, in the west of the city, brought five names and numbers. One of them yielded six days' work in a Polish-owned accountancy office in Harrow, in the capital's northern suburbs - "four days with a computer, two days with a hammer," Debski says.\par \par \uc2 His first week's payment was pounds 284.95, which was handy, as his pounds 100-a-week plan had been jettisoned pretty quickly. ("It's not possible! We stopped that experiment by day three.") He plans to return home on 22 April.\par \par \uc2 Emigration was never an option when Debski was a young man, he says. At 16 he ran away from home to escape an alcoholic father and went to Warsaw where he started two businesses "buying and selling". He was 20 when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. "For young people, this was a big chance, and I took this chance. I went to China and bought items and sold them in Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Lithuania." He now sells to 5,000 outlets of the Polish equivalent of pound shops. Has he made a lot of money? "Yes." But it is much harder now, he says.\par \par \uc2 How can a rich entrepreneur persuade Poles to stay, or to return - aren't they just trying to make their way in life like he did? "Those who want to go back will go back, those who don't, won't." The important thing, he says, is for Polish politicians to learn from the experience of emigres who have made successful businesses abroad, and to liberalise the Polish economy pronto to help create those conditions at home.\par \par \uc2 "I tell these people, help me, we must change our country together. Now. Today. The government doesn't help. We must help. For the next generation."\par \par \uc2 He envies the pounds 2,000 tax cut for small businesses in the UK, and thinks jobcentres are much more efficient here than back home. What else? Draconian Polish drug laws need to be lifted, he thinks, and the favoured, tax-free status of the Catholic church must be challenged.\par \par \uc2 It doesn't sound like a comprehensive market liberalisation policy, though in fairness his limited English doesn't help. "Every day I am here I talk to my [party leader] and my partners in Poland, and we have ideas. This is the first step to starting the discussion in the Polish parliament."\par \par \uc2 pounds 28\par \par \uc2 The price of a two-night stay Debski was offered in Wandsworth.\par \par \uc2 'Emigration was never an option when I was young'\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Artur Debski, the Polish MP trying to live like an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  in London on pounds 100 a week, says: 'It's not possible!'

\par\par \uc2 Voices\par \b \uc2 Letters: Creating new schools gives parents real choice\b0\par\par\uc2 Letters   \par \uc2 1,474 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 April 2014\par 19:30\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 These letters appear in the Saturday 19th April edition of the Independent\par \par \uc2 Jane Merrick (\u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s two decades since \u8216\'20\'18education, education, education\u8217\'20\'19, but still Britain\u8217\'20\'19s primary school admissions are a farce\u8221\'20\'1D, 17 April) made two contradictory points.\par \par \uc2 She argues that parents need to be provided with more choice, while also criticising the Government for setting up free schools in areas with a surplus of places. She can\u8217\'20\'19t have it both ways. While there is a clear need to address the shortage of places, this does not by itself increase choice. It is only by creating new schools and new school places across the country that we can provide a genuine choice for parents. We are confronting both of these challenges.\par \par \uc2 We have made an additional \u163\'00\'A35bn of funding available in this parliament alone to councils to create new school places \u8211\'20\'13 double the amount spent by the previous government over the same period \u8211\'20\'13 leading to the creation of 260,000 new school places by May 2013, with many more in the pipeline.\par \par \uc2 We are also allowing good schools to expand without the restrictions and bureaucracy they faced in the past. Nearly 80 per cent of new primary places created are in good or outstanding schools and, thanks to our reforms, the number of children in failing secondary schools has already fallen by a quarter of a million since 2010.\par \par \uc2 We have opened more than 170 free schools for 80,000 pupils, and the vast majority are in areas facing a shortage of school places or are in deprived communities. They are proving hugely popular with parents \u8211\'20\'13 attracting almost three applications for every available place \u8211\'20\'13 and offer good value for money.\par \par \uc2 We are building schools at a fraction of the cost of the former government\u8217\'20\'19s Building Schools for the Future programme.\par \par \uc2 Ensuring enough school places for the growing population is one of our top priorities. Most councils are on track towards creating enough places, with 212,000 new primary places created between May 2010 and May 2013. There are no easy solutions, but this Government has made great strides in driving up the number and quality\u160\'00\'A0 of places.\par \par \uc2 David Laws, Minister of State for Schools, London SW1\par \par \uc2 Jane Merrick aims at the wrong targets when she says parents haven\u8217\'20\'19t truly been given \u8220\'20\'1Cchoice\u8221\'20\'1D over which schools their children can attend. If all schools were capable of educating our children to a high standard, there would be no need to have any notion, however spurious, of \u8220\'20\'1Cchoice\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 That our schools are not in a position to do this is down to the failure of successive governments which, instead of being accountable for this negligence, promote a specious concept of parental choice as a smokescreen to hide behind.\par \par \uc2 As Merrick correctly points out, no such choice exists, yet parents are led to believe it is they, rather than the Government, who have failed their children.\par \par \uc2 Michael O\u8217\'20\'19Hare, Northwood, London\par \par \uc2 Church has a role\u160\'00\'A0 to play in state\par \par \uc2 The arguments Mary Dejevsky deploys to urge a separation between Church and State fail to convince (\u8220\'20\'1CIf Cameron is invoking God to make his party appear less nasty, then he really hasn\u8217\'20\'19t a prayer\u8221\'20\'1D,\u160\'00\'A0 17 April).\par \par \uc2 She mentions the diplomatic minefields such as a PM converting to Catholicism, but we have managed to navigate these and other instances with aplomb over hundreds of years. Then she cites the diversity of the population, but many non-Christian faith groups support the current set-up. They reason that religion in the UK is protected through an established church, with the Church of England providing a buffer for this.\par \par \uc2 And in relation to the spats between the Archbishops of Canterbury and governments, these are a sign of a healthy democracy. Faith leaders should have a voice in the public debate, just as much as other civil society leaders, though they must be sensitive to the fact that this brings no automatic entitlement to shape laws.\par \par \uc2 Zaki Cooper, Trustee, Council of Christians and Jews, London NW4\par \par \uc2 Excerpts from The Gospel According to David Cameron for Easter:\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CConsider the lilies of the field. They do not labour or spin. Typical of the something-for-nothing culture we are determined to end.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAnd he welcomed the moneylenders into the Temple \u8211\'20\'13 and gave them all huge bonuses.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is easier for Eric Pickles to go through the eye of a needle than for \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 , \uc2 Google\uc2  and Amazon to pay corporation tax.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAnd he said unto the leper: \u8216\'20\'18Atos says you\u8217\'20\'19re fit to work. We\u8217\'20\'19re taking you off disability benefits.\u8217\'20\'19\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere are many mansions in my heavenly father\u8217\'20\'19s house, but if you\u8217\'20\'19re on benefits, in council accommodation and have a spare room, we\u8217\'20\'19ll hit you with the bedroom tax.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLove thy neighbour as thyself \u8211\'20\'13 unless they\u8217\'20\'19re a Bulgarian or Romanian \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Sasha Simic, London N16\par \par \uc2 What is it that David Cameron does or refrains from doing because of his Christian faith? Without being clear about that, surely his profession of faith is meaningless? \u8220\'20\'1CFaith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead\u8221\'20\'1D (James 2:17).\par \par \uc2 Mark Walford, London N12\par \par \uc2 Whatever happened\u160\'00\'A0 to progress?\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19ve just finished re-reading a book that was given to me by my mother on my 16th birthday. It was published in 1914 and tells a story of poverty wages, starvation, charities providing essentials, short-time contracts, zero hours, corrupt businesses that own politicians and vice-versa, and an apathetic population who mistakenly vote for their own drudgery.\par \par \uc2 They only want \u8220\'20\'1Cplenty of work\u8221\'20\'1D and are encouraged to live a vicarious existence, marvelling at the antics of the rich and famous. We haven\u8217\'20\'19t advanced much in 100 years have we? The book? The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists by Robert Tressell.\par \par \uc2 Martin Carty, Aldridge, Walsall\par \par \uc2 Music can thrill without being painful\par \par \uc2 Chris Maume (\u8220\'20\'1CIt isn\u8217\'20\'19t a proper rock gig if you don\u8217\'20\'19t leave with your ears ringing\u8221\'20\'1D, 17 April) may be being deliberately provocative, but to believe that rock music has to be painfully loud is stupid.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps groups play so loudly in order to drown out the moronic shouting and whistling which seems to accompany every gig I hear on the radio.\par \par \uc2 Does Chris ever go to a classical music concert? Part of the appeal is the contrast between the whisper-quiet passages and the fortissimo of almost a hundred musicians playing flat out. They do not need to be amplified. The loud music is thrilling, but not painful.\par \par \uc2 When Maume needs hearing aids several years before he should because of exposing his ears to excessive volume, I suppose he will expect me to pay for them out of my taxes.\par \par \uc2 Seriously, we are storing up huge costs for the \uc2 NHS\uc2  because of this insane liking for loud live music, and the use of portable music players on public transport with their monotonous percussion noises leaking from the earphones.\par \par \uc2 I like certain kinds of rock music but I refuse to go to excessively loud gigs. And to suggest that one wears earplugs is adding one stupid idea to another.\par \par \uc2 Peter Grove, Salisbury, Wiltshire\par \par \uc2 Days of the celibate priest are numbered\par \par \uc2 Your report \u8220\'20\'1CCatholic bishops call for priests to be able to marry\u8221\'20\'1D (18 April) on the possibility of change relating to the discipline of celibacy for Roman Catholic priests is timely.\par \par \uc2 The recently reported remarks of Pope Francis, suggesting that local diocesan bishops must take responsibility for the solution of local problems, has opened the door to discussion in a new way.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 For too long, the whole matter of celibacy for those ordained in the Roman Catholic communion has been a closed book. The Church, through the example of Francis, is experiencing a re-examination of its mission.\par \par \uc2 This one aspect of Church discipline (for that is all it is) is now being questioned. The answering of a call to ministry need not be associated with an altogether separate calling to the celibate life. The time has come to revoke a discipline that has become a hindrance to vocation.\par \par \uc2 Chris McDonnell , Secretary, Movement for Married Clergy UK, Little Haywood, Staffordshire\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s nothing funny about \u8216\'20\'18comedic\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 I do not agree with Guy Keleny\u8217\'20\'19s dismissal of the word \u8220\'20\'1Ccomedic\u8221\'20\'1D (Errors and Omissions, 12 April). If the word \u8220\'20\'1Ccomic\u8221\'20\'1D were used in the sentence he examined, it could be taken to mean that the sensibility is comic, in the sense of being funny, rather than relating to comedy.\par \par \uc2 Most people would probably not be confused for long by \u8220\'20\'1Cdistinctive visual and comic sensibility\u8221\'20\'1D. However, I think \u8220\'20\'1Ccomedic\u8221\'20\'1D works well and removes any ambiguity even if it is a neologism.

But I do believe there is a very strong case for expecting large employers to sign up to a tough code of conduct as to how they are applied.\par \par \uc2 "For instance, if an employee proves reliable enough to be working for a big company for a year or more then there should be an expectation that the company will offer him or her a permanent position."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said he did not blame multinational firms for trying to minimise their tax bills, but said they had to show responsibility to their workforce.\par \par \uc2 "I do not blame them for that - it is the responsibility of the authorities to set the tax regime after all," he said.\par \par \uc2 "But I do say that they should show more responsibility towards those on the shop floor. Often those kept on zero-hours contracts are women with major family responsibilities."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage was praised as "charismatic" by the leader of France's far-right National Front, who said her "arms will be open" to Ukip if it wants to join together to fight the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ukip told the BBC it is not interested in any deal with Marine Le Pen or her party, adding this is particularly because of "prejudice and anti-Semitism" in the National Front.\par \par \uc2 Ms Le Pen said she did not see UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage as part of her movement and said an invitation for the party to be part of her campaign was no longer open.\par \par \uc2 But when asked if she would be open to work with Mr Farage in the future, s he told BBC's Newsnight: " I am above personal considerations and any harm people try to inflict on us.\par \par \uc2 "My concern is the interests of the European people. My arms will be open as long as it's in the interest of the European people for us to join together in a common project to fight the \uc2 European Union\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Asked what she made of Mr Farage, she said: "I think he's undoubtedly a charismatic leader. He has a message that people really want to hear and which is based on a correct reading of the situation.\par \par \uc2 "We do have our differences - for example, on the economy - there's no doubt about that.\par \par \uc2 "But I do think there is something he's missing, and that's the seriousness of the situation our continent finds itself in.\par \par \uc2 "If he understood how serious the EU's situation is, he would support the collaboration of all patriotic movements, and he wouldn't resort to tactics and strategy."\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140418ea4i0002w\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Pregnant Birmingham woman agreed to enter sham marriage to bogus wedding racket organiser\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nick McCarthy   \par \uc2 383 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 April 2014\par 16:57\par \uc2 birminghammail.co.uk\par \uc2 EVEMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Trinity Mirror   \par \par \uc2 Romana Nistrova, a 23-year-old Czech national from Birmingham, agreed to enter into a sham marriage with Harpal Singh\par \par \uc2 The organiser of a bogus weddings racket was caught at his own fake marriage to a young would-be bride from Birmingham, a court has heard.\par \par \uc2 Harpal Singh, 51, made \u163\'00\'A35,000 a time setting up sham marriages between Czech women and Asian students.\par \par \uc2 But Indian-born Singh was arrested after registry office staff in Wales became suspicious his divorce papers were fake.\par \par \uc2 He was stopped from going through with his own fake marriage and found to be carrying a bag of identity cards and \u8220\'20\'1Cmarriage packs\u8221\'20\'1D for other bogus weddings.\par \par \uc2 Romana Nistrova, a 23-year-old Czech national from Birmingham, agreed to enter into a sham marriage with him, was given a 12-month suspended sentence and ordered to do community work.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Singh was jailed for four years and five months after he and three other defendants admitted conspiracy.\par \par \uc2 Judge Neil Bidder told Cardiff Crown Court he would be recommending Singh was deported.\par \par \uc2 Haider Ali and Awais Ahmed, both 23, from Surrey and London, who had paid to go through sham marriages, were jailed for 12 months but freed because of time spent on remand.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Davies, prosecuting, said: \u8220\'20\'1CSingh would arrange marriages for Pakistani, Indian and Nepalese men who were either about to have visas run out or had overstayed.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHe would arrange for them to marry Czech women who had EU residency and could confer this to any husband.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The court was told Singh, who lived in London, entered the UK in 2006 on a six-month visa with his wife and three children.\par \par \uc2 But after two failed \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  applications, he was caught trying to marry at Cardiff Register Office last May.\par \par \uc2 Judge Bidder told the defendants: \u8220\'20\'1CThese actions are an attack on the proper system of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  control and also the institution of marriage.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou, Singh, planned to make money by exploiting people\u8217\'20\'19s desires to remain in the country and preying on women\u8217\'20\'19s financial hardship.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAli and Ahmad intended to avoid \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  controls to remain in the UK.

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Front: Welby's first year: Faith, hope and tremendous energy: Uplifting in public and hard-nosed in private, the archbishop of Canterbury has made a big impact, writes \uc2 Andrew Brown\b0\par\par\uc2 Andrew Brown   \par \uc2 3,809 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 April 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Justin Welby\uc2  now looks like the best archbishop of Canterbury the Church of England could possibly have, but when he was appointed he was almost unknown, and had only been a diocesan bishop for nine months. What got him the job - after he had made the shortlist - was that he was the only candidate who did not deny or flinch from the internal research suggesting that the church would dwindle, on existing trends, from about one million committed members to 150,000 by 2050.\par \par \uc2 His first year in the job has been marked by tremendous energy and rather more physical and moral courage than is expected of an archbishop, but there is a tremendous sense of urgency underlying this display.\par \par \uc2 He has already had two notable successes, and one of them will last. He has led the church past the General Synod's traumatic failure to approve female bishops in 2012, so that it seems certain that some will be appointed next year; and in the summer he managed to get the whole country talking about loan sharks and thinking of the Church of England as an organisation more concerned with the evils of payday lending than of sex.\par \par \uc2 He denounced payday lenders as evil in the House of Lords. Within a day the Financial Times discovered that the church itself had an indirect investment in Wonga through a fund in which its pension fund invests. Welby was furious when he discovered this but in public, on the Today programme, simply and disarmingly admitted it was a mistake. The whole thing was an improvisation that did him a great deal of good. His bold statement that the church could instead invest in credit unions that would "compete Wonga out of existence" was never really tested. What got through was the unmistakable sincerity of his rage and pity for the victims of such lenders and his determination to do more than seems possible, even if it's much less than is needed.\par \par \uc2 He has not been able to heal the international schism over homosexuality, which has, if anything, grown worse in the last year. The archbishop of Nigeria, Nicholas Okoh, who was an enthusiastic backer of a law that makes it punishable with a jail sentence even to talk about gay marriage, said recently: "Women are not scarce, men are not scarce and God has made adequate arrangement for human sexuality, so anybody who is developing any extra sexual instinct or desire, I think such a person should attend to himself because there is something wrong."\par \par \uc2 Only a tiny minority of members of the Church of England would say things like that, although some would only regret Okoh's lack of ambiguity. Welby might have been one of them 15 years ago but he has changed since then, and he understands that the country has changed too. He will not be able to hold on to the Nigerians, or the Church of Uganda, another enthusiastic backer of homophobic laws. But he is making strenuous efforts to hold together as much as possible of the remains of the Anglican Communion, although there is no longer any pretence that this is a coherent body with discipline and doctrines of its own. One of Welby's closest advisers dismissed that idea as "a Roman Catholic fantasy".\par \par \uc2 That's only one of the sacred cows he has been slaughtering. In many respects, he has behaved like a business executive, with, in private, a remarkably hard-nosed realism no matter how uplifting he has been in public. "He's definitely an executive type," says one senior colleague. "He thinks in those terms. He operates in those terms. He's willing to make quite big moves."\par \par \uc2 The most obvious example of this dynamism was his recovery from the synod's fiasco over female bishops in 2012, when legislation that would have made it possible to choose women as bishops was blocked by a rump of conservative evangelical lay people, elected through an arcane system of committees that ensured they were wholly unrepresentative. Welby's reaction was threefold. First, he co-opted a number of senior women on to the committees previously reserved for bishops, so that they had access to real power. He pushed the synod into drastically shortening its timetable for legislation, so the mistaken vote could be undone in two years instead of five. And he set up a process of reconciliation and informal face-to-face negotiations between supporters and opponents.\par \par \uc2 None of this might have worked without the shock and revulsion felt in the wider church - and in parliament - at the failure of the earlier legislation. But this reaction would not on its own have shaken the defences of the conservatives, who were still resisting last summer. Only the personal and institutional pressure that Welby applied had that effect, and by February this year the opponents had accepted a much worse deal than they had earlier rejected, yet seemed happier about it. This was not entirely because accepting inevitable defeat meant they could continue to wrangle about gay clergy for the foreseeable future.\par \par \uc2 When first chosen, it seemed the most notable thing about Welby was that he had been a successful businessman: a man who could chastise bankers in their own language. But looking back after his first year, the most notable thing is less his civilian job than his formation in the peculiarly English upper-class Christianity of Eton, Cambridge and Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB). These are the places where Christianity is part of the culture in a way that isn't true elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 Welby's background was a startling mixture of privilege and insecurity. On his mother's side he was descended from five generations of colonial administrators. She had been a secretary to Winston Churchill; among her close relatives were Lord Portal, who ran the RAF, and RA Butler. His stepfather was a distinguished theologian. But his father, who soon divorced his mother, had only appeared to be an Englishman called Gavin Welby. In fact - unknown to his English family - he was born in a Jewish-German \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  family called Weiler, made his first fortune bootlegging in New York during prohibition, and died an alcoholic who had left two years of Welby's school fees at Eton unpaid.\par \par \uc2 Gavin Welby was a figure of enormous charm and energy, but entirely unreliable and mysterious even to those closest to him. At Eton Welby was not among the fashionable boys. He was much later described by his housemaster with wonderful condescension as "a model boy, though quite undistinguished". He was not a Christian then: he had had the conventional upper-class socialisation of tedious hymns and meaningless sermons, which normally functions as a vaccine against religious fervour. But at Cambridge he was converted by an extraordinary group of earnest upper-class evangelicals, who now, 30 years later, have taken over the Church of England.\par \par \uc2 The group that later became the core of the HTB movement was, from the outside, quite ludicrously posh. Five of them, for example, were called Nicky and four of those had been to Eton. They came out of a culture of clean-living, rugger-playing manliness that seemed little changed since the first world war. In fact, though, this had been a deliberate anachronism planted in the 1950s and operating through summer camps that recruited through the public-school network.\par \par \uc2 And just as their tradition was a little phoney, so was their place at the heart of the establishment. Three of the core group (Nicky Gumbel, who more or less invented the Alpha course, Ken Costa, who became a banker, and Welby himself) were partly Jewish, though Welby did not then know his father's real identity. They had the self-assurance to appear absurd, with their earnestness and the tracts they handed out, but not the self-assurance to suppose they deserved their privilege.\par \par \uc2 Enthusiastic Christianity was not in the mainstream at Eton. The ungenial contempt of more secular Etonians is captured by an entry in Alan Clark's diaries about Michael Alison, a Tory politician who was also a churchwarden at HTB: "Saintly but useless. You need someone with guile, patience, an easy, fluent manner of concealing the truth but drawing it from others in that job. It is extraordinary how from time to time one does get people who have been through Brigade school, taken their commission and served, seen all human depravity as only one can at Eton . . . and yet go all naive and Godwatch."\par \par \uc2 In fact, the form of Christianity to which Welby was converted did emphasise the worthlessness of unredeemed humanity. It wasn't really naive at all. "Guile, patience, and an easy, fluent manner" distinguish Etonian Christians as much as Etonian pagans. It's just that the Christians want to tell you the truth as well.\par \par \uc2 For a man with a well-deserved reputation for honesty and straight dealing, Welby has said some staggeringly untrue things - most famously when he told Giles Fraser that he was "one of the thicker bishops in the Church of England". He has an unforced relish in things of the mind - he loves the efflorescence of Nigerian English for its own sake - but he is not an intellectual. He doesn't build systems - he looks for what works.\par \par \uc2 But self-deprecation of that sort doesn't count as dishonesty when no one (at least no one in the club) is meant to take it seriously, and it is in any case flattering to all the other bishops.\par \par \uc2 The young Cambridge Christians, so outwardly conventional, were in one respect rebels against everything they had been taught. They embraced wholeheartedly the charismatic revival - talking in tongues, miraculous healing, fainting in the spirit, and even prophecies - all things anathema to the older Calvinist tradition that was then dominant among Cambridge evangelicals. Their teacher in this was a bear-like Californian, John Wimber, who had been the drummer for the Righteous Brothers, and founded the immensely successful Vineyard group of charismatic churches. Quite a number of people brought up in the emotional straitjackets of the English upper classes found blessed relief in the permission the holy spirit gave them to weep or laugh and gibber and faint in public. In the mid-1990s, when the movement's influence on HTB was at its height, I visited a Chelsea church run by Nicky Lee, one of the men who converted Welby at Cambridge, and when the holy spirit started knocking people down, I'd hear the distinct rattle of pearls when the young women fainted to the floor.\par \par \uc2 This life-giving absurdity electrified them and gave those earnest young prigs the means to change over the years, even after they had become successful. The holy spirit gave them permission to be weird, and to navigate the collapse of traditional Christianity, which left an earlier generation of evangelicals stranded in reactionary nostalgia.\par \par \uc2 Asked what he had learned since his conversion, Welby said: "The longer you go on, the more I realise the infinite and amazing and wonderful diversity of human beings and what they do. Grace is at the heart of Christian faith and not law. The church isn't principally about rules. It's about a relationship with Jesus Christ, and he shapes people's behaviour. The street pastors, helping people at 3am on a Saturday morning who are drunk out of their minds, are not going to give them a lecture about drink. They're just going to help them to get home. The church is not a place where good people go. It's a place where bad people go to meet God. It's a refuge for sinners."\par \par \uc2 When Welby left Cambridge he dithered for a bit and then found a job working for a French oil company, \uc2 Elf Aquitaine\uc2 . More importantly, he married Caroline Eaton, a classics student at Cambridge, whose sister was for a while the vicar's secretary at HTB: the networks remained incredibly tight. In their summer holidays the couple went Bible smuggling together behind the iron curtain. Caroline Welby still accompanies him on some foreign trips, most recently a harrowing journey through the war zones of South Sudan and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. On that trip, as he later told the synod, they walked through a Sudanese town where 3,000 people had recently been killed. The bodies of 22 people from the cathedral staff - murdered and, if women, raped as well - were waiting for the archbishop to bury them in a mass grave. Yet he keeps going back. He doesn't flinch.\par \par \uc2 This life is an enormous distance from the future he had when he was an oil man in Paris - though that is where his visits to Nigeria started. The newly married couple lived in France for five years. Their first child, Johanna, was born there. When she was seven months old he was promoted to a job in London, but on the journey in the car with Caroline they crashed. Johanna was thrown clear in her carrycot and died in hospital three days later. The Welbys went on to have five more children but the experience of bereavement stayed with them. Welby's unofficial and very evangelical biographer claims that Caroline Welby's immediate reaction after the crash was that "maybe somehow she was at fault for not praying hard enough before the journey".\par \par \uc2 This shows the way in which God appeared to the young people of HTB as a permanent presence and companion, with opinions on everything - an omnipotence somewhere between a father and a nanny. Later, visiting a Vineyard church in California, they came to a more balanced view. It is a very notable feature of Welby's Christianity that much of it has been formed outside the Church of England, both in the charismatic evangelical Vineyard network, and later through contacts with Roman Catholics: he has invited a Catholic community to live and pray full-time in Lambeth Palace.\par \par \uc2 After a year in London working for \uc2 Elf Aquitaine\uc2 , Welby was headhunted by Enterprise Oil, a company formed to exploit the privatisation of British Gas's North Sea assets. In the five years he worked there as treasurer, it grew to be one of the 30 largest companies on the stock exchange. By that stage, his salary was more than pounds 100,000 a year. He threw it all in to become a vicar, and not even a fashionable one.\par \par \uc2 He trained in Durham, rather than one of the Oxbridge seminaries, and his first parish was a working-class suburb of Coventry. He remained based in the city for 10 years. His energy, intelligence and experience marked him out for promotion even in an organisation as sclerotic and short-sighted as the Church of England can be. Coventry cathedral has specialised in teaching and practising reconciliation, and Welby was drawn into this work early on. He travelled almost everywhere where Christians were killing or being killed - he has made 70 visits to the dangerous regions of Nigeria, and in 2003 made an overland dash to Baghdad from Jordan in company with Andrew White, another HTB figure who became the Anglican vicar of Baghdad. Several times he texted Caroline because he thought he might imminently be killed.\par \par \uc2 From Coventry he moved to become the dean of Liverpool cathedral, a building emblematic of the Church of England's troubles: it stands gigantic, architecturally remarkable, largely empty and almost broke in an indifferent and rather hostile city. He sorted the finances within the first three years. Cathedral attendance went up, as attendance in almost all cathedrals has done in the past 10 years. He had the bells play John Lennon's anti-theist song Imagine as part of an arts festival, which shocked some people but helped to restore the sense that the cathedral was connected to the city's imagination.\par \par \uc2 When he was promoted to be bishop of Durham, one of the church's most senior posts, few were surprised. But his approach was astonishingly effective and free of pretension. At the time he said: "The longer I go on with this, the more I realise that the Church of England is not an organisation in any recognisable sense. Because bishops are dressed up in funny clothes, with funny hats and special sticks, it's assumed that if they say to a bunch of parish clergy: 'Do something,' they will do it. But that's not how it works and never has been."\par \par \uc2 Within months he had circulated a document in the diocese saying that without realism about finances the whole thing would collapse within 15 years. He urged, and put through, a reform of the funding system in which parishes were allowed to decide what they could afford to pay the central authorities, instead of being assessed. On the other hand, they would be expected to pay what they had promised. Currently, 40% of them do not.\par \par \uc2 This kind of realism has carried through to his time in Canterbury. He works there in small groups of no more than six or seven, which debate decisions thoroughly before they are taken. He quickly culled the old guard at Lambeth and appointed an eclectic team, including, Jo Bailey Wells as his chaplain, who had been working with her husband in the US for eight years when chosen. He is by nature impetuous says one well-placed observer, and this way of working is a deliberate check on his temperament. But once decisions are taken, they are driven through effectively. One of these groups is planning a huge cull of ecclesiastical regulations. The aim is to make it easier to plant new churches, reopen old ones, and close down those that can no longer be sustained. "That sort of thing needs to change very dramatically," he says.\par \par \uc2 He really does believe in the possibility of church growth, even though he is realistic about the fact of decline and the danger, on present trends, of complete collapse. Asked about the thesis that religion is now a toxic brand, especially to the young, he says: "A lot depends on how you ask the question. We've got a lot of churches with loads of young people, but I half accept the premise . . . there is an element of toxicity in the brand with some people. What's absolutely essential is to demonstrate and talk about the love and goodness of Christ and how he reaches out to people, rather than telling people how to behave."\par \par \uc2 The trouble is that most of his church still supposes that telling people how to behave is the best part of Christianity and telling other Christians how to behave is quite the most enjoyable part. The schism over homosexuality looks impossible to heal. HTB used to be implacably opposed, as it once was opposed to divorce, but now has moved to a position of pained silence. Welby himself was profoundly shocked by the reaction to his opposition to gay marriage in the House of Lords. Now he says that the fight is over: "The church has reacted by fully accepting that it's the law, and should react on Saturday by continuing to demonstrate, in word and action, the love of Christ for every human being."\par \par \uc2 But in Africa the movement has been sharply the other way. People around the archbishop are horrified by reports that two suspected gay men have been burned alive by mobs in Uganda who were celebrating the passage of an anti-gay law supported by the Ugandan Anglican church. But there is no pressure that he can apply that does not risk being dismissed as neocolonial interference.\par \par \uc2 The African opponents of gay people have coalesced into an alternative version of the Anglican Communion, called Gafcon. This has close connections with parts of the HTB movement that are planning to split from the Church of England formally if it moves towards open recognition of gay relationships. Welby himself spoke to the Gafcon primates before their most recent meeting, but did not attend it. He assured them of his admiration for their courage and that he had listened carefully to their view on sexuality.\par \par \uc2 In its studied absence of guile, this was reminiscent of De Gaulle telling the Algerian settlers that he had heard them - which they, to their cost, misunderstood as saying he had joined their side. Welby has not joined either side in the debate quite yet. Some clergy will undoubtedly marry their same-sex partners, despite the orders from bishops - among them Welby - that they refrain from doing so. But the discipline in those cases will be a matter for the individual bishops. The archbishop has positioned himself a little above the fray. This is characteristically diplomatic and realistic, as no one knows whether there are in fact legal ways to punish vicars who marry legally.\par \par \uc2 The job of archbishop of Canterbury is of course impossible. Welby sleeps six hours a night (if that), he travels relentlessly, and his diary is crammed: for this article he could talk for 10 minutes on the telephone, booked 10 days in advance. No one I spoke to who had worked with him did not trust him, but no one felt they knew him, either. He is in the establishment now, but not on its side. His commitment to the poor made a huge impression in Durham. But perhaps he is not so very far from his roots after all.\par \par \uc2 This mild man is oddly reminiscent of General Conyers, a character created by the rather more conventional Etonian Anthony Powell: "He was a man who gave the impression, rightly or wrongly, that he would stop at nothing. If he decided to kill you, he would kill you; if he thought it sufficient to knock you down, he would knock you down: if a mere reprimand was all required, he would confine himself to a reprimand. In addition to this, he patently maintained a good-humoured, well-mannered awareness of the inherent failings of human nature: the ultimate futility of all human effort."\par \par \uc2 Except, of course, that archbishops do not nowadays kill anyone, and Welby is sure that human effort is not in fact futile, because God notices and pities it.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Promotion\par \par \uc2 Left, \uc2 Justin Welby\uc2  speaks to members of his congregation outside Canterbury Cathedral last Easter Sunday, shortly after his enthronement\par \par \uc2 Procession\par \par \uc2 Below, Welby gets a helping hand against the weather during a journey with prayers from the City of London to Southwark\par \par \uc2 Communication\par \par \uc2 The archbishop at LBC in London (bottom) for a live radio phone-in this month\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140418ea4i00018\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 'We'll tackle scandalous zero hour contracts', says Farage in pitch for working class vote\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nigel Farage MEP   \par \uc2 857 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 April 2014\par 12:00\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 I HAVE spoken a lot recently about the cabal of big business and big politics that has become too dominant in the way our country is run.\par \par \uc2 You will find no keener champion of free enterprise and competition than me. But where a few big players dominate things, competition can fail and people can end up getting exploited.\par \par \uc2 So today I want to blow the whistle on an issue that concerns multinational companies exploiting employees. I am talking about the recent trend towards zero-hours contracts for working class jobs.\par \par \uc2 With so much cheap labour flooding in from abroad, giant corporations are in an increasingly powerful position to dictate terms and conditions for workers.\par \par \uc2 Now zero hours contracts \u8211\'20\'13 where no fixed hours are stipulated in advance but employers and employees come to agreement about hours of work available each week or day as they go along \u8211\'20\'13 suit some people.\par \par \uc2 Students looking to work a couple of evenings a week, for example. Or parents who are mainly at home but have the odd morning available. It can suit such people to be on call and to be asked the night before whether they can make the next day or the day after that.\par \par \uc2 But while having a zero hours contract as an option is one thing, having it as the only available form of work is quite another.\par \par \uc2 And keeping people on zero hours contracts for year after year when they aspire to stable employment so that they can provide for their families is something else again.\par \par \uc2 I do not believe in banning zero hours contracts. But I do believe there is a very strong case for expecting large employers to sign up to a tough code of conduct as to how they are applied.\par \par \uc2 For instance, if an employee proves reliable enough to be working for a big company for a year or more then there should be an expectation that the company will offer him or her a permanent position.\par \par \uc2 At its worst this rapidly proliferating practice reminds me of the way dockers used to have to gather at the dock gates in the 1920s and a foreman would come out and point to those he could use and tell the rest to go home with no money in their pockets. To expect people to pay their bills and raise a family under employment conditions like this is just not on.\par \par \uc2 For small companies I can understand why flexibility can sometimes be the difference between life and death.\par \par \uc2 I am quite unusual for a politician in that I have actual run a business and employed people. But the truth is that most small companies rise or fall on their team-spirit and so the idea of keeping people dangling on zero hours for years at a time is not one that would appeal to many.\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage believes David Cameron has forgotten about zero hour contracts [PA]\par \par \uc2 So we are left with the big battalions. Multinationals that are often foreign-owned and very careful not to pay any more tax than they are legally obliged to. I do not blame them for that \u8211\'20\'13 it is the responsibility of the authorities to set the tax regime after all.\par \par \uc2 But I do say that they should show more responsibility towards those on the shop floor. Often those kept on zero-hours contracts are women with major family responsibilities.\par \par \uc2 Official ONS figures show rocketing numbers of people employed under zero hours contracts. In 2012 it was estimated that they covered 250,000 workers but last year that estimate more than doubled to 582,000.\par \par \uc2 I have even heard of cases where household name international companies have resorted to expecting workers on zero hours contracts to turn up in the morning and then go home without pay if they are deemed surplus to requirements.\par \par \uc2 That offends my British sense of fair play.\par \par \uc2 The biggest and most profitable companies can and should do better than that.\par \par \uc2 It surprises me that none of the other political parties appears to want to talk about these excesses.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps it is because these multinationals are the ones willing to back their aim of keeping us in the EU by spouting alarmist drivel about what would happen if we left.\par \par \uc2 I have no truck with militant trade unionism \u8211\'20\'13 never have and never will.\par \par \uc2 Where over-mighty unions provoke frequent strikes and disrupt production then everyone loses. We must never go back to the bad old days of the 1970s.\par \par \uc2 But equally where over-mighty corporations refuse to accept any social obligation towards loyal employees I am moved to cry foul as well.\par \par \uc2 Unlimited \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from Eastern Europe and elsewhere has left many British working people pretty much defenceless against constant downgrades in their pay and employment conditions.\par \par \uc2 My message to them is that while the other parties may have forgotten about you, Ukip is aware of your plight and will speak up for you \u8211\'20\'13 however unpopular it makes us with the political class and its corporate allies.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140418ea4i001md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw59\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal885\pichgoal600

Afterwards I might think about it.\par \par \uc2 "I've been asked before." Enjoying two jars of real ale at the Walrus And Carpenter, one of his old haunts in the City of London, he said he regularly knocked back a few drinks at lunchtime.\par \par \uc2 But he said he had never taken anything stronger than traditional bitter.\par \par \uc2 He said: "Do you know I've drunk so much of it over the years that I've had no time for anything else. I have made a lot of mistakes in my life, but the one mistake I haven't made is drugs."\par \par \uc2 Nigel worked as a high-earning trader in the City for 20 years and seems to have acquired legendary status.\par \par \uc2 Pub staff asked for pictures, while drinkers asked to shake his hand as he was mobbed like a rock star.\par \par \uc2 Close up I could see why people fell under his spell as he oozed old-fashioned charm, confidence and charisma.\par \par \uc2 Nigel's public approval exploded after his EU television debate with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, 47, last month.\par \par \uc2 Opinion polls showed the Ukip leader to be the clear winner with 69% of viewers saying he had performed the best.\par \par \uc2 And he said he did not feel the slightest bit sorry for humiliating LibDem leader Clegg, or "Cleggers" as he calls him.\par \par \uc2 He said the public were behind him on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and added: "The thing that killed Cleggers in that debate was when I made the point that we have opened the door to 485million people.\par \par \uc2 "Many come from very poor countries like Romania and there is no limit on who can come in.\par \par \uc2 "Once we've got back control we can decide who comes but we should only take people who have something to offer. We shouldn't take people with life-threatening diseases, we should put our own people first."\par \par \uc2 Nigel, 50, is expected to stand as an MP at the next election, but is concentrating on winning Euro elections which take place in May.\par \par \uc2 He said: "What matters to me is not what rank I hold but that we change things."\par \par \uc2 Branding the current crop of Westminster politicians "college boys", he blasted the Coalition for having "no idea".\par \par \uc2 He said while supping his ale: "They have no experience of real life. Never had a job in the proper world.\par \par \uc2 "They have absolutely no understanding of what it's like out there for ordinary families."\par \par \uc2 This week Nigel has dodged allegations about misusing taxpayer cash from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and yesterday he dismissed the expenses row as a smear campaign to try to derail the Ukip express.\par \par \uc2 He added: "The establishment are scared. We have a British establishment that said 40 years ago that Europe was our future and they are still wedded to that position.\par \par \uc2 "They know that I'm leading the rebel political party and they're terrified of us.\par \par \uc2 "They are terrified of our arguments and they are really scared." Nigel also revealed he is a regular reader of the Daily Star, which always puts him in a good mood.\par \par \uc2 He added: "What the Star gives people is the news but it puts a smile on their face as well, which I hope to a little extent is what I've tried to do in politics."\par \par \uc2 tammy.hughes@dailystar.co.uk\par \par \uc2 Document DAISTA0020140418ea4i0003u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

Throughout my teens and growing up in Bolton, I've seen less and less of the Union flag.\par \par \uc2 "It's been hijacked by the far-Right and it's time we take that symbol back into mainstream British life."\par \par \uc2 Bolton council\uc2  will now write to all schools in the area and ask them to consider flying the flag and incorporating singing God Save The Queen into the school day.\par \par \uc2 Mr Dean added: "We hear complaints from people who come to this country and don't settle, and some of it is our own fault.\par \par \uc2 "If we were more patriotic \u8212\'20\'14 if we sang our National Anthem and flew our flag \u8212\'20\'14 and instilled it in our younger generations, they would do.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's a win-win situation. It's not rubbing anyone up the wrong way. It's a symbol of all the things we are proud of as British citizens."\par \par \uc2 Left-wing activists at the Labour-run authority tried to torpedo the idea by dismissing the proposal as "American" and "un-British".\par \par \uc2 Labour councillor Chris Peacock said: "Who will pay for these new flag poles and flags? Schools' budgets are already stretched.\par \par \uc2 "In the already-packed school day, is there time for the National Anthem to be sung?" But last night Tory MP Philip Davies said: "I fully commend this idea. I think it will be great for community cohesion.\par \par \uc2 "People can belong to any religion or background but we should all be able to unite behind the Union flag and the National Anthem.\par \par \uc2 "I hope schools will take it on board and I am sure it will prove a massive boost for community relations in Bolton."\par \par \uc2 Married father-of-four Mr Dean said the idea was inspired by the memory of his grandfather Ahmed, the first Indian \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  to settle in Bolton in 1923.\par \par \uc2 Mr Dean told the Daily Express: "My grandfather was a proud Boltonian, proud of the Union Jack. He came here in his late teens and stayed because he fell in love with Britain."\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140418ea4i0005t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

The reason our prisons are full to overcrowding is because judges can no longer pass deterrent sentences.\par \par \uc2 "Until politicians wake up to this fact, criminals will continue to re\u8211\'20\'13offend and the prison population will continue to rise."\par \par \uc2 In February he attacked our "leaking sieve" borders during the case of Albanian illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  drug dealer Baksim Bushati, 37, who was deported three times only to return to offend again.\par \par \uc2 He said the UK's border agencies were powerless, adding: "Our defences to illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are leaking like a sieve."\par \par \uc2 In 2010 the judge slammed "pitifully inadequate" \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  controls when he sentenced a Vietnamese human trafficker, Hanh Van Vu, who had "married" his sister to stay in Britain.\par \par \uc2 As he jailed him for 11 years, he told Vu that he and his sister faced deportation, adding: "I will do my duty. I can only hope the Home Office will do theirs."\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140418ea4i0005h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A judge has accused police forces of "massaging" crime figures by preventing cases from going to court to save officers' time.\par \par \uc2 Judge \uc2 Richard Bray\uc2 , who stepped down last week from Northampton crown court after 30 years on the bench, used his official farewell event yesterday to launch a scathing attack on the criminal justice system.\par \par \uc2 "The figures have been massaged. Robbery is now classified as theft from a person; burglary is downgraded to criminal damage. Cautions and reprimands are used to save police time. But you ask the people who walk about the towns and cities at night if crime has gone down and they will give you a very different picture."\par \par \uc2 Judge Bray claimed that the government had forced him to pass sentences that were too lenient, and that initiatives such as suspended sentences had failed. "Sentencing is a skill only acquired after long experience and cannot be reduced to a tick in a box. We've had suspended sentences introduced, abolished then introduced again. All this tinkering about is more to do with money and votes rather than criminal justice, while the prison population has continued to rise. None of the government initiatives has worked. We've now got warnings, reprimands, cautions, conditional discharges that prevent people from appearing in court."\par \par \uc2 He said that the increasing constraints on judges meant they were becoming more like civil servants. "My guiding philosophy was always to do justice without fear or favour, without bias towards the prosecution or the defence," he said. "It is not up to the executive to tell the jurisdiction what to do, it is up to the executive to make sure they have enough spaces in prison.\par \par \uc2 "Judges should be able to make decisions without fear of influence from government. That seems potentially at risk. We are almost being treated as if we are civil servants and distributing power and influence on behalf of the government. We are described as stakeholders in the criminal justice system. Those who want to become judges have to sit exams and attend interviews where they have to spout political correctness like civil servants."\par \par \uc2 It is not the first time that Judge Bray has been critical of government bodies. In February this year his anger was directed at the Border Agency and Home Office when he described the UK border as a "leaking sieve".\par \par \uc2 His comments came after an illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  drug dealer was deported three times only to return each time to commit more crimes.\par \par \uc2 In 2010 he sentenced a car thief to jail using rhyming verse: "I have this to say to you; Right now you feel down; You have got months to do; Despite what you have done, Let us hope the locked door; Will make you more sure not to come back for more."

As was usual in the case of study visas he had originally been allowed to work, however his most recent visa had been granted without such permission. Home Office officials claimed that he had been working in breach of those most recent arrangements and directed his removal from the UK under section 10 of the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  and Asylum Act 1999. Where section 10 was invoked against a person they retained only an out of country right of appeal.\par \par \uc2 Mr Michael Biggs for the claimant; Mr Matthew Barnes for the defendant.\par \par \uc2 HER LADYSHIP said that one limb of the claimant's argument was that fairness demanded that he be given reasons for the exercise of discretion to take enforcement action under section 10 of the 1999 Act.\par \par \uc2 The secretary of state conceded that the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  officer had to have reasonable evidence upon which she could form a rational judgment that the claimant was working in breach of his visa conditions, at the time of taking enforcement action, but submitted that fairness only required that evidence to be communicated to the affected person when he appealed.\par \par \uc2 That submission was not accepted, for two reasons. First, the court had to be in a position to see that the decisionmaker appreciated at the point of making a section 10 decision that she had a discretion, and that she had exercised it fairly and in accordance with the secretary of state's published policy, or that she had recognized that she was departing from it and had said why that was so.\par \par \uc2 That did not require very detailed reasons, but it did require enough to enable the court to see that the decisionmaker had correctly addressed the issue of discretion and, at least on her own stated case, had rational grounds for doing so. Otherwise, the court could not see that the decision-maker had acted fairly in determining that the other potential issues of fact and law ought to be determined on an out-of-country, rather than an in-country appeal\par \par \uc2 There was a second reason why fairness demanded that at least outline reasons be given at the point of making a section 10 decision: being able to proceed with an appeal only out of country created certain practical difficulties for an appellant. Seeking and paying for access to a video link was one potential issue. Securing evidence in the UK was another.\par \par \uc2 Fairness demanded that at least the gist of the evidence upon which a removal decision under section 10 of the 1999 Act was taken would be communicated to the subject of that decision at the time when the decision itself was communicated, both in order to ensure that the court could see that there had been a lawful and rational exercise of discretion and also to ensure that the appeal process was as fair as possible.\par \par \uc2 Solicitors: Sam Solicitors, Sutton; Treasury Solicitor.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140418ea4i0008m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Britain is being invaded. Close the borders!\b0\par\par\uc2 Ben Macintyre   \par \uc2 951 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 April 2014\par \uc2 The Times\par \uc2 T\par \uc2 1; Eire\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Not since the Vikings have so many foreign species colonised our lands. But - truth be told - many should be welcomed\par \par \uc2 The Japanese knotweed is already on the march along the banks of the loch near my Scottish home, its bright green alien fronds shooting upwards at the rate of a metre a month and proliferating like some strange horticultural plague. The knotweed was imported to Britain by Victorian gardeners as a decorative pond plant. Now it is rampant.\par \par \uc2 And where the knotweed ends, the common rhododendron starts, smothering the hillside, killing everything beneath it. When it flowers the rhododendron will spread a hideous Barbara Cartland pink across a landscape that should be painted in subtle browns and greens. Imported from Asia as ground cover for game, it is one of the nastiest weeds in Britain.\par \par \uc2 The sight of the knotweed and rhododendron, two alien foreign invaders fighting for space in a place where they should not be, depressed me, so I went for walk in the oak wood and then home for a comforting bowl of leek and potato soup \u8212\'20\'14 a walk among one non-native species and lunch on two more.\par \par \uc2 For most British oaks are not really British, but mainly Spanish; oaks were wiped out in the last glaciation, and reintroduced from the Iberian peninsula. Leeks arrived in this country with the Romans. (What did the Romans ever do for us? Vegetable soup: cabbage, onions, garlic and celery, along with chickens to make the stock.) The first potato was domesticated in Peru 10,000 years ago and only arrived in Europe towards the end of the 16th century.\par \par \uc2 We are hopelessly confused in Britain about what is and what is not native to this country. The outcry against alien invasive species frequently takes on a weird xenophobic tinge.\par \par \uc2 We fulminate against the imported grey squirrel (so much less cuddly than our home-grown Squirrel Nutkins), but largely ignore attractively striped zebra mussels from Russia, which appeared about a decade ago and are now causing billions of pounds worth of damage to water plants. The sturdy privet hedge is a symbol of suburban Britain, but comes from Japan.\par \par \uc2 There is a tendency to assume that non-British species are, by definition, dangerous, when some of the most invasive and ecologically-disruptive plants are native, such as bracken. The vast majority of incomers have arrived, settled down peacefully and become happily absorbed into British biological life.\par \par \uc2 The parallels with the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate are striking. Our ecological heritage, like our human population, is a fabulous hodgepodge, a fascinating intermingling over the centuries brought about by nature, accident and trade. As in the furore over human \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , there is a tendency to focus on where new arrivals come from or what they look like, rather than what they will do, for better or worse, when they get here.\par \par \uc2 The giant African snail provokes media hysteria, though as an invader it is both slow and controllable. Meanwhile, the stealthy intrusion from Europe of infected ash trees that could devastate the native ash passed unnoticed until too late.\par \par \uc2 The latest survey found 1,875 nonnative species of flora and fauna in Britain, most of which have been happily assimilated. Of these, 282 are classed as "invasive", but of those only a few can be considered truly dangerous, brutal, implacable colonisers \u8212\'20\'14 the Viking plunderers of the natural world.\par \par \uc2 These are the enemy interlopers that should be repelled with the full force of law and science. The need to eliminate certain hostile plants and animals was recognised this week by the Commons environmental audit committee. It called for an overhaul of laws on invasive species and injected a note of solid good sense into an issue often muddied by hysteria, anthropomorphism and a sort of biological racism. "We have to be smart and pick the fights that we know we can win," said Joan Walley, who chairs the committee.\par \par \uc2 The laws on species invasion are hopelessly antiquated. Last month the Grey Squirrels (Prohibition of Importation and Keeping) Order of 1937 was quietly dropped from the statute book: this had imposed a \u163\'00\'A35 fine for anyone who failed to report the presence of the animals on their land. Few people had ever done so and none had been fined.\par \par \uc2 The committee urged new legislation to ensure that landowners who fail to tackle notorious invaders are forced to pay for eradication measures carried out by government officials without their permission.\par \par \uc2 Any ship found to be in British ports with ballast tanks containing invasive organisms (which is how the zebra mussel hitched a lift here), should face heavy fines. England and Wales should follow Scotland in giving officials greater powers to impose "species control orders", enabling the eradication of invaders before they become established.\par \par \uc2 Destroying knotweed is not hard, but it is expensive. Some \u163\'00\'A31.5 billion was spent last year on battling this aggressive and unproductive colonist. That expense and effort would never have been necessary with proper controls in place.\par \par \uc2 There is no pure ecological Eden to which Britain can somehow return; biologically this has never been an island unto itself. There are friendly biological \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , and parasitic ones; there are species that come to settle and contribute to a rich heritage and others determined to take over and take advantage of our accommodating climate. As with humans, it is perfectly possible to spot the difference: to welcome one, and put a stop to the other.\par \par \uc2 The Roman leek can stay; the Japanese knotweed must go.\par \par \uc2 Our oaks are not really English and the leek was originally Roman\par \par \uc2 Infected ash trees rather than African snails are the danger\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140418ea4i00009\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Editorial; Opinion, Columns\par \b \uc2 Has the West fallen prey to crony capitalism?\b0\par\par\uc2 JEREMY WARNER   \par \uc2 964 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 April 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph\par \uc2 DT\par \uc2 1; National\par 27\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 There are certainly signs of a wealth gap \u8211\'20\'13 but that will inspire the strivers and innovators\par \par \uc2 A round my area in north\u8211\'20\'13west London, the housing market is again red\u8211\'20\'13hot. The only stuff that doesn't sell is the obviously undesirable or grossly overvalued. But here's the more interesting thing about the latest boom: the vast majority of these sales, to judge by the "to let" signs that instantly go up as the "for sale" billboards are taken down, is for investment purposes \u8211\'20\'13 "buy\u8211\'20\'13tolet" landlords, in other words.\par \par \uc2 If evidence were needed of the emergence of a new "rentier" class, London is surely it. Every man and his dog seem to be getting in on the act. By simply remortgaging an existing property and using the proceeds to buy the vacated flat down the road, you get yourself an apparently guaranteed source of income and capital growth. What could possibly go wrong? "L'Angleterre est une nation de boutiquiers", according to Napoleon; today we are perhaps better described as a nation of landlords. The cause is a familiar one \u8211\'20\'13 constrained supply in a relatively fast\u8211\'20\'13growing economy, made worse by London's evident attractions to overseas nationals. To operate an open\u8211\'20\'13door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy without first addressing the restricted size of London's housing stock was an act of almost criminal negligence.\par \par \uc2 The problem could easily be solved by meaningful reform to Britain's archaic town and country planning laws, but, sadly, policy\u8211\'20\'13makers suggest only politically easier, demand\u8211\'20\'13side solutions \u8211\'20\'13 rent controls, higher property taxes, or restricting credit and migration \u8211\'20\'13 none of which would address the underlying problem.\par \par \uc2 In any case, growing rentier activity in the housing sector has become symbolic of a much wider complaint about the nature of modern capitalism, with wealth and income seeming to be ever more concentrated in the hands of a relatively small, privileged minority.\par \par \uc2 Without help from the "Bank of Mum and Dad", it's much harder to climb aboard the property ladder \u8211\'20\'13 traditionally the main source of wealth accumulation for most people \u8211\'20\'13 than it was, even allowing for present, ludicrously low mortgage costs.\par \par \uc2 What with a recovering economy, an increasingly vibrant jobs market and the resumption at last of real income growth, Labour's electoral message on both austerity and living standards has lost much of its resonance. But there is still plenty of capital, as it were, to be made from the "inequality" ticket. "Progressives" on both sides of the Atlantic point to a growing body of academic research to support the idea that the economy has become the captive of big business, finance and other forms of economic rent, with the rest left behind.\par \par \uc2 A new study by researchers at Princeton and Northwestern universities, which claims to demonstrate that public policy in the US is unduly influenced by the rich and powerful, rather than representing the wishes of the majority \u8211\'20\'13 a statement of the blindingly obvious if ever there was one \u8211\'20\'13 is just the latest example of this kind of world view, building as it does on the generally rave reviews for a new book by the French economist, Thomas Piketty, showing that capital accumulation has been growing at a much faster rate than wages and the economy as a whole.\par \par \uc2 It is not so surprising, given the damage inflicted by the financial crisis, that such apparent unfairness is once more gaining political traction. Nor do I doubt that there is something to it. Yet the assumptions on which it is based \u8211\'20\'13 that wealth and income inequality is innately wrong and must be countered by government intervention \u8211\'20\'13 are old and misguided.\par \par \uc2 At the dawn of capitalism back in the 18th century, it was easy to imagine, as Karl Marx later argued, that all the benefits of productivity and innovative gain would flow to the capitalists. But it didn't work out that way. Even the poor of today enjoy lifestyles that their relatively well\u8211\'20\'13off forebears could scarcely have dreamed of.\par \par \uc2 Despite the setback of the financial crisis, there is no more reason for believing that the free market's capacity for raising living standards is any more broken today than it ever was.\par \par \uc2 What is more, in order to work effectively, it needs the incentives that income and wealth inequality provide. We know that taking a few pounds or dollars off the rich isn't going to diminish incentives very much, but too great a focus on redistribution from the top to the bottom most assuredly will. To brand the wealthy as the "undeserving rich", as much of the debate around rentier activity tends to, damages these incentives and thereby undermines aspiration, entrepreneurialism and innovation.\par \par \uc2 If we had a rentier class that used political influence to extract resources from others, then certainly you would want to re\u8211\'20\'13examine that world and deregulate, or change economic institutions, accordingly. No doubt there are pockets of such behaviour. Yet to think of the whole system as institutionalised crony capitalism is a gross exaggeration.\par \par \uc2 The same is true of finance, where the need to contain baser instincts has to be balanced against its ability to allocate capital effectively, a vital function in modern economies, which distinguishes them from the oligopoly that exists in much of the developing world. In any case, what might be said about the supply\u8211\'20\'13side constraints of the London housing market also applies to the free\u8211\'20\'13market system as a whole. If capital is taking an ever greater share of output, it is because of restrictions in supply, leading to excessive returns. The solution is not redistribution by government diktat, but a supply\u8211\'20\'13side revolution.\par \par \uc2 Comment on Jeremy Warner's view at telegraph.co.uk/personalview\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140418ea4i0004v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A View From The Bridge (Young Vic Theatre) Verdict: So real it's religious ?????\par \par \uc2 BY PATRICK MARMION\par \par \uc2 THIS solemn production of Arthur Miller's New York docker drama from 1956 is as close as you'll get to a religious experience this Easter without stepping inside a church.\par \par \uc2 Starring Mark Strong and Nicola Walker as Eddie Carbone and his loyal wife, Beatrice, it boasts two super-intense actors.\par \par \uc2 But fashionable Belgian director Ivo van Hove tops that with a Presbyterian rendition of the play, oddly inspired by Japanese Noh theatre, with bells tolling at key moments.\par \par \uc2 Jan Versweyveld's set is a mausoleum, from which side walls rise at the start to Faure's Requiem. Inside, Eddie, stripped to the waist, showers after a hard day's toil. Miller's play treats work as a virtual blessed sacrament, sought by desperate Italian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . So it's fitting, perhaps, that no one sets foot on stage without first removing their shoes.\par \par \uc2 But the total ban on furniture is a slightly perverse choice, given that Miller's story is anchored in the trappings of working-class Italian-Americans. Instead, this Spartan set sneakily enshrines modern minimalist values.\par \par \uc2 The justification is that it's a Greek tragedy, with Eddie sheltering the Sicilian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who come to threaten his increasingly dodgy bond with his pretty, orphaned niece. Vows and counter vows duly reach a bloody, ritualised climax.\par \par \uc2 One effect of van Hove's austere production is to demand even more of the acting, and this in turn pushes it towards melodrama.\par \par \uc2 As Eddie, Strong \u8212\'20\'14 tall and angular \u8212\'20\'14 prowls the stage like a lean wolf. When pushed to the edge of endurance, his eyes are, as Miller describes, 'like tunnels'.\par \par \uc2 Nicola Walker, as Beatrice, supplies devout intensity; while Phoebe Fox, as her niece Catherine, is a volatile mix of naivety and sexual awakening.\par \par \uc2 Emun Elliott and Luke Norris bode trouble as the handsome Sicilians who step off the boat complete with ready-formed Brooklyn drawls.\par \par \uc2 And if Michael Gould's accent wobbles a bit as the lawyer-narrator, the show owes less to realism than to sacramental submission. It is all rather pious, but saying so in this thespian enclave would be heresy, and could risk an inquisition!\par \par \uc2 PATRICK MARMION\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140417ea4i0001y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 SCHOOLS are being urged to fly the Union Jack and sing the national anthem at every assembly as part of a campaign to foster patriotism among the young.\par \par \uc2 The campaign in Bolton was launched by a Tory councillor whose grandfather was the town's first Indian \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It was approved this week despite a Labour councillor questioning whether schools with tight budgets could afford flags and poles.\par \par \uc2 Schools in the area will also be asked to fly the St George's cross on April 23, St George's Day, and the Commonwealth flag in March.\par \par \uc2 Mudasir Dean said he wanted to seize the Union Flag back from the Far Right and show children it was a symbol people from all backgrounds could celebrate.\par \par \uc2 'My grandfather came to Bolton in the 1920s from India,' he said. 'He lived here all his life and he was the first Asian to settle in Bolton.\par \par \uc2 'Growing up in Bolton, I've seen less and less of the Union Flag. It's been hijacked by the Far Right and it's time we take that symbol back into mainstream British, Bolton life.'\par \par \uc2 Councillor Dean said complaints that new \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  couldn't settle in Britain was sometimes 'our own fault'. 'If we were more patriotic - if we sang our national anthem and flew our flag - and instilled it in our younger generations, they would do,' he added.\par \par \uc2 Speaking before Wednesday's vote, Labour councillor and school governor Chris Peacock questioned the plan on practical grounds.\par \par \uc2 'Who will pay for these new flag poles and flags?' he asked. 'Schools' budgets are already stretched. Raising the Union flag won't raise standards - that should be our priority.'\par \par \uc2 However the Labour-controlled authority backed the motion, carried with 34 members in favour, four against and 11 abstentions.\par \par \uc2 The council will now write to all schools in the area and ask them to consider flying the flag and incorporating a performance of God Save the Queen into the school day.\par \par \uc2 But councillor Peacock said he remained opposed, telling the BBC: 'If you want to inspire patriotism amongst our young people, show the clips from the Olympics again.'\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140417ea4i0001i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 This Easter holiday weekend, thousands of fathers will spend a small fortune trying to hit a cardboard target with a pellet from a wonky air rifle. If they succeed, their lucky children will return home from the funfair clutching a goldfish in a plastic bag.\par \par \uc2 By Tuesday night, the goldfish will either be swimming around in a bowl modelled on one of those Hanna Barbera cartoon space helmets or will have been flushed down the toilet.\par \par \uc2 Goldfish are as much a part of the traditional British Easter experience as Cadbury's Creme Eggs and chocolate bunny rabbits.\par \par \uc2 I've no idea who came up with the concept of goldfish as fairground prizes, but kids seem to like them. Rag and bone men used to tour the streets on horse-drawn carts touting 'old clothes for fish'.\par \par \uc2 Boys and girls would willingly swap their dad's best Sunday suit for a manky goldfish with the life expectancy of, well, a goldfish.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to pets, give me a labrador any day of the week. As a hobby, keeping fish is right up there with cultivating mould.\par \par \uc2 If you want to gawp at brainless pond life with slack mouths staring out from behind a plate-glass screen, there's always daytime television.\par \par \uc2 What I hadn't realised until now was that buying a goldfish is fraught with as much difficulty as obtaining a shotgun licence.\par \par \uc2 Brian Heard has written to me about his recent experience at the Pets At Home store in Hove. He took his grandchildren there to buy them a couple of goldfish for their aquarium. They were approached by an assistant in a green uniform, clutching an iPad, who proceeded to ask Brian a series of questions.\par \par \uc2 Why did he want the goldfish? Did he have any fish already? Yes, four.As this impertinent interrogation unfolded, the assistant earnestly tapped the answers into the iPad.\par \par \uc2 How big was the tank in which the goldfish were to be kept? About the same as that one, Brian replied, pointing to a display tank on a nearby shelf.\par \par \uc2 In which case, the assistant said, Brian wouldn't be allowed to buy any more goldfish.\par \par \uc2 Pardon? That's a 20-litre model, and fish require a minimum of one litre of water per centimetre of length. And since goldfish can grow to 5cm, another two would exceed the maximum capacity of the tank.\par \par \uc2 Hang on a minute, Brian said, the identical tank in the shop contained dozens of fish. Ah, the assistant said, but that's for commercial not domestic use.\par \par \uc2 When Brian protested, the assistant said: 'Fish have rights, you know.' Brian left the shop empty handed, with two disappointed grandchildren in tow.\par \par \uc2 He thought I'd be interested in this story since I regularly bring you reports of shops refusing to sell stuff to people on elf'*'safety or 'proof of identity' grounds. This is certainly a new one on me. I've never heard of anyone being required to complete a questionnaire before they could buy a goldfish.\par \par \uc2 Initially, I assumed this was an isolated incident, just another example of an officious jobsworth proving my golden rule that if you give someone any kind of authority they will always, always abuse it.\par \par \uc2 But out of curiosity, I thought I'd investigate further. Turns out Brian isn't alone. There's even an online forum for people refused goldfish.\par \par \uc2 I bring you one example, verbatim, except for some deleted expletives, from a frustrated chap who calls himself 'Cornish Seagull'. It is a minor classic.\par \par \uc2 'Looking after Daughter's goldfish, one dies and decide to replace it. Go to Pets At Home and experience the bloody "Spanish inquisition"! Some bloody jobsworth asked me size of tank, what filter system did I have and wait for it . . . what experience did I have of fish?\par \par \uc2 'Explained very slowly that I was just looking after Daughter's fish and one died and NO, tank didn't have filter system but I planned to transfer fish to pond.\par \par \uc2 'Told it was company policy not to sell fish to customers without filter systems! Got asked to leave store when wife pointed out that most of their fish had fin rot and how could they moralise when their fish were in such a poor state!\par \par \uc2 'I'm 56, have had a successful career, raised two kids, had two cats (died at 15 & 16) still have two dogs and make very good jam but I can't buy a goldfish!!\par \par \uc2 'Has the world gone mad or am I missing something?' In reply to another contributor, who has had a similar problem, Cornish Seagull writes: 'I suggest you return to the shop with a club hammer and demand they sell you a goldfish or their tanks get it!'\par \par \uc2 What kind of mad world is it in which the simple business of buying a goldfish can provoke people to the point of violence? Apparently, all this stems from the 2006 Animal Welfare Act, after which the \uc2 RSPCA\uc2  issued strict guidelines about keeping fish: 'The general rule is to allow 2.5cm (1in) of fish to 4.5 litres (1 gallon) of water, with a minimum of 45 litres (10 gallons).'\par \par \uc2 I'm sure this is sensible advice, but who has got the time to measure a goldfish? For a start, they keep flapping about if you take them out of water.\par \par \uc2 On their website, Pets At Home boast of their 'responsible retailing' credentials. They'll even sell you a 'Beware of the Goldfish' sticker. They just won't sell you a goldfish.\par \par \uc2 Still, there's always the funfair, but for how long? A number of MPs, including Jack Straw and man-of-the-moment Nigel Evans, have signed a petition calling for the law to be changed to ban goldfish being given away as prizes.\par \par \uc2 Happy Easter.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0JAMAICA? NOT OF HIS OWN ACCORDLast time out it was a convicted Italian mafioso, holed up in Uxbridge, who we couldn't send home to serve his sentence because Italian jail conditions breached his 'human rights'.Now we learn that an illegal Jamaican \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  who stabbed a schoolboy to death over a drugs deal can't be deported because he's decided to announce he's gay, something he forgot to mention until now.I can't decide what's worse: the pernicious European convention which makes us a safe haven for gangsters, terrorists and killers.Or the fact that this murderer we were told was allegedly jailed for 'life' at his original trial subsequently had his sentence cut to just six years and two months.My old mate Sean McDermott has become something of a London landmark over the years. Working as a doorman at a succession of smart restaurants in all weathers, wearing his bowler hat, he's photographed by tourists almost as often as guardsmen in bearskins.You may have seen him lurking in the background during coverage of the bust-up between Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi. Tomorrow he reaches a landmark of his own and turns 60. Happy birthday, Sean.We've only just got over the horse-meat scandal when along comes another food scare. Two new surveys of takeaway meals, by the Food Standards Agency and \uc2 Which? magazine\uc2 , discovered dishes sold as lamb containing other kinds of meat. Some lamb curries were made entirely from beef, while the meat in several dishes could not be identified. As slobbish Oscar Madison says to his card school chums in Neil Simon's magnificent play The Odd Couple: 'I got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches.''What's the green?''It's either very new cheese or very old meat.'One report claims some doner kebabs contain dead rat. Chilli sauce with that, sir? Meanwhile, a kebab shop owner in Midhurst, Sussex, has just been prosecuted for what local council officers describe as one of the worst breaches of food hygiene laws they have ever seen.He answers to the name of Mustafa Dogdu. I hate to think what's in his kebabs. Scientists are proposing to put cows on a diet\u160\'00\'A0 to cut the amount of saturated fat in dairy products. What do they have in mind? Lean Cuisine? Cows eat grass \u8212\'20\'14 and it doesn't get more low-fat than that. This week's Good Health section featured a pair of shoes fitted with wheels, which are alleged to stop old people falling over.Call me old-fashioned, but aren't they what used to be known as roller-skates? And won't they have the exact opposite of the intended effect? Whenever I went out on roller-skates, I always ended up flat on my backside. If this idea catches on, there could be carnage on pension day.JOIN ME FOR LUNCHThe great joy of my job is the feedback I get from readers. This column really wouldn't be the same without you, as today's main piece illustrates.On Monday, May 12, I'll have the pleasure of meeting many of you in person at the Daily Mail's Literary Lunch at London's Royal Lancaster Hotel.I've a new book out next month, Littlejohn's Lost World, about growing up in the Fifties and Sixties and how life has changed since.From Muffin The Mule to Jimi Hendrix at the Isle of Wight pop festival, it's a story of sweet shops, school dentists, Saturday morning pictures and innocent childhood freedom which has gone for ever.Tickets are available from dailymail.co.uk/books or see Page 60 today. I do hope you can join me.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140417ea4i0000l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw125\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1875\pichgoal600

I haven't mentioned it being closed for the last few weeks because I didn't know exactly what was going on and didn't want to add to the silly misinformation that's been flying around. The main thing is that Liverpool's friendliest gay bar is back and I couldn't be happier.\par \par \uc2 There was a gaping hole in the Liverpool scene whilst The Masquerade was closed and the thought of a Liverpool Pride without the Mazzie just doesn't bear thinking about. It's very true that you really don't appreciate something until its gone so I hope that people will continue to support all of the venues on the gay scene. Speaking of which, The Navy Bar will be opening earlier this Sunday at 8pm and will be going through until 3am throughout the Easter weekend with the usual array of special offers and great music from DJs Andy Mac and John Hooper.\par \par \uc2 ? ACCORDING a new survey the UK is the 6th most tolerant country when it comes to homosexuality with less than a fifth believing that homosexuality is "morally unacceptable".\par \par \uc2 The most intolerant country was Ghana with 98%. The five countries more tolerant than the UK were Canada, Czech Republic, France Germany and Spain. Forty countries were polled in total and unfortunately in most of them people thought homosexuality was unacceptable.\par \par \uc2 We should count ourselves lucky living where we do but there are LGBT people seeking asylum in this country who are finding tolerance hard to come by. Aderonke is a Nigerian lesbian who fled to the UK after her family were killed and she was tortured and sentenced to death for being a lesbian.\par \par \uc2 On arrival in the UK she faced a humiliating interrogation from UK \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  officers who did not believe she was a lesbian. She's now waiting on the decision of a judge who could order her back to Nigeria where her life wouldn't definitely be in danger.\par \par \uc2 There is a petition calling on Home Secretary Theresa May to review the case and to change the way LGBT asylum seekers are treated at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.allout.org/aderonke"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 www.allout.org/aderonke}}}\uc2 .

He said Carpenter had been barred because he lacked a sponsor's certificate but he conceded: "Although the guidelines and policies were correctly followed by officers, Border Force accepts that more could have been done to assist Mr Carpenter."\par \par \uc2 A Border Force spokesman said: "It is the responsibility of those wanting to come to the UK to state the purpose of their visit and if required provide supporting documentation.\par \par \uc2 "We have looked into the circumstances of this case. Mr Carpenter did not have the documentation he needed to enter the UK when he arrived at Birmingham Airport and was therefore returned to Germany.\par \par \uc2 "At Heathrow he sought leave to enter the country under a different category, for which he did have the valid documentation."\par \par \uc2 Document EVEMAI0020140418ea4i00033\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 RightMinds\par \b \uc2 RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: Life's too short to measure a goldfish\b0\par\par\uc2 RICHARD LITTLEJOHN   \par \uc2 1,620 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 April 2014\par 02:57\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 This Easter holiday \u173\'00\'ADweek\u173\'00\'ADend, thousands of fathers will spend a small fortune \u173\'00\'ADtrying to hit a cardboard target with a pellet from a wonky air rifle. If they succeed, their lucky children will return home from the funfair clutching a goldfish in a plastic bag.\par \par \uc2 By Tuesday night, the goldfish will either be swimming around in a bowl modelled on one of those Hanna-Barbera cartoon space \u173\'00\'ADhelmets or will have been flushed down the toilet.\par \par \uc2 Goldfish are as much a part of the \u173\'00\'ADtraditional British Easter experience as Cadbury\u8217\'20\'19s Creme Eggs and chocolate bunny rabbits.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19ve no idea who came up with the concept of goldfish as fairground prizes, but kids seem to like them. Rag and bone men used to tour the streets on horse-drawn carts touting \u8216\'20\'18old clothes for fish\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Boys and girls would willingly swap their dad\u8217\'20\'19s best Sunday suit for a manky goldfish with the life expectancy of, well, a goldfish.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to pets, give me a labrador any day of the week. As a hobby, keeping fish is right up there with cultivating mould.\par \par \uc2 If you want to gawp at brainless \u173\'00\'ADpond life with slack mouths staring out from behind a plate-glass screen, there\u8217\'20\'19s always daytime television.\par \par \uc2 What I hadn\u8217\'20\'19t realised until now was that buying a goldfish is fraught with as much \u173\'00\'ADdifficulty as obtaining a shotgun licence.\par \par \uc2 Brian Heard has written to me about his recent experience at the Pets At Home store in Hove. He took his grandchildren there to buy them a couple of goldfish for their \u173\'00\'ADaquarium. They were approached by an assistant in a green uniform, clutching an iPad, who proceeded to ask Brian a series of questions.\par \par \uc2 Why did he want the goldfish? Did he have any fish already? Yes, four.As this impertinent interrogation unfolded, the assistant earnestly tapped the answers into the iPad.\par \par \uc2 How big was the tank in which the goldfish were to be kept? About the same as that one, Brian replied, pointing to a \u173\'00\'ADdisplay tank on a nearby shelf.\par \par \uc2 In which case, the assistant said, Brian wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be allowed to buy any more goldfish.\par \par \uc2 Pardon? That\u8217\'20\'19s a 20-litre model, and fish require a minimum of one litre of water per centimetre of length. And since goldfish can grow to 5cm, another two would exceed the maximum capacity of the tank.\par \par \uc2 Hang on a minute, Brian said, the identical tank in the shop contained dozens of fish. Ah, the assistantsaid, but that\u8217\'20\'19s for commercial not domestic use.\par \par \uc2 When Brian protested, the \u173\'00\'ADassistant said: \u8216\'20\'18Fish have rights,you know.\u8217\'20\'19 Brian left the shop empty handed, with two disappointed grandchildren in tow.\par \par \uc2 He thought I\u8217\'20\'19d be interested in this story since I regularly bring you reports of shops \u173\'00\'ADrefusing to sell stuff to people on elf\u8217\'20\'19n\u8217\'20\'19safety or \u8216\'20\'18proof of identity\u8217\'20\'19 grounds. This is \u173\'00\'ADcertainly a new one on me. I\u8217\'20\'19ve never heard of anyone being required to complete a questionnaire before they could buy a goldfish.\par \par \uc2 Initially, I assumed this was an isolated incident, just another example of an officious jobsworth proving my golden rule that if you give someone any kind of authority they will always, always abuse it.\par \par \uc2 But out of curiosity, I thought I\u8217\'20\'19d investigate further. Turns out Brian isn\u8217\'20\'19t alone. There\u8217\'20\'19s even an online forum for people refused goldfish.\par \par \uc2 I bring you one example, verbatim, except for some deleted expletives, from a frustrated chap who calls himself \u8216\'20\'18Cornish Seagull\u8217\'20\'19. It is a minor classic.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Looking after Daughter\u8217\'20\'19s goldfish, one dies and decide to replace it. Go to Pets At Home and experience the bloody \u8220\'20\'1CSpanish inquisition\u8221\'20\'1D! Some bloody \u173\'00\'ADjobsworth asked me size of tank, what filter system did I have and wait for it\u8197\'20\'05.\u8197\'20\'05.\u8197\'20\'05.\u8197\'20\'05what experience did I have of fish?\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Explained very slowly that I was just looking after Daughter\u8217\'20\'19s fish and one died and NO, tank didn\u8217\'20\'19t have filter system but I planned to transfer fish to pond.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Told it was company policy not to sell fish to customers without filter systems! Got asked to leave store when wife pointed out that most of their fish had fin rot and how could they moralise when their fish were in such a poor state!\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19m 56, have had a successful career, raised two kids, had two cats (died at 15 & 16) still have two dogs and make very good jam but I can\u8217\'20\'19t buy a goldfish!!\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Has the world gone mad or am I missing something?\u8217\'20\'19 In reply to another contributor, who has had a similar problem, Cornish Seagull writes: \u8216\'20\'18I suggest you return to the shop with a club hammer and demand they sell you a goldfish or their tanks get it!\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 What kind of mad world is it in which the simple business of buying a goldfish can provoke people to the point of violence? Apparently, all this stems from the 2006 Animal Welfare Act, after which the \uc2 RSPCA\uc2  issued strict guidelines about \u173\'00\'ADkeeping fish: \u8216\'20\'18The general rule is to allow 2.5cm (1in) of fish to 4.5\u8197\'20\'05litres (1\u8197\'20\'05gallon) of water, with a minimum of 45\u8197\'20\'05litres (10\u8197\'20\'05gallons).\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m sure this is sensible advice, but who has got the time to measure a goldfish? For a start, they keep \u173\'00\'ADflapping about if you take them out of water.\par \par \uc2 On their website, Pets At Home boast of their \u8216\'20\'18responsible retailing\u8217\'20\'19 credentials. They\u8217\'20\'19ll even sell you a \u8216\'20\'18Beware of the Goldfish\u8217\'20\'19 sticker. They just won\u8217\'20\'19t sell you a goldfish.\par \par \uc2 Still, there\u8217\'20\'19s always the funfair, but for how long? A number of MPs, including Jack Straw and man-of-the-moment Nigel Evans, have signed a petition calling for the law to be changed to ban goldfish being given away as prizes.\par \par \uc2 Happy Easter.\par \par \uc2 Scientists are proposing to put cows on a diet to cut the amount of saturated fat in dairy products.\par \par \uc2 What do they have in mind? Lean Cuisine? Cows eat grass \u8212\'20\'14 and it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t get more low-fat than that.\par \par \uc2 Jamaica? Not of his own accord\par \par \uc2 Last time out it was a \u173\'00\'ADconvicted Italian mafioso, holed up in Uxbridge, who we couldn\u8217\'20\'19t send home to serve his sentence because Italian jail conditions breached his \u8216\'20\'18human rights\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 Now we learn that an illegal Jamaican \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  who stabbed a schoolboy to death over a drugs deal can\u8217\'20\'19t be deported because he\u8217\'20\'19s decided to announce he\u8217\'20\'19s gay, \u173\'00\'ADsomething he forgot to \u173\'00\'ADmention until now.\par \par \uc2 I can\u8217\'20\'19t decide what\u8217\'20\'19s worse: the pernicious European \u173\'00\'ADconvention which makes us a safe haven for gangsters, \u173\'00\'ADterrorists and killers.\par \par \uc2 Or the fact that this \u173\'00\'ADmurderer we were told was allegedly jailed for \u8216\'20\'18life\u8217\'20\'19 at his original trial subsequently had his sentence cut to just six years and two months.\par \par \uc2 We\u8217\'20\'19ve only just got over the horse-meat scandal when along comes another food scare. Two new surveys of takeaway meals, by the Food Standards Agency and \uc2 Which? magazine\uc2 , discovered dishes sold as lamb containing other kinds of meat.\par \par \uc2 Some lamb curries were made entirely from beef, while the meat in several dishes could not be identified. As slobbish Oscar Madison says to his card school chums in Neil Simon\u8217\'20\'19s magnificent play The Odd Couple: \u8216\'20\'18I got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18What\u8217\'20\'19s the green?\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It\u8217\'20\'19s either very new cheese or very old meat.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 One report claims some doner kebabs contain dead rat. Chilli sauce with that, sir? Meanwhile, a kebab shop owner in Midhurst, Sussex, has just been prosecuted for what local council officers describe as one of the worst breaches of food hygiene laws they have ever seen.\par \par \uc2 He answers to the name of Mustafa Dogdu. I hate to think what\u8217\'20\'19s in his kebabs.\par \par \uc2 This week\u8217\'20\'19s Good Health section featured a pair of shoes fitted with wheels, which are alleged to stop old people falling over.\par \par \uc2 Call me old-fashioned, but aren\u8217\'20\'19t they what used to be known as roller-skates? And won\u8217\'20\'19t they have the exact opposite of the intended effect?\par \par \uc2 Whenever I went out on roller-skates, I always ended up flat on my backside. If this idea catches on, there could be carnage on pension day.\par \par \uc2 Join me for lunch\par \par \uc2 The great joy of my job is the feedback I get from readers. This column really wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be the same without you, as today\u8217\'20\'19s main piece illustrates.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, May 12, I\u8217\'20\'19ll have the pleasure of meeting many of you in person at the Daily Mail\u8217\'20\'19s Literary Lunch at \u173\'00\'ADLondon\u8217\'20\'19s Royal Lancaster Hotel.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19ve a new book out next month, Littlejohn\u8217\'20\'19s Lost World, about growing up in the Fifties and Sixties and how life has changed since.\par \par \uc2 From Muffin The Mule to Jimi Hendrix at the Isle of Wight pop festival, it\u8217\'20\'19s a story of sweet shops, school dentists, Saturday morning pictures and innocent childhood freedom which has gone for ever.\par \par \uc2 Tickets are available from dailymail.co.uk/books or see Page 60 today. I do hope you can join me.\par \par \uc2 My old mate Sean McDermott has become something of a London landmark over the years. Working as a doorman at a succession of smart restaurants in all weathers, wearing his bowler hat, he\u8217\'20\'19s photographed by tourists almost as often as guardsmen in bearskins.\par \par \uc2 You may have seen him lurking in the background during coverage of the bust-up between Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi. Tomorrow he reaches a landmark of his own and turns 60.

I quit college so Dad suggested I go into our family garden-landscaping business.\par \par \uc2 I was sent to draw up a plan when we had an order to redesign the garden for a posh house in our town.\par \par \uc2 I rang the doorbell and noticed a \uc2 BMW\uc2  and Merc in the driveway and was amazed when this girl I knew from school opened the door \u8212\'20\'14 and she was clearly the owner, not the maid.\par \par \uc2 She\u8217\'20\'19s a few years older than me and I used to fantasise about her back at school.\par \par \uc2 I did the measuring up and she offered me a cup of tea.\par \par \uc2 She suddenly turned round while the kettle boiled and started kissing me.\par \par \uc2 She had recognised me and we ended up having sex there and then and carried on right through the night, into the early hours.\par \par \uc2 I asked how she ended up living in such a lovely house. It turns out she\u8217\'20\'19s with a 50-year-old guy with loads of money.\par \par \uc2 He works away for months at a time and she said she is only with him for the lavish lifestyle.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19ve seen her a few times since and she wants us to be lovers and says she\u8217\'20\'19d set me up in a flat in the centre of town so we can party day and night.\par \par \uc2 I have a girlfriend and would finish with her but I don\u8217\'20\'19t know if this fling will last.\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: I doubt it. Maybe the sex seems special because she\u8217\'20\'19s glamorous and rich but if she wasn\u8217\'20\'19t, would you still be attracted to her?\par \par \uc2 If you think you really do like her, say you\u8217\'20\'19d think about a relationship if she were free.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile look at your relationship with your girlfriend. Either put some energy into it so you feel more committed or call it a day and free her to find someone else.\par \par \uc2 He looks at girls online Dear Deidre\par \par \uc2 MY boyfriend won\u8217\'20\'19t stop looking at girls on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 We\u8217\'20\'19ve been together for 15 months. He\u8217\'20\'19s 34, I\u8217\'20\'19m 43. I went online and found a girl\u8217\'20\'19s profile page he\u8217\'20\'19d been checking.\par \par \uc2 It was someone he was interested in before we got together. I know he has girls on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  as friends but this girl was special to him.\par \par \uc2 I asked him later if he was happy with me and he said yes, so I asked why he\u8217\'20\'19d been checking this girl\u8217\'20\'19s profile. He said it wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t happen again.\par \par \uc2 A week later I found he\u8217\'20\'19d been looking at a photo on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  of a scantily dressed girl from a town he visits regularly.\par \par \uc2 He said it was from before we met but it had only just been put on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . Can I trust him?\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: Tell him it\u8217\'20\'19s hurtful for you and that part of being in a relationship is making choices \u8211\'20\'13 giving up flirting on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , for example, for the sake of real love.\par \par \uc2 Be clear this is his last chance and mean it. If he does it again, my leaflet Moving On will help you.\par \par \uc2 Monthly sex Dear Deidre\par \par \uc2 WHAT started out as no-strings sex has become strings and no sex with my fella.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m 22 and he\u8217\'20\'19s 24. We\u8217\'20\'19ve been together for a year after first meeting up just for sex. I need an active sex life but ours has gone from daily to once a month if I\u8217\'20\'19m lucky.\par \par \uc2 I need sex to feel close to him but it\u8217\'20\'19s causing lots of arguments between us.\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: He could be finding it hard to sustain intimacy in a lasting relationship.\par \par \uc2 Or he might be stressed or depressed, which both tend to knock out sex drive.\par \par \uc2 Tell him you love him and miss the physical closeness. Be loving and tactile without rushing to make sexual demands.\par \par \uc2 That may warm him up. If nothing improves suggest he have a check with his GP. Plus an advice line today explains practical help.\par \par \uc2 Gay \u8211\'20\'13 and dead if I go back home Dear Deidre\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19M scared I\u8217\'20\'19ll be killed for being gay if I go back to my country.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m a 22-year-old guy and I came to London as a student from Africa because of the gay scene here. I thought I could marry a gay guy or enter into a civil partnership and then I wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t have to leave the UK.\par \par \uc2 I found a man but then suddenly we split up. If I go back to my country I will be murdered. Should I try to find another guy or apply for asylum based on my sexuality?\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: A relationship you\u8217\'20\'19ve rushed into for the sake of staying in the UK isn\u8217\'20\'19t likely to work. Being married or in a civil partnership doesn\u8217\'20\'19t give you automatic rights.\par \par \uc2 To get asylum you will need to prove you are genuinely gay and at risk of persecution in your country.\par \par \uc2 You need a solicitor who understands this area of law.

It\u8217\'20\'19s so annoying.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m 21 and he\u8217\'20\'19s 30. He has a three-year-old girl from a previous relationship. She is very fond of me but I get wound up with the way my partner treats her when she stays over. There\u8217\'20\'19s no discipline and she rules the roost.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19ve tried talking to him about his daughter\u8217\'20\'19s behaviour but he gets very defensive because his ex constantly questions his parenting skills. He says he doesn\u8217\'20\'19t need criticism from me too.\par \par \uc2 We plan to marry and have kids one day. How am I expected to live with them if I can\u8217\'20\'19t tell his daughter off? I\u8217\'20\'19m also concerned that when we have our own kids there will be different treatment for her and mine.\par \par \uc2 I will discipline my own kids how I see fit, but I won\u8217\'20\'19t, it seems, be able to set the same rules for her.\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: It\u8217\'20\'19s true that all children need firm boundaries but you have to remember she is only three.\par \par \uc2 Children that age need steering and managing rather than telling off.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Talking of God can look like cynical electioneering, even when it's not\par \par \uc2 There are many arguments you can advance in favour of separating Church and State in Britain. One concerns the diplomatic and theological minefields to be negotiated when the head of state meets the Pope, the heir to the throne remarries, or the Prime Minister of the day feels the call to Catholicism. A second would relate to the growing diversity of the population. A third would cite the periodic spats that erupt between cashstrapped governments and Archbishops of Canterbury who preach compassion.\par \par \uc2 But at least as compelling an argument for disestablishing the Church of England would be the embarrassment that radiates from a Prime Minister who from time to time feels the urge to wear his religious heart on his sleeve.\par \par \uc2 Or perhaps that should be his "sort of religious" heart - which is not to question anyone's sincerity, just the lukewarm essence of established Anglicanism. Alastair Campbell was so right to steer Tony Blair away from "doing God"; here was one scrape at least that he avoided.\par \par \uc2 Not so, his successor but one at No 10. In his Easter article for the Church Times, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  comes across as a thoroughly typical Anglican - a bit of this, a bit of that, not too demonstrative, not too certain; someone who appreciatively sends his children to CofE schools while apparently wishing that he, and his Church, were more assertive about the whole thing.\par \par \uc2 And he does his best. "Some people," he writes, "feel that in this ever more secular age we shouldn't talk about these things. I completely disagree. I believe we should be more confident about our status as a Christian country, more ambitious about expanding the role of faithbased organisations, and, frankly, more evangelical about a faith that compels us to get out there and make a difference to people's lives."\par \par \uc2 After which he hastily goes on to say that greater confidence about Britain as a Christian country does not entail "doing down" those of others faiths, or none at all.\par \par \uc2 "Many people tell me it is easier to be Jewish or Muslim in Britain than in a secular country, precisely because the tolerance that Christianity demands of our society provides greater space for other religious faiths, too."\par \par \uc2 You can see the difficulty. As Prime Minister of a country with an established church of which he is a member, an increasingly secular outlook and growing non-Christian minorities, Cameron is in tricky territory if he wants to recommend that Britain should be more confi-dent about its Christian identity.\par \par \uc2 I rather wish that he did not feel the need to try, and left it to the Queen to distribute the Maundy money, as she did yesterday in Blackburn (a city with the thirdhighest proportion of Muslims in the country).\par \par \uc2 It is possible to respect Cameron for putting his religious faith out there, not least in the quite modest and very British way in which he did in the Church Times, while suspecting that purposes other than personal witness and observance of Eastertide might be at work. That is the trouble about being Prime Minister and talking not about faith in the abstract, but about your own.\par \par \uc2 Because even if he did not mean to score any political points, this is how his contribution can be construed. With European elections a little more than a month away and a general election in a year's time, the spectre of Ukip looms large.\par \par \uc2 While denying that his party is anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as such, Nigel Farage would not dispute that it is about national identity, and that identity for many of its potential voters and wavering Conservatives would encompass a brand of Anglicanism a la Cameron. So it is useful, to put it no more strongly, for the Conservative leader to have this on the record in nice time for Easter.\par \par \uc2 Similarly with compassion. As benefits reform advances, steered unapologetically by Iain Duncan Smith, so those who see its practical - or political - downsides mobilise to get their view across. The Christian churches, galvanised by the new Archbishop of Canterbury, have made much of the running, including in an open letter published earlier this week, signed by 42 Anglican bishops and more than 600 others, calling for action to stop people going hungry in the UK.\par \par \uc2 No matter that international figures show both food poverty, and child poverty, in Britain declining, or that the Coalition has an electoral mandate for reducing welfare spending. The perception is that benefit changes are driving thousands to food banks, and it is no good Cameron spouting George Bush-style "compassionate conservatism".\par \par \uc2 Even as the economic recovery threatens to make its life awkward, Labour can take comfort from the return of the "nasty party". Taken at face value or as politics, Cameron's profession of faith and benevolence to all this Easter will not be enough to turn the tide. In this, he might done better to emulate Blair, in keeping God and Caesar - at least for public purposes - apart.\par \par \uc2 i@independent.co.uk\par \par \uc2 It's possible to respect Cameron for putting his faith out there but still suspect his purposes\par \par \uc2 Document IIND000020140418ea4i0000h\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Bolton pupils to sing national anthem\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ian Johnston   \par \uc2 126 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 April 2014\par \uc2 i\par \uc2 IIND\par \uc2 1ST\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd.

Most efforts to dramatise the \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  experience in film, theatre and literature show people mired in neurosis about their identity, always at pains to reconcile their inherited culture with the ways of a modern western country, always anxious at their limited success in doing so.\par \par \uc2 This was the theme of much of the best writing of the 20th century, especially in America, where the likes of Saul Bellow and Philip Roth turned Jewish outsiders into the Oliver Twists and David Copperfields of the day. From The Buddha of Suburbia to White Teeth , both adapted to screen, this is also the recent history of British storytelling. The problem with all this is that it only captures one type of \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  experience.\par \par \uc2 There is another, simpler kind, in which people arrive in Britain, work hard, get on and never find themselves lost in an existential quandary about "who they are". They are so seamlessly assimilated as to be unaware of having done any assimilation. This is the story of Mr Javid and his father. It is the story of lots of modern Britons, from Poland, Sri Lanka and most places in between. Their stories are untold but they are living realities.\par \par \uc2 janan.ganesh@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020140417ea4h0002m\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Illegal \uc2 immigrant\uc2  who strangled and raped his pregnant girlfriend then wrote 'die b***h' above her head after she told him to leave their home is jailed for 26 years\b0\par\par\uc2 TARA BRADY   \par \uc2 1,249 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 April 2014\par 19:42\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

She told her something had happened the previous evening but did not say what.\par \par \uc2 'On another occasion the defendant also admitted pushing Sarah over, causing large purple bruises, when it was witnessed by a friend.\par \par \uc2 'Sarah told friends the defendant would also have sex with her even when she told him no.\par \par \uc2 'Sarah\u8217\'20\'19s friends knew she wanted the relationship over and wanted him to leave her, but the defendant had stayed at the flat because she did not want to "just kick him out on the street'.\par \par \uc2 'She told another friend Novarette had been violent towards her, and was obviously desperate for the\par \par \uc2 defendant to leave and was very scared of him.'\par \par \uc2 The couple finally came to blows after Sarah revealed she was in the early stages of pregnancy but did not want to keep the baby because of his violent nature.\par \par \uc2 On January 7, the day before her murder, Sarah was staying at a friend\u8217\'20\'19s when Novarette, who had been out drinking all day, sent a series of text messages calling her a 'baby killer' and a 'f***king\par \par \uc2 whore'.\par \par \uc2 In response Sarah told Novarette to pack his things and leave by the morning, before leaving her\par \par \uc2 friend\u8217\'20\'19s house at 12.30am to 'sort things out' with him.\par \par \uc2 Her last text message to the friend, at 3.20am, confirmed that Novarette had agreed to leave the\par \par \uc2 following morning and all was okay.\par \par \uc2 But, less than eight hours later, Novarette, who had a more than 350mg of alcohol in his blood at the\par \par \uc2 time of his arrest, telephoned police to reveal his violent crime.\par \par \uc2 Mr Vaitilingam added: 'She was clothed from the waist up but her upper clothing was pushed up exposing both of her breasts.\par \par \uc2 'Blood was smeared all over her body and she was pronounced dead at the scene. The words \u8216\'20\'18die bitch\u8217\'20\'19 were written in Spanish in red ink on the head board of the bed.\par \par \uc2 'The defendant accepted it was his writing, he had clearly written it that night.'\par \par \uc2 Hours after the horrific attack, drunken Novarette rang a friend to tell him he had 'gone too far' and\par \par \uc2 'crossed the line' before calling police to confess his crime.\par \par \uc2 When officers arrived he told them 'I choked her' and later asked, 'how long do you get for murder?'\par \par \uc2 when he arrived at the station.\par \par \uc2 Richard Smith QC, defending, said his client had a serious problem with alcohol and had drunk a 'huge amount even by his own standards of drinking' on the night of the murder.\par \par \uc2 He also said Novarette told officer he had taken ketamine, although no evidence was found, which could have caused him to make a 'terrible' misjudgement of people.\par \par \uc2 When he was arrested the following morning he was four-and-a-half times the drink drive limit.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 He had also taken horse tranquilliser Ketamine and only called police when still under the influence\par \par \uc2 of the drug.\par \par \uc2 Sarah also miscarried as she died in a pool of blood, the court heard.\par \par \uc2 The court heard that Novarette had sex with her either at the time of death or shortly afterwards\par \par \uc2 before leaving her body in the bedroom.\par \par \uc2 The killer was living in the UK illegally after coming to the country from Mexico in December 2012 and\par \par \uc2 had a long history of alcoholism.\par \par \uc2 Caring Sarah had taken him in as he was unable to earn money legally.\par \par \uc2 She had a 21-month-old son by a former partner and fell pregnant again by Novarette in late 2013.\par \par \uc2 In a victim impact statement read out in court, Sarah\u8217\'20\'19s mother Vivian O\u8217\'20\'19Neill said: 'At a time like\par \par \uc2 this words are hard to find.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 'We are heartbroken and devastated at the loss of Sarah.

People suffered intense loss, homes were destroyed by bombing and fighting and food ran short. But despite these terrible things, most of those that took part remained committed to the war until the very end. The civilians back home continued to believe in the justice of their cause as strongly as the men at the front.\par \par \uc2 One of the reasons for this was their careful manipulation by governments that needed everyone to believe that their struggle was right and their sacrifices were equally shared. To do this civilian and military leaders had to find a vehicle for mass communication, something that both stirred the hearts and stimulated the minds of their nations. Not yet equipped with radio or cinema, let alone television, the medium they used with remarkable skill was the poster.\par \par \uc2 Across the years 1914 to 1918, no other form of popular appeal had such a profound effect on the lives of ordinary people as the poster. Posters were everywhere: in railway stations, in city centres, on buses and on walls, subliminally influencing people as they walked casually down the street. Each nation had its own distinct styles and designs. But their purpose was all the same: to bind people together and to uphold their consent in the war.\par \par \uc2 Since its foundation in 1917 the \uc2 Imperial War Museum\uc2  has collected thousands of First World War posters. Now we have brought a selection of these together as a book, some of which you can see here. It is not a comprehensive account of how posters developed or steered global populations at times of crisis, but gives a feel for the dynamism and energy of this popular medium at possibly the zenith of its influence.\par \par \uc2 These posters provide a sharp and vibrant reflection of the underlying beliefs and values of a devastating global event and remain arresting and appealing to this day. The artists and printers who created them established enduring works of popular art that still convey the strength and determination to prevail of every country. They remind us of the real tragedy of the First World War: that the people of so many nations across Europe and the rest of the world believed their own cause to be right and the war to be just.\par \par \uc2 Nigel Steel is principal historian of the \uc2 Imperial War Museum\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s First World War Centenary Programme. A longer version of this introduction appears in Posters of the First World War (IWM, \u163\'00\'A39.99), published May 10\par \par \uc2 1914-18: Poster boys for the war to end all wars\par \par \uc2 Richard Slocombe\par \par \uc2 1. James Montgomery Flagg\par \par \uc2 I Want You for \uc2 US Army\uc2 , 1917 (US)\par \par \uc2 Most likely this poster is derived from the Alfred Leete version for the British Army. He was interested in and inspired by the Kitchener image but Flagg dressed up as Uncle Sam himself \u8212\'20\'14 that is actually an image of the artist. This image was so successful it was used again in the Second World War and is still used today \u8212\'20\'14 it hangs outside all \uc2 US Army\uc2  recruitment offices. It was also subverted during the Vietnam war \u8212\'20\'14 one called I Want Out showed a wounded Uncle Sam. It became a real counter-culture image in the Sixties, part of how the First World War was perceived then, on its 50th anniversary.\par \par \uc2 2. Fred Spear\par \par \uc2 ENLIST, 1915 (US)\par \par \uc2 This is a good example of what is typical about American posters. They\u8217\'20\'19re very emotive, they don\u8217\'20\'19t hold back. You wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t see an image like this in a British poster at the time. Advertising was frowned upon here in a way it wasn\u8217\'20\'19t in the States. This uses the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 \u8212\'20\'14 128 Americans died on the ship, out of a total loss of 1,1,98, when it was torpedoed by a German U Boat \u8212\'20\'14 and was fundamental in shifting US allegiance towards the allied cause. At the beginning of the war it looked as if they might back Germany \u8212\'20\'14 America had a big German \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  population and wasn\u8217\'20\'19t naturally aligned to Britain and France. This was the tipping point.\par \par \uc2 3. Julius Gipkens\par \par \uc2 Delka: German Air-War Trophies, 1917 (Germany)\par \par \uc2 This really sums up the German attitude to war, and to airborne war in particular. What you see here is actually an advert for a show of captured British aircraft being held in a zoo. It was quite apt \u8212\'20\'14 the planes are presented as trophies, like caged animals. What it really shows is a sense of inherent superiority in the German pilots. This is why they are presented as grand eagles standing on the British air force roundel, as if they are great natural hunters. It\u8217\'20\'19s an incredibly nationalistic, Wagnerian image.\par \par \uc2 4. Unknown\par \par \uc2 Newcao: Nutritious Breakfast par Excellence, 1917 (France)\par \par \uc2 This is an example of how the war was used to sell products. It presents the French prime minister Georges Clemenceau, who took office in 1917, when France was in the doldrums: its army had mutinied, its defences had failed and so there was a lot of defeatism in France at that time. When Clemenceau came in he was nicknamed \u8220\'20\'1Cthe tiger\u8221\'20\'1D because of his bellicose approach that really got France back in the war. Here he\u8217\'20\'19s being used to sell a breakfast that rejuvenates you and gives you the vigour of \u8220\'20\'1Cthe tiger\u8221\'20\'1D Clemenceau.\par \par \uc2 5. Norman Alfred William Lindsay\par \par \uc2 The Question Mark, 1918 (Australia)\par \par \uc2 This was the war that defined Australia. Though loyal to the British cause, they committed to the war on their own terms: fighting for freedom, not just to support Britain. Not introducing conscription but relying on volunteers was fundamental to this assertion of self-determinism. This poster was one of five released sequentially in top secret and posted during the night. This was the first one, depicting Germany as a force of barbarism with blood on its hands. The question mark asks: will you settle for this?\par \par \uc2 6. Alfred Leete\par \par \uc2 Britons: Join Your Country\u8217\'20\'19s Army! (Great Britain)\par \par \uc2 This image was originally a magazine cover for the London Opinion and it was that image that bore the immortal legend Your Country Needs You. The poster that we see doesn\u8217\'20\'19t actually say that and was also never actually an official poster. The consensus is that it was probably never seen outside London but the myth of its widespread reach has been exaggerated by the popularity of the \uc2 US Army\uc2  version.\par \par \uc2 7. Howard Chandler Christy\par \par \uc2 If You Want to Fight! Join the Marines, 1918 (US)\par \par \uc2 Christy was a prominent magazine illustrator and his \u8220\'20\'1CChristy girls\u8221\'20\'1D were already very popular. She was an invented female archetype \u8212\'20\'14 the girl next door type \u8212\'20\'14 already embedded in the American consciousness. Here she is being recruited for war purposes and there is a coy sexuality about having her dress up in men\u8217\'20\'19s uniform. It\u8217\'20\'19s a titillating image as well as a subliminal taunt: if a girl could fight she would, why won\u8217\'20\'19t you?\par \par \uc2 8. Frank Brangwyn\par \par \uc2 Put Strength in the Final Blow. Buy War Bonds , 1918 (Great Britain)\par \par \uc2 A very graphic image showing the act of killing: this is a rare example of British posters not being restrained. The Kaiser was so outraged he sentenced Brangwyn to death in absentia. It is most likely that this poster was used in the \uc2 London Underground\uc2 . Frank Pick, the head of \uc2 London Underground\uc2  at the time, had banned all official recruitment posters but commissioned his own instead, many by Brangwyn. This poster would probably have been landscape and huge in size, like the posters that cover the tube today.\par \par \uc2 Richard Slocombe, the senior curator of art at the \uc2 Imperial War Museum\uc2 , was talking to Marie-Claire Chappet\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140415ea4g003v2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The paramilitary units roamed the streets with seeming impunity until there was a government crackdown against the group spurred by the murder last September of the Greek musician and anti-fascist activist Pavlos Fyssas.

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 'Poverty porn' reputation leaves Channel 4 struggling to cast a second Benefits Street: Possible residents of new settings refuse to take part: \uc2 Immigration\uc2  programme plan also faces rejection\b0\par\par\uc2 Tara Conlan   \par \uc2 945 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 April 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The notoriety of Channel 4's documentary Benefits Street has left the show's producers facing an uphill task trying to persuade people to take part in a second series as well as a spin-off programme about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Programme-makers scouting potential locations for another series of the controversial programme in Stockton-on-Tees, and a separate documentary with a working title \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Street in Southampton, have faced opposition from politicians and community leaders.\par \par \uc2 When it aired earlier this year Benefits Street attracted widespread controversy, with critics branding it "poverty porn". It received 1,800 viewers' complaints. Some residents claimed they had been misled about the thrust of the programme and that producers deliberately withheld the title from them.\par \par \uc2 But others said the programme, which featured the residents of James Turner Street in Winson Green, Birmingham, shone a light on an otherwise hidden part of Britain. It also became Channel 4's most popular programme since the 2012 Paralympics, attracting audiences of more than 5 million.\par \par \uc2 But the row over the first series is making it harder for documentary-makers to return to the same theme, with Grimsby residents also opposing the filming of a second series of the Channel 4 documentary Skint.\par \par \uc2 The Northern Echo reported this week that staff from Love Productions, the company behind Benefits Street - "two young women, both dressed down in leggings and jumpers but with cut-glass southern accents" - had been talking to the residents of Dixon Street in Stockton-on-Tees.\par \par \uc2 Alex Cunningham, the Labour MP for Stockton North, told the paper he had written to Channel 4 executives asking them to scrap the show. He said TV producers had previously been given short shrift when trying to persuade the residents of North Ormesby and Brambles Farm in Middlesbrough to take part.\par \par \uc2 Kieran Smith, Love Productions' factual creative director, told the Guardian yesterday that the controversy over Benefits Street had made the search for a location for the second series harder but remained hopeful one would be found.\par \par \uc2 "It's still fairly early days. I'd like to settle on somewhere soon . . . I think we will find one, but it's more difficult," Smith admitted.\par \par \uc2 He added that Love, which also makes BBC2 hit show The Great British Bake Off, has been talking to people in Stockton but "we continue to look in other areas". He said the company had found that often having spoken to participants who initially seemed keen, a few days later "someone's got to them and put the fear of God into them".\par \par \uc2 He said that the company had been looking for some time in north-east England. "It's really important to show parts of Britain that aren't normally on TV. That's why we went to Birmingham [for the first series of Benefits Street] as it's never really on television."\par \par \uc2 In addition to making a follow-up to Benefits Street, Love Productions is also developing a series about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , after the mostly positive reaction from audiences and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to the second episode of the series, which focused on Romanians living in James Turner Street.\par \par \uc2 The company has been scouting for participants for \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Street in Derby Road in Southampton but, although it is a separate show to Benefits Street, owing to the similar title it has already hit local headlines and caused some concern within the community.\par \par \uc2 Harjap Singh, chairman of Sikh Council Hampshire and Southampton Gurdwara Council, told the Daily Echo: "We are against it because it would be pretty bad for community relations."\par \par \uc2 Southampton council\uc2  leader Simon Letts said: "I think this sort of reality television show, which is finding entertainment out of individual cases, rarely has something good come out of it. We have never had issues with race relations and we would not want that to be put at risk."\par \par \uc2 Smith responded on BBC Radio 5 Live yesterday , saying: "We thought there was something to do about what happens to \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  when they arrive in this country who are looking to be part of British society. We thought Derby Road was an interesting area that reflects what happens when \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  move into an area and change the look of an area."\par \par \uc2 Smith later told the Guardian that \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Street was still in development and had not yet been commissioned by Channel 4.\par \par \uc2 A Channel 4 spokeswoman said: "We have not yet commissioned \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Street. It's a paid-for development."\par \par \uc2 Benefits Street made household names of some of the participants, particularly Deirdre Kelly, nicknamed White Dee, who went on to appear on Newsnight and live debates on Channel 4 and Channel 5.\par \par \uc2 However, Benefits Street is currently being investigated by regulator \uc2 Ofcom\uc2  owing to the huge number of complaints.\par \par \uc2 Last year Channel 4 aired a series called Skint, which looked at how some residents in Scunthorpe survive without work. When the production company behind the show, Keo, tried to film a second series, this time in Grimsby, there was strong local opposition, with one local woman telling a public meeting on the issue: "We do not want to be the next James Turner Street."\par \par \uc2 Channel 4 is pushing ahead with a second series, but Katie Buchanan, head of documentaries at Keo, has said she believed her firm has been a victim of the fallout from Benefits Street.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Deirdre Kelly, right, who was nicknamed White Dee, became a household name after featuring in Benefits Street\par \par \uc2 Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140417ea4h0000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Frontpage\par \b \uc2 David Cameron needs to tread very carefully when \u8216\'20\'18doing God\u8217\'20\'19, especially when it looks like a way of countering Ukip\b0\par\par\uc2 Mary Dejevsky   \par \uc2 1,261 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 April 2014\par 18:36\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The PM comes across as a thoroughly typical Anglican - a bit of this, a bit of that\par \par \uc2 There are many arguments you can advance in favour of separating Church and State in Britain. One concerns the diplomatic and theological minefields to be negotiated when the head of state meets the Pope, the heir to the throne re-marries, or the Prime Minister of the day feels the call to Catholicism. A second would relate to the growing diversity of the population. A third would cite the periodic spats that erupt between cash-strapped governments and Archbishops of Canterbury who preach compassion.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 But at least as compelling an argument for disestablishing the Church of England would be the embarrassment that radiates from a Prime Minister who from time to time feels the urge to wear his religious heart on his sleeve. Or perhaps that should be his \u8220\'20\'1Csort of religious\u8221\'20\'1D heart \u8211\'20\'13 which is not to question anyone\u8217\'20\'19s sincerity, just the lukewarm essence of established Anglicanism. Alastair Campbell was so right to steer Tony Blair away from \u8220\'20\'1Cdoing God\u8221\'20\'1D; here was one scrape at least that he avoided.\par \par \uc2 Not so, his successor but one at No 10. In his Easter article for the Church Times, David Cameron comes across as a thoroughly typical Anglican \u8211\'20\'13 a bit of this, a bit of that, not too demonstrative, not too certain; someone who appreciatively sends his children to CofE schools while apparently wishing that he, and his Church, were more assertive about the whole thing.\par \par \uc2 And he does his best. \u8220\'20\'1CSome people,\u8221\'20\'1D he writes, \u8220\'20\'1Cfeel that in this ever more secular age we shouldn't talk about these things. I completely disagree. I believe we should be more confident about our status as a Christian country, more ambitious about expanding the role of faith-based organisations, and, frankly, more evangelical about a faith that compels us to get out there and make a difference to people's lives.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 After which he hastily goes on to say that greater confidence about Britain as a Christian country does not entail \u8220\'20\'1Cdoing down\u8221\'20\'1D those of others faiths, or none at all. \u8220\'20\'1CMany people tell me it is easier to be Jewish or Muslim in Britain than in a secular country, precisely because the tolerance that Christianity demands of our society provides greater space for other religious faiths, too.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 You can see the difficulty. As Prime Minister of a country with an established church of which he is a member, an increasingly secular outlook and growing non-Christian minorities, Cameron is in tricky territory if he wants to recommend that Britain should be more confident about its Christian identity. I rather wish that he did not feel the need to try, and left it to the Queen to distribute the Maundy money, as she did yesterday in Blackburn (a city with the third-highest proportion of Muslims in the country).\par \par \uc2 It is possible to respect Cameron for putting his religious faith out there, not least in the quite modest and very British way in which he did in the Church Times, while suspecting that purposes other than personal witness and observance of Eastertide might be at work. That is the trouble about being Prime Minister and talking not about faith in the abstract, but about your own.\par \par \uc2 Because even if he did not mean to score any political points, this is how his contribution can be construed. With European elections a little more than a month away and a general election in a year\u8217\'20\'19s time, the spectre of Ukip looms large. While denying that his party is anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as such, Nigel Farage would not dispute that it is about national identity, and that identity for many of its potential voters and wavering Conservatives would encompass a brand of Anglicanism a la Cameron. So it is useful, to put it no more strongly, for the Conservative leader to have this on the record in nice time for Easter.\par \par \uc2 Similarly with compassion. As benefits reform advances, steered unapologetically by Iain Duncan Smith, so those who see its practical \u8211\'20\'13 or political \u8211\'20\'13 downsides mobilise to get their view across. The Christian churches, galvanised by the new Archbishop of Canterbury, have made much of the running, including in an open letter published earlier this week, signed by 42 Anglican bishops and more than 600 others, calling for action to stop people going hungry in the UK.\par \par \uc2 No matter that international figures show both food poverty, and child poverty, in Britain declining, or that the Coalition has an electoral mandate for reducing welfare spending. The perception is that benefit changes are driving thousands to food banks, and it is no good Cameron spouting George Bush-style \u8220\'20\'1Ccompassionate conservatism\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Even as the economic recovery threatens to make its life awkward, Labour can take comfort from the return of the \u8220\'20\'1Cnasty party\u8221\'20\'1D.\u160\'00\'A0 Taken at face value or as politics, Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s profession of faith and benevolence to all this Easter will not be enough to turn the tide. In this, he might done better to emulate Blair, in keeping God and Caesar \u8211\'20\'13 at least for public purposes - apart.\par \par \uc2 Read more: David Cameron acclaims his and Britain\u8217\'20\'19s Christian faithThrow down your \uc2 NHS\uc2  crutch and walk\par \par \uc2 GPs in south Warwickshire have floated the introduction of charges for medical aids, such as crutches, to cut an annual bill approaching half a million pounds. \uc2 NHS\uc2  England and the TUC General Secretary at once rejected the idea, insisting that charging for such items could be illegal and counter to everything the \uc2 NHS\uc2  stands for. Everyone here is wrong.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The GPs should ask how far patients are encouraged to return equipment that is issued at present. My past efforts to return crutches, an orthopaedic \u8220\'20\'1Cboot\u8221\'20\'1D and unused medicines have been met variously with indifference, irritation and outright rejection. Those attitudes need to change.\par \par \uc2 As for medical aids being free on the \uc2 NHS\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 come off it! Many people receive nothing; many others find the procedures so ponderous and what is available so grudgingly offered or so unsuitable that they resort to the market. People are spending enormous amounts of money on everything from walking sticks to wheelchairs to mobility scooters, in a market where, as the Office of Fair Trading recently established, price-fixing and pressure-selling are rife.\par \par \uc2 This is a discussion that needs to be opened up, not closed down by the fiction that at present all medical help is free.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Sorry, Baroness Lawrence, but campaigner is not the same as mayor\par \par \uc2 I felt a bit sorry for Tessa Jowell, when a BBC interviewer surprised her by asking whether the recently ennobled Doreen Lawrence should be Labour\u8217\'20\'19s candidate for mayor of London. Dame Tessa \u8211\'20\'13 who is believed to have mayoral ambitions herself \u8211\'20\'13 had to ask for clarification. As well she might. It is a foolhardy politician, or commentator, for that\u160\'00\'A0 matter, who would question Baroness Lawrence\u8217\'20\'19s suitability for anything \u8211\'20\'13 up to and including canonisation. But mayor of London? I think not.\par \par \uc2 She may be a single-minded and effective campaigner; she may have suffered great injustice; she may embody the still-unfinished struggle for equality. But none of this, by itself, comes close to qualifying her to be mayor. At best, the idea smacks of tokenism; at worst, it invites a backlash. This is a proposal that needs to be scotched before it becomes so mainstream that it is seen as racist to demur.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140417ea4h001p5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 As a survey declares that 63 per cent of men think they don't read enough, this is our list of recent titles \u8211\'20\'13 fiction and non-fiction \u8211\'20\'13 that can get men back to books\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/historybookreviews/10382547/Catastrophe-by-Max-Hastings-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Catastrophe: Europe Goes to War in 1914 by Max Hastings}}}\par \par \uc2 As with his recent books on the Second World War, Hastings adopts a cosmopolitan approach in which Britain takes her proper place as just one among the combatant nations \u8211\'20\'13 and numerically a very small player at that. Ranging across the war\u8217\'20\'19s many theatres, from Russia and Prussia to the Balkans and the Vosges, as well as the more familiar Flanders, Hastings presents individual tragedies alongside the grand strategy in one overarching whole. And, in typically robust style, he gives short shrift both to what he sees as the skewed \u8220\'20\'1Cpoets\u8217\'20\'19 view\u8221\'20\'1D of the war as unmitigated futility, and to pro-German revisionists seeking to clear Berlin of blame for starting the conflict.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10208730/Empire-of-the-Deep-Ben-Wilson-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Empire of the Deep: the Rise and Fall of the British Navy by Ben Wilson}}}\par \par \uc2 This is a large book whose ambition is splendidly realised. Wilson charts and celebrates a 1,000-year love affair between our islands and the seaborne branch of the armed forces. Wilson\u8217\'20\'19s clever digressions into Britain\u8217\'20\'19s linguistic, commercial, artistic and imperial history are wound around an energetic narrative of battles and bravado. The sea boils and timbers creak as you read this smart, salty, invigorating work.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/9810916/The-Pike-by-Lucy-Hughes-Hallett-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 The Pike by Lucy Hughes-Hallett}}}\par \par \uc2 Gabriele D'Annunzio may have been a goggle-eyed gargoyle but was irresistible \u8211\'20\'13 to Italian crowds, as the man who could save their national honour; and to women, who stampeded to lose theirs. As one of his mistresses ruefully remarked: \u8220\'20\'1CIn heaven, dear poet, there will be reserved for you an enormous octopus with a thousand women\u8217\'20\'19s legs (but no head).\u8221\'20\'1D D\u8217\'20\'19Annunzio was a man of letters \u8211\'20\'13 his collected works run to 48 volumes \u8211\'20\'13 and was ranked by Joyce alongside Kipling and Tolstoy; but he was also a frenzied demagogue for whom writing was a martial art \u8220\'20\'1Cto spark uprisings and to set nations ablaze\u8221\'20\'1D. Craving cataclysmic violence, he helped to create the appetite for fascism, plus many of its motifs. This biography is as well written as it is expertly structured.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/christmas-gift-ideas/10473372/Christmas-2013-best-sports-books-of-the-year.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic}}}\par \par \uc2 This is the perfect antidote to the annihilating tedium of post-match interview clich\u233\'00\'E9. In order to assure us he is not going to be fettered by professional etiquette, he takes down Pep Guardiola first. That\u8217\'20\'19s right, Saint Pep, the architect of a Barcelona side that might just be the greatest in history. You have to go a long way in football to hear a bad word spoken about Guardiola. By the end of chapter one Ibrahimovic has told him he is a \u8220\'20\'1Cspineless coward\u8221\'20\'1D who \u8220\'20\'1Cdoesn\u8217\'20\'19t have any balls\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Let\u8217\'20\'19s be clear: Ibrahimovic is preposterous. On page two he describes himself as \u8220\'20\'1Camazing\u8221\'20\'1D. On page three he is \u8220\'20\'1Cawesome\u8221\'20\'1D. On page four he comes over all modest and tones it down to \u8220\'20\'1Cpretty awesome\u8221\'20\'1D. He relays anecdotes in which he talks about himself in the third person. He is utterly convinced of his own divinity. And downright compelling it is too.\par \par \uc2 What prevents this from being a mere exercise in self-aggrandisement is Ibrahimovic\u8217\'20\'19s irrepressible charisma. Behind the bluster there is a story of a child from an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  Bosnian family trying to make it in a world discomfited by his presumption. Time and again he proves people wrong, riding the wave of his phenomenal talent. That\u8217\'20\'19s the thing with Ibrahimovic: he\u8217\'20\'19s pretty much as good as he thinks he is.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10288312/A-Classless-Society-Britaininthe-1990s-by-Alwyn-Turner-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 A Classless Society: Britain in the 1990s by Alwyn Turner}}}\par \par \uc2 Turner begins his story with the fall of Thatcher and concludes in 2001 with the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. He takes a firm grip both on the politics and the cultural developments of his decade, although with chapter titles such as \u8220\'20\'1CLads\u8221\'20\'1D, \u8220\'20\'1CCool\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1CEnter Tony Blair\u8221\'20\'1D, readers may find themselves squirming as they read. Did that really just happen? But Turner\u8217\'20\'19s subject matter is no reflection on his immense gifts as a chronicler and historian \u8211\'20\'13 as a first take on a decade whose wounds remain partially open, this is essential reading.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/fictionreviews/10304078/Bleeding-Edge-by-Thomas-Pynchon-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Bleeding Edge by Thomas Pynchon}}}\par \par \uc2 This was published slap-bang amid the first wave of Prism revelations, which dedicated fans naturally took as the final proof that America\u8217\'20\'19s arch-novelist of paranoia really does know something we don\u8217\'20\'19t. Set in 2001, in the New York dotcom bubble that preceded the 9/11 attacks, this was Pynchon\u8217\'20\'19s best novel since Mason & Dixon, an exhilarating shaggy-dog private-detective story that punctured its own garrulous charm with sharp stabs of betrayal and threat. Astonishing, too, that a 76-year-old should produce a novel with such wild and slangy bounce.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/fictionreviews/10382558/The-Circle-by-Dave-Eggers-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 The Circle by Dave Eggers}}}\par \par \uc2 A a satirical thriller about a large Californian company, crewed by bright-eyed twentysomething idealists, that sets out to make life better by making all the world\u8217\'20\'19s data public to everyone. The Circle is sometimes silly, but its \uc2 Google\uc2 -gone-wrong message has a chilling fascination; and Eggers packages the whole thing with sleek professionalism.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10182586/The-Flamethrowers-by-Rachel-Kushner-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 The Flamethrowers by Rachel Kushner}}}\par \par \uc2 The novel does not waste any time. It begins with an Italian soldier beating a German to death with a motorcycle headlamp during the First World War, then jumps to a young woman hurtling through the Nevada desert on the back of a high-performance motorcycle. It sets you up for what is to come: the seductions of speed and violence. Kushner is asking questions about youthful ardency and its consequences, and in search of answers she criss-crosses the 20th century, from colonial Egypt to the New York art scene of the Seventies, from the rubber plantations of Brazil to the chaos of the \u8220\'20\'1CYears of Lead\u8221\'20\'1D in Italy.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9793434/Tenth-of-December-by-George-Saunders-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Tenth of December by George Saunders}}}\par \par \uc2 The winner of the Folio Prize writes genuinely strange stories. Not in an ostentatious way, but with creeping clarity.

Who really benefits? And the answer is of course Germany.\par \par \uc2 "It is no coincidence that just about every country in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  is getting poorer while Germany continues to get richer and richer.\par \par \uc2 "We may think we won the Second World War. But we lost. It is no surprise that we are all living in the Fourth Reich.\par \par \uc2 "Knowingly or not those who support and defend the \uc2 European Union\uc2  are supporting the Nazi legacy."\par \par \uc2 Under a chapter heading 'The EU was inspired an designed by Nazis', the authors claim: "Hitler was the man who gave bones to the dreams first expressed by Charlemagne and Napoleon but the finishing touches to the EU as we know it were put in place during World War II by a man called Walther Funk, who was President of the Reichsbank and a director of the \uc2 Bank for International Settlements\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "It was Funk who predicted the coming of European economic unity. Funk was also Adolf Hitler's economics minister and his key economics advisor."\par \par \uc2 It continues: "The Nazis wanted to get rid of the clutter of small nations which made up Europe and their plan was quite simple. The EU was Hitler's dream."\par \par \uc2 The book argues it is no coincidence that the EU is so close to Hitler's plan for post-war Europe.\par \par \uc2 According to the authors: "In 1945, Hitler's Masterplan was captured by the Allies. The Plan included details of his scheme to create an economic integration of Europe and to found a \uc2 European Union\uc2  on a federal basis.\par \par \uc2 "The Nazi plan for a federal Europe was based on Lenin's belief that 'federation is a transitional form towards complete union of all nations'.\par \par \uc2 "It is impossible to find a difference between Hitler's plan for a new United States of Europe, dominated by Germany, and the \uc2 European Union\uc2  we have today."\par \par \uc2 Hitler's Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels would have been proud of the BBC, the books says [GETTY]\par \par \uc2 The book also claims Conservative Prime Minister Ted Heath - "a self-confessed liar and a traitor" - was paid \u163\'00\'A335,000 to take Britain into the European Economic Community in 1973 and Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels would be proud of the BBC's support of the EU.\par \par \uc2 The final part of the book lists "73 things you ought to know about the EU ".\par \par \uc2 In amongst concerns about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and the Common Agricultural Policy, the authors argue "The EU is making DIY illegal", "EU law forces pig owners to apply for walking licences" and "The EU wants to control the music you listen to".\par \par \uc2 It also claims: "The EU has forced us to use light bulbs which are more dangerous and more expensive than the old ones.\par \par \uc2 "The first problem with the new EU light-bulbs is that the light produced by them is so poor that people have difficulty seeing where they are going - let alone being able to see well enough to read or work."\par \par \uc2 Edward Heath in 1974 [GETTY]\par \par \uc2 According to the book, European Commission vice-president Viviane Reding crystallised "Hitler's dream, Hitler's words" earlier this year when she "called for a 'true political union' and a campaign for the \uc2 European Union\uc2  to become a 'United States of Europe'."\par \par \uc2 A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: \u8220\'20\'1CPeople have been peddling outlandish myths about the EU for decades and this book is an example of that. Some of the suggestions made are completely ludicrous. Winston Churchill called for a \u8220\'20\'1CUnited States of Europe\u8221\'20\'1D and I doubt the author would call him a Nazi.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Liberal Democrats want Britain to stay in the EU because we are fighting for a stronger economy \u8211\'20\'13 fighting to defend millions of British jobs which are linked to our trade with the EU.\par \par \uc2 "Being in Europe gives us more strength when negotiating trade deals with global players on the world stage.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 It is not the first time the EU has been described as a German plot to take over Europe.\par \par \uc2 In 1990, Cabinet Minister Nicholas Ridley - a close ally of Margaret Thatcher - was forced to resign after he described proposed Economic and Monetary Union as "a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe" and said that giving up sovereignty to the \uc2 European Union\uc2  was as bad as giving it up to Hitler.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140417ea4h002p9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features; Opinion, Column\par \b \uc2 A media storm won't cleanse British sexism\b0\par\par\uc2 Rosamund Urwin   \par \uc2 516 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 April 2014\par \uc2 London Evening Standard\par \uc2 NS\par \uc2 1; National\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited   \par \par \uc2 IN A game of sexist top trumps, would Britain emerge victorious? Would we see off every other nation, beating Yemen with its lone female MP, India with its record on rape or Saudi Arabia where law-makers think women are such delicate flowers that they couldn't possibly get behind a wheel? No, of course we wouldn't. So we can all just ignore the meddling, mad woman from the United Nations who claimed that the UK was the most sexist country in the world, right? Except that she didn't actually say that. Professor Rashida Manjoo, the UN's special rapporteur who is currently jetting around the world to research violence against women, simply said that sexism is more overt in the UK. She was comparing Britain with a small pool of countries she has visited on this trip, which admittedly include Bangladesh and Somalia. Her comment referred to the media portrayal of the sexes and the marketisation of women's bodies.\par \par \uc2 "Have I seen this level of sexist culture in other countries?" Manjoo asked. "It hasn't been so in your face... I'm sure it exists but it wasn't so much and so pervasive."\par \par \uc2 Arguing that sexist culture is more out-in-the-open is not the same as saying it is at its most severe. Sexism has a multitude of different manifestations, many of which are much more covert than up-skirt shots in newspapers or the Sun's Page 3. Those are overt by intention: a topless 21-year-old is half there to sell papers to men, half to annoy feminists like me.\par \par \uc2 What was telling, though, were the screeching denials from (mostly male) commentators about Manjoo's misconstrued statement. "How dare she generalise and accuse ALL Brits of abusing women!" was a typically hyperbolic response. The British boys' club that she had spoken of closed ranks. So instead of engaging in a discussion about the position of women in Britain today, these men simply listed the countries that were worse. Not being Yemen doesn't make Britain an equal opportunities Elysium.\par \par \uc2 This confected media storm distracted from all the issues Manjoo was raising. Her report set out the extent of violence against women in Britain, the way austerity measures are affecting services for victims of domestic abuse, and the way legal aid cuts are disproportionately hitting women from ethnic minorities. Clearly, these don't make such good headlines. Worst of all, it emerged Manjoo had been denied access to the \uc2 Serco\uc2 -run Yarl's Wood \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  detention centre \u8212\'20\'14 despite repeated requests. Given that a 40-year-old woman died of a heart attack there last month, it needed a visit.\par \par \uc2 The rest of the world may not need the UK to teach Misogyny: 101 seminars \u8212\'20\'14 other countries are good enough at it themselves. But nor is Britain the best of all possible worlds for women.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @RosamundUrwin\par \par \uc2 Sexism has a multitude of manifestations.

Blair was only 43 when he came to power.\par \par \uc2 CV The Streatham MP is seen as a shoo-in for party leadership.

In May last year Gove told the Education Select Committee: \u8216\'20\'18If you\u8217\'20\'19re saying I\u8217\'20\'19m the heir to Blair... I plead guilty.\u8217\'20\'19 The Mail has claimed that Blair and Gove had covert meetings, in which Blair urged Gove to have confidence in his policies and declared his support for free schools and academies.\par \par \uc2 CV The MP for Surrey has been Education Secretary since 2010.\par \par \uc2 He says: \u8216\'20\'18Tony Blair will decide who his heir is but I am a great fan.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Who knew?

\par\par \uc2 Comment\par \b \uc2 Rosamund Urwin: A media storm won\u8217\'20\'19t cleanse British sexism\b0\par\par\uc2 1,013 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 April 2014\par 13:41\par \uc2 London Evening Standard Online\par \uc2 NSONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited.   \par \par \uc2 Sexism has a multitude of manifestations.\u160\'00\'A0 Not being Yemen doesn\u8217\'20\'19t make Britain an equal opportunities Elysium\par \par \uc2 In a game of sexist top trumps, would Britain emerge victorious? Would we see off every other nation, beating Yemen with its lone female MP, India with its record on rape or Saudi Arabia where law-makers think women are such delicate flowers that they couldn\u8217\'20\'19t possibly get behind a wheel? No, of course we wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t. So we can all just ignore the meddling, mad woman from the United Nations who claimed that the UK was the most sexist country in the world, right?\par \par \uc2 Except that she didn\u8217\'20\'19t actually say that. Professor Rashida Manjoo, the UN\u8217\'20\'19s special rapporteur who is currently jetting around the world to research violence against women, simply said that sexism is more overt in the UK. She was comparing Britain with a small pool of countries she has visited on this trip, which admittedly include Bangladesh and Somalia. Her comment referred to the media portrayal of the sexes and the marketisation of women\u8217\'20\'19s bodies.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHave I seen this level of sexist culture in other countries?\u8221\'20\'1D Manjoo asked. \u8220\'20\'1CIt hasn\u8217\'20\'19t been so in your face... I\u8217\'20\'19m sure it exists but it wasn\u8217\'20\'19t so much and so pervasive.\u8221\'20\'1D Arguing that sexist culture is more out-in-the-open is not the same as saying it is at its most severe. Sexism has a multitude of different manifestations, many of which are much more covert than up-skirt shots in newspapers or the Sun\u8217\'20\'19s Page 3. Those are overt by intention: a topless 21-year-old is half there to sell papers to men, half to annoy feminists like me.\par \par \uc2 What was telling, though, were the screeching denials from (mostly male) commentators about Manjoo\u8217\'20\'19s misconstrued statement. \u8220\'20\'1CHow dare she generalise and accuse ALL Brits of abusing women!\u8221\'20\'1D was a typically hyperbolic response. The British boys\u8217\'20\'19 club that she had spoken of closed ranks. So instead of engaging in a discussion about the position of women in Britain today, these men simply listed the countries that were worse. Not being Yemen doesn\u8217\'20\'19t make Britain an equal opportunities Elysium.\par \par \uc2 This confected media storm distracted from all the issues Manjoo was raising. Her report set out the extent of violence against women in Britain, the way austerity measures are affecting services for victims of domestic abuse, and the way legal aid cuts are disproportionately hitting women from ethnic minorities. Clearly, these don\u8217\'20\'19t make such good headlines. Worst of all, it emerged Manjoo had been denied access to the \uc2 Serco\uc2 -run Yarl\u8217\'20\'19s Wood \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  detention centre \u8212\'20\'14 despite repeated requests. Given that a 40-year-old woman died of a heart attack there last month, it needed a visit.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The rest of the world may not need the UK to teach Misogyny: 101 seminars \u8212\'20\'14other countries are good enough at it themselves. But nor is Britain the best of all possible worlds for women.\par \par \uc2 How I\u8217\'20\'19d make the weather\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, the final trailer for the next X-Men film \u8212\'20\'14 the confusingly named Days of Future Past \u8212\'20\'14 was released. This is supposed to be the mothership, the film that will make up for two Wolverine movies. It certainly looks good. Explosions! Evil robots! Jennifer Lawrence kicking a man in the face!\par \par \uc2 It also seems terribly angsty.\par \par \uc2 I know that X-Men is really a civil rights parable, but why do so few characters, on getting their powers, think, \u8220\'20\'1CThis is the most awesome thing that could happen to me \u8212\'20\'14 my party trick is sorted for life\u8221\'20\'1D?\par \par \uc2 I have spent many hours working out which power is best: Storm\u8217\'20\'19s ability to control the weather. You can become invisible by casting a fog around you, fly thanks to the wind and zap people with lightning. But best of all, you could put a little rain cloud above the head of anyone irritating you and make it follow them around all day.\par \par \uc2 The S&M side of London property porn\par \par \uc2 There's a game you can play on Rightmove. The aim is to stumble upon the worst property on sale there \u8212\'20\'14 the kind that even Kirstie Allsopp couldn\u8217\'20\'19t find a kind word for \u8212\'20\'14 and see how estate agents have talked it up. \u8220\'20\'1CEveryone will be well jel of your SW4 postcode!\u8221\'20\'1D one wrote of a dingy studio flat (asking price: \u163\'00\'A3110,000). \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s all the essentials ticked off,\u8221\'20\'1D another said of a 10ft by 11ft hovel where the kitchen was just a sink (\u163\'00\'A385,000). Both presumably came with a bruised cat in the corner who\u8217\'20\'19d been unsuccessfully swung.\par \par \uc2 They are emblematic of the madness of the London housing market. But searching for them, I fear, is property poverty porn. It\u8217\'20\'19s the opposite of salivating over the kind of home that makes 24-year-old blondes fall in love with septuagenarian billionaires \u8212\'20\'14 this is revelling in relief that your home isn\u8217\'20\'19t quite that pokey. It\u8217\'20\'19s also a masochistic exercise, a reminder of how little our money can buy. If this is Fifty Shades of Grey with houses, we\u8217\'20\'19re definitely Ana, and Foxtons is whip-wielding Christian Grey.\par \par \uc2 The worst thing of all, of course, is that some poor soul will end up living there.\par \par \uc2 Print still has pulling power\par \par \uc2 After the Women Who Eat on Tubes furore, I bring you the much lovelier Man Making Puppet on Train. Richard Hay was photographed on Tuesday constructing a model of a mini man out of a copy of the Evening Standard and the picture went viral. Hay, an actor and puppet director, was catching up on work on the way to a rehearsal for The Hole in the Night, which will be performed at Enfield\u8217\'20\'19s Dugdale Centre on May 25.\par \par \uc2 It wasn\u8217\'20\'19t just an accidental ad for his craft, though: it showed the enduring power of print. You can\u8217\'20\'19t build a puppet out of an iPad.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @RosamundUrwin\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140417ea4h001jn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

We have allocated a total of 3,166 school places to Salford residents, 92 per cent of families have been offered their first or second choices.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Tameside had the biggest year-on-year increase in the number of children who were not offered the first choice \u8211\'20\'13 13pc missing out this year compared to 10pc in 2013.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Tameside council\uc2  spokesman said: \u8220\'20\'1CTameside\u8217\'20\'19s figures were affected by a seven per cent increase in applications \u8211\'20\'13 more than in any other Greater Manchester borough. Even so, we believe we have done very well. More parents got their first-choice school this year as opposed to 2013: 2,568 to 2,460.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTo accommodate the increased demand for places we have successfully acquired government funding to build two new primary schools \u8211\'20\'13 in Ashton and Hyde \u8211\'20\'13 and we are expanding other sites.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Tameside also saw the greatest increase in demand for places \u8211\'20\'13 up 7pc from 2,745 applications last year to 2,950 in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Applications across Greater Manchester, excluding Stockport and Trafford, who did not provide us with figures, were up two per cent on average compared to last year \u8211\'20\'13 from 27,995 to 28,629.\par \par \uc2 Across the region, between 94pc and 97pc of families were offered preferences one to three \u8211\'20\'13 leaving hundreds of families with a fourth of fifth choice.\par \par \uc2 In Manchester alone, more than 300 children were offered a school that their parents had not listed in their preferences.\par \par \uc2 As part of National Offer Day, parents across the country found out about their choices at the same time instead of individual local authorities giving decisions in their own time.\par \par \uc2 Some 600,000 families across the country found out about their places today (note WED) and early indications suggest that one in seven children - or 13pc - were unable to get their first choice place. Schools have been facing an increasing squeeze on places in recent years, caused partly by a rising birth rate and the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the \uc2 Association of Teachers and Lecturers\uc2  (ATL), accused Education Secretary Michael Gove of failing to provide school places for the nation\u8217\'20\'19s children.She said: \u8220\'20\'1CWe know that there is a growing crisis in primary school places and we know that the Government, for all the money they say they are throwing at the problem, haven\u8217\'20\'19t got the ability to plan school provision where it\u8217\'20\'19s needed.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Department for Education (DfE) said it has given councils more than \u163\'00\'A35bn to establish new school places, with 260,000 created already.\par \par \uc2 Document MNONL00020140417ea4h00105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 One singer, one pianist: stripped-back interludes may be a staple of arena rock gigs, proving the authenticity of mainstream acts, but for true intimacy you will struggle to beat Guy Garvey and keyboardist Craig Potter.\par \par \uc2 Apart from that pair, you can hear a pin drop during their haunting first verse of 'The Blanket Of Night', a plea for empathy with asylum seekers, before the rest of Elbow join in.\par \par \uc2 The Mancunian five-piece may have achieved national-treasure status by penning wedding staple 'One Day Like This', leading them to score the BBC's 2012 Olympic theme, yet this long-suffering group still revel in understatement.\par \par \uc2 This is especially the case on current album The Take Off And Landing Of Everything, where thankfully they refuse to try striking anthemic gold once more in the manner that made 2011's Build A Rocket Boys! a slight misstep. And despite its more minimal direction, as evinced on that pro-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  number, last month's follow-up has become Elbow's first number one album at the sixth time of asking.\par \par \uc2 Rather than throwing open curtains to greet the sunshine, Garvey is pondering middle-age, losing friends and breaking up, though the latter's impact is difficult to judge given the respected BBC6 broadcaster was bruised and worldly wise when his band first emerged in the early noughties. The bearded, bear-like singer pads from stage to runway and even if the latter is low enough for him to press the flesh, he remains a commanding figure. His constant cajoling for arm-waving and clapping feels like compensation for the delicacy provided by the new material that packs their set.\par \par \uc2 Elbow are still capable of grand gestures, progressing in short order from piano notes tinkling over moody electro pulses and involving percussion to Floydian arrangements both loud and intricate, aided by the judicious involvement of a seven-strong brass and strings section.\par \par \uc2 The trumpets add a plaintive salute to the elegiac 'My Sad Captains', a highlight from Take Off..., and an alarming no-wave punch to 'Fly Boy Blue'. Mid-set, the end of Garvey's ramp becomes a mini-stage for stripped-back readings of 'Great Expectations' and part of 'The Blanket...'.\par \par \uc2 Potter's upright piano used for this pair of ballads suggests bringing the feel of a saloon bar into the arena, an effect achieved elsewhere through Garvey's easy familiarity and rapport with his audience. \u8220\'20\'1CWe lost a friend last week,\u8221\'20\'1D he says by way of introduction and dedication to 'The Night Will Always Win', beginning a ramble that ends sweetly with a toast to absent friends. Later, the frontman instigates an astonishing piece of audience participation he terms a reverse Mexican wave.\par \par \uc2 Thus, Elbow's two-hour set swings from the melancholy trip-hop influences of 'Charge' to the crunching grunge of 'Grounds For Divorce' (with a cameo from Garvey on his own drum kit), via the gliding strings of 'The Birds'. So many exquisite details require constant concentration and the fans get their due reward.

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The 29-year-old Jamaican was given a life sentence aged 16 for stabbing another schoolboy, but cannot be deported because he claims he is gay and will be subject to degrading treatment\par \par \uc2 An illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  who stabbed a 15-year-old boy to death less than a year after arriving in Britain cannot be deported because he claims to be gay, a court has ruled.\par \par \uc2 The 29-year-old Jamaican was given a life sentence aged 16 when he and another schoolboy killed Abdul Maye following an argument over a \u163\'00\'A310 debt outside his school in east London.\par \par \uc2 A judge at the Old Bailey ordered he be deported once he had served a minimum of eight years.\par \par \uc2 Judge Paul Focke told the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons: "You are a Jamaican national and within months of coming to this country you committed murder.\par \par \uc2 "I am of the view that your continued presence in this country will be detrimental to its citizens."\par \par \uc2 But yesterday the Court of Appeal ruled that he could not return to Jamaica because he risked degrading treatment for being homosexual that would breach his human rights, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2606128/Illegal-immigrant-murdered-British-teenager-deport-GAY-kept-quiet-packed-off.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Daily Mail}}}\uc2  reported.\par \par \uc2 Lord Justice Kay cited Article Three in the Human Rights Act, which protects against inhuman or degrading treatment.\par \par \uc2 Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: "Most people would think this is outrageous. It\u8217\'20\'19s a gross distortion of the concept of justice.\par \par \uc2 Until we have freed ourselves from the European Convention on Human Rights, these sorts of basket-case decisions will carry on happening thick and fast."\par \par \uc2 The murderer stabbed his victim, who fled to Britain from the civil war in Somalia in 1995, less than 12 months after arriving in the UK in December 2000 on a temporary visa to visit his mother.\par \par \uc2 He and another 14-year-old boy were jailed for life in September 2002 and told to serve a minimum of eight years and two months. But this was reduced on appeal to six years and two months.\par \par \uc2 In 2009, the Secretary of State ordered his deportation but after one failed appeal, the Jamaican launched a second appeal in April 1012, arguing for the first time that he was gay.\par \par \uc2 The Jamaican successfully appealed Mrs May's decision another two times before Lord Justice Kay yesterday said he believed the evidence of the man's mother, who said that she "knew all along" that her son was gay.\par \par \uc2 At the Court of Appeal, Catherine Rowlands, for Mrs May, argued that 'the claim of homosexuality was contrived and brought as a last resort to avoid deportation.\par \par \uc2 Mrs May accepted that, if he was genuinely gay, the man could not be deported.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140417ea4h001mh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw138\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2070\pichgoal600

Whatever you think of the rest of his policies, those, to me, seem to be two quite big catastrophes for our nation's children and young people.' Studies suggest many councils have received more applications for primary school places compared with last year.\par \par \uc2 In Rutland, Doncaster and north-east Lincolnshire almost all parents got their first choice of primary school.\par \par \uc2 But two fifths missed out in Kensington and Chelsea.\par \par \uc2 The Department for Education said it had given councils more than \u163\'00\'A35billion to establish new school places, with more than 260,000 created already.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, almost half of parents admit sending their child to a specific nursery in the hope of winning a primary school place.\par \par \uc2 'Competition for what parents perceive to be the best schools is now so tough they will do almost anything to gain their child a place,' said \uc2 Siobhan Freegard\uc2 , founder of Netmums, which carried out a poll of 1,000 parents.\par \par \uc2 Document METRO00020140417ea4h00027\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw137\pich34\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2055\pichgoal510

According to figures provided by eight of Greater Manchester's town halls, more than 3,000 children, out of almost 29,000 applications, missed out on their parents' first choice - an average of 11pc.\par \par \uc2 Salford had the highest percentage of mums and dads who failed to get their preferred school - with 14pc - although, unlike other town halls, their figures contained late applications.\par \par \uc2 Coun John Merry, assistant mayor for children's services for Salford, said: "We are proud to have allocated a school place to every application that was received up to yesterday, including late applicants.\par \par \uc2 "This is not the situation in every local authority. We have allocated a total of 3,166 school places to Salford residents, 92 per cent of families have been offered their first or second choices."\par \par \uc2 Tameside had the biggest year-on-year increase in the number of children who were not offered the first choice - 13pc missing out this year compared to 10pc in 2013.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Tameside said 'our people say they would be very surprised if we have the worst record' but failed to provide further comment. Tameside also saw the greatest increase in demand for places - up 7pc from 2,745 applications last year to 2,950 in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Applications across Greater Manchester, excluding Stockport and Trafford, who did not provide us with figures, were up two per cent on average compared to last year - from 27,995 to 28,629.\par \par \uc2 Across the region, between 94pc and 97pc of families were offered preferences one to three - leaving hundreds of families with a fourth of fifth choice.\par \par \uc2 In Manchester alone, more than 300 children were offered a school that their parents had not listed in their preferences.\par \par \uc2 As part of National Offer Day, parents across the country found out about their choices at the same time instead of individual local authorities giving decisions in their own time.\par \par \uc2 Some 600,000 families across the country found out about their places yesterday and early indications suggest that one in seven children - or 13pc - were unable to get their first choice place.\par \par \uc2 Schools have been facing an increasing squeeze on places in recent years, caused partly by a rising birth rate and the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the \uc2 Association of Teachers and Lecturers\uc2 , accused Education Secretary Michael Gove of failing to provide school places for the nation's children.\par \par \uc2 She said: "We know that there is a growing crisis in primary school places and we know that the Government, for all the money they say they are throwing at the problem, haven't got the ability to plan school provision where it's needed."\par \par \uc2 The Department for Education said it has given councils more than \u163\'00\'A35bn to establish new school places, with 260,000 created already.\par \par \uc2 'It's our fifth choice and it's 40 minutes away' A MUM working two jobs while studying at university has been left 'upset and disappointed' after her son got in her fifth choice school - which is a 40-minute walk away.\par \par \uc2 Kayleigh Norcross, who looks after four-year-old Harry on her own, had put a school around the corner from her home in Pendleton, Salford, as her first preference and one near Salford University as her second - to make it easier to drop her little boy off because she does not drive.\par \par \uc2 The 22-year-old said that she spent time researching her first choices on \uc2 Ofsted\uc2  too - and was happy they would provide the best start for her little boy.\par \par \uc2 Kayleigh, who works as a teaching assistant and a staff trainer at \uc2 McDonald's\uc2 , told the M.E.N. she put down her fifth choice, the Friars Primary School, off Blackfriars Road, to make up the numbers on her preference list.\par \par \uc2 So she was shocked to have been offered that school - not least because it is around a 1.5 mile walk away.\par \par \uc2 Kayleigh, who moved to Salford to study psychology two years ago, said: "I'm just really upset and disappointed that I couldn't provide Harry with the chance of the most beneficial education he could get.\par \par \uc2 "I've read the Friars Primary \uc2 Ofsted\uc2  today and its report is good, but not excellent. And it's a 40-minute walk away."\par \par \uc2 Kayleigh said her first choice was St Sebastian's RC Primary School, on Douglas Green, near her home on Cromwell Road.\par \par \uc2 She said: "I think parents should be given more information about which schools are likely to over-subscribed to avoid disappointment."\par \par \uc2 Kayleigh, who applied for the places on time, said she was considering appealing against the outcome.\par \par \uc2 Coun John Merry, at Salford council, said: "All parents are given information about how the admissions process works, clearly explaining that their home address is used as one of the criteria to help find a place at a school nearest to them. More popular schools are over-subscribed, which is why parents are invited to make up to six choices of schools."\par \par \uc2 'We know that there is a growing crisis in primary school places'\par \par \uc2 Document MN00000020140417ea4h0003j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw59\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal885\pichgoal600

It should not be seen as providing more general succour to others convicted of grave crimes."\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140416ea4g002e9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

\par\par \uc2 Editorial; Opinion Columns\par \b \uc2 Farage and Salmond want you to live in Outopia\b0\par\par\uc2 David Aaronovitch   \par \uc2 1,152 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 April 2014\par \uc2 The Times\par \uc2 T\par \uc2 1; Scotland\par 29\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The Ukip and SNP leaders come from different political traditions but they share more than they'll ever admit\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  and Nigel Farage look at each other, what do they see? Opposites? That's certainly what their supporters claim. Mr Farage's anti\u173\'00\'ADEuropeanism is decried as right\u173\'00\'ADwing by the supporters of Scottish independence. Mr Farage, for his part, sees the Yes campaigners as vandals wanting to break up a valuable union.\par \par \uc2 Farage is shorthand here for those in the UK, including around a third of Tories. who want separation from the EU \u8212\'20\'14 or Brexit as it's known. Salmond is a figurehead for those in Scotland who want separation from the UK \u8212\'20\'14 or Sexit as it isn't known, but should be. And for those who want neither, it is increasingly hard not to see the similarities.\par \par \uc2 The kernel of both groups' arguments consists of the same materials. Their favoured polity \u8212\'20\'14 Scotland or the UK \u8212\'20\'14 has been diminished by its association with, or absorption into, a larger grouping. Despite devolution or the appearance of national government, it is really "Westminster" or "Brussels" \u8212\'20\'14 the Sodom and Gomorrah of governance \u8212\'20\'14 that rule, and rule badly. Either dilutes the capacity of the smaller body to rule itself properly. The people of Scotland didn't vote for David Cameron. The people of the UK didn't vote for Jos\u233\'00\'E9 Manuel Barroso.\par \par \uc2 Looking at the UK and Scottish separatists' arguments it seems almost absurd that, with very few exceptions, they don't wholeheartedly support each other. Which Salmondian precept on independence does a Faragist really disagree with? How, if you think Westminster (whose MPs you directly helped to elect) is a distant and alien place, can you wish to be "ruled" from Brussels? To illustrate this point even further, the imagined alternatives to the UK or Europe also turn out to be the same and for pretty much the same reasons. The SNP/Scottish manifesto, Scotland's Future, apparently mentioned Norway 57 times. "Small independent nations of comparable size to Scotland are the world's happiest", claimed the Yes Scotland website, citing one of those dubious compendium reports from \uc2 Unesco\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Switzerland too, is a better model. Or, as one separatist\u173\'00\'ADminded writer put it recently, "compared with the Brits, the Swiss have far more Jobs, better schools, live longer, earn a lot more money, pay lower taxes and are much less in debt", and crime is much lower.\par \par \uc2 You may or may not have guessed that the latter was actually praising Switzerland as a model non\u173\'00\'ADEU country. But the psychology of the argument is a pretty exact match. Smaller is better: if we could Just separate from them and assume full control, we too could be good and bonny and blithe and gay.\par \par \uc2 The idea of the separate neo\u173\'00\'ADparadise \u8212\'20\'14 you could call it Outopia \u8212\'20\'14 has a particular appeal for those whose other Gods have failed. Last week two former Scottish Labour councillors endorsed independence. One, Gordon McKenzie, was quoted as saying: "We will become a more socialist country if people vote yes."\par \par \uc2 I have heard other Left nationalists argue that not only will Scotland become a more social\u173\'00\'ADdemocratic place (as all Scandinavian nations are imagined to be), but that it will then act as a "beacon" for the rest of the UK to follow suit. This notion that if you subtract a large number of social democratic voters from the UK then the UK will become more social democratic, follows a logic that I would not recommend living one's life by.\par \par \uc2 If both Brexiteers and Sexiteers are enJoying a similarly attractive dream of separation, they also share the same real\u173\'00\'ADlife problem. The debate about whether iScotland and RUK (the rest of the UK) will share a common currency illustrates what this is. To have a common currency with a nation ten times your size means having to play very Junior partner when it comes to decisions being made by the Bank of England. So the independence would be substantially illusory. In fact I don't think RUK would enter such a union, so a different problem would arise.\par \par \uc2 But how about this little potential drama? One of the reasons some iScots give for wanting to leave is English anti\u173\'00\'ADEuropeanism. So, suppose there is indeed an EU referendum in RUK in 2017, one year after Sexit? And suppose that the Sexit fears are realised and the vote is to leave the EU? Where on God's good earth does that leave Scotland? Scots, having had no influence on the vote, would then either be looking at trade tariffs on the movement of Scottish and RUK goods plus customs houses on the border, or else Scotland would have to stay out of the EU too.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime precisely the same logic would apply to a UK (with or without Scotland) that was exiting the EU. We would \uc2 seek\uc2  to get the most advantageous trade terms we could and \u8212\'20\'14 though they wouldn't quite be good enough \u8212\'20\'14 we would pay a price for them in terms of the conditions and regulations attached. Norway does. Switzerland, in a different manner, does. But, like the absent Scots at the 2017 referendum, we would be absent from the decision\u173\'00\'ADmaking in the EU and, contrary to the claims of the Brexiteers, that influence is substantial.\par \par \uc2 It is not surprising, then, that a common language of complacent and ill\u173\'00\'ADfounded reassurance is used by separatists of both camps. It will be all right. They're Just bluffing. Scotland/Britain is too important to the UK/Europe for them not to allow us to separate on our terms. Of course we'll get the division of the assets/the trade terms we want. It's even more in their interest than it is in ours! Nae/no problem!\par \par \uc2 So it isn't surprising either that those whose businesses are immediately and directly affected by the possibility of separation tend to a less rosy view. In the City those who have been following the development of the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  and post\u173\'00\'ADcrash financial regulation seem in little doubt that "in" is where the UK needs to be.. The same is broadly true in Scotland. The closer one is to having to plan for a future involving your own or your client's money, the less attractive any kind of exit becomes.\par \par \uc2 There are differences. I accept that \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  likes \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and Nigel Farage is less keen. That one extols whisky while the other praises beer. But to those of us who don't believe in Outopia, they are hard little peas from the same inedible pod.\par \par \uc2 Nationalists and Ukippers both love Norway and the Swiss\par \par \uc2 Businesses don't like the idea of leaving the the UK or the EU\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140417ea4h000f5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

Since his release Theresa May, the home secretary, has tried to have him repatriated.\par \par \uc2 JR successfully appealed against the home secretary's decision to deport him to the First-Tier Tribunal (FTT), and the Upper Tribunal refused a challenge to that decision brought by Mrs May last year.\par \par \uc2 Now Lord Justice Kay, sitting with Lord Justice Lewison and Sir Stanley Burnton at the Court of Appeal in London, has blocked the government's final attempt to have JR deported. The FTT accepted he was gay and that he would be at risk of "inhuman or degrading treatment" if sent home.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140417ea4h000bo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 UK 'loses control' of \uc2 immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 Edward Fennell   \par \uc2 902 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 April 2014\par \uc2 The Times\par \uc2 T\par \uc2 1; National\par 61\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Overcomplicated rules are keeping out the very migrants the UK needs to attract, writes Edward Fennell\par \par \uc2 What a difference half a century makes. In 1964, when the Sixties started swinging, the net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  figure for the UK was "minus 50,000" as the Commonwealth \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  Act of 1962 started to restrict numbers of entrants.\par \par \uc2 Now, net migration for 2013 is put at "plus 212,000" \u8212\'20\'14 and that is despite the closing of what was called the post-study work route of Tier 1 of the Points Based System for entrants. Indeed, a figure of around plus 200,000 seems to have become the norm. No wonder then that, as Chris Magrath of the specialist \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  firm Magrath LLP points out, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is now the most potent of election issues. Moreover, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  lawyers are mostly of like mind \u8212\'20\'14 the UK's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system is "a big mess".\par \par \uc2 The fact that hard-nosed professionals \u8212\'20\'14 not sensational pundits or ideological politicians \u8212\'20\'14 collectively agree on this is highly significant.\par \par \uc2 "The reality is that we have no control over the number of EU nationals who come into the country," Mr Magrath says. "Meanwhile the government has "painted itself into a corner" by committing itself to a target \u8212\'20\'14 reducing net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to mere tens of thousands \u8212\'20\'14 over which it has virtually no influence."\par \par \uc2 Andrew Osborne, of \uc2 Lewis Silkin\uc2 , agrees, pointing out that "a little bit of honesty from politicians about this would be a big step in the right direction".\par \par \uc2 Instead, says one well-placed lawyer, who prefers not to be named, there is now a political imperative to create the illusion that the government is "getting a grip" on the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  figures through a fevered focus of legal activity on non-EU nationals as the only group who can be managed. "Policy is being driven by the matter of perception so that the government can claim it is clamping down even though in real terms the impact on numbers is absolutely marginal," the lawyer says.\par \par \uc2 As a result, UK \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  law is now "horrendously complicated, with rules being made just for their own sake", Sophie Barrett Brown, of Laura Devine Solicitors, says. "There were a dozen major changes to the rules last year, often hastily drafted and trickling through in dribs and drabs. And there are updates issued virtually every day."\par \par \uc2 As Mr Osborne points out, many of the rules are drawn up on a crude one-size-fits-all basis, which cannot do justice to individual circumstances. A classic example is the requirement that those highly skilled foreign workers who enter the country under intracompany transfers as long-term staff are only permitted to remain for five years. Consequently, the worker returns home but is then replaced by another person brought in to do the same role. "The net result in the number of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  is no change," Ms Barrett Brown says, "but the inconvenience and disruption to the company and the individuals is considerable. These are the kind of negative messages sent out to the rest of the world and interpreted as meaning that the UK is no longer open for business."\par \par \uc2 The paradox is that most of the rules are making it as difficult as possible for the very people that the UK needs to attract \u8212\'20\'14 entrepreneurs and investors. It is also why the demand for the services of top \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  lawyers is so high. "\b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  lawyers are probably doing better than they should," Mr Magrath admits ,"but that's because the rules are disproportionately complicated for what the government is trying to achieve."\par \par \uc2 Tom Ketteley, of Bates Wells Braithwaite, says an example of this is the way that people in the Tier 1 (Investor) category must present the evidence confirming that their \u163\'00\'A31m investment (the minimum requirement) is "freely transferable" to the UK.\par \par \uc2 "Unfortunately the Home Office is prescriptive in only accepting specified documentation," Mr Ketteley says. "To the potential investor it appears that the Home Office doesn't really understand how globally mobile investors operate or what their advisors can and cannot confirm about their affairs."\par \par \uc2 The upshot of this and similar complex regulations is that desirable \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are choosing to go elsewhere, where the rules are less complicated, procedural costs lower and compliance obligations not as demanding.\par \par \uc2 Matters will worsen if the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Bill 2013 gains Royal Assent in its present form. Mandatory checks by landlords and letting agents on the right to residence of their tenants is likely to be costly and complicated, says Tijen Ahmet, the head of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at SA Law.\par \par \uc2 Bilal Rawat, of 7 Bedford Row, says the proposed reforms to the right of appeal, which reduce the current 14 \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  decisions (carrying rights of appeal to the First-Tier Tribunal), down to a mere three, are likely to lead indirectly to an increase in judicial review. "This will mean more work for the higher tribunals and courts and a process that takes longer," he says.\par \par \uc2 So, how to meet the net migration figures? Lose Scotland.

All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SEXISM UK: SUN COLUMNIST HITS BACK\par \par \uc2 UNITED Nations "expert" Rashida Manjoo caused a storm with claims the UK is one of the most sexist countries she has visited.\par \par \uc2 Bizarrely, she put us behind the likes of Algeria, India and Azerbaijan \u8212\'20\'14 countries that are hardly known for their progressive treatment of women.\par \par \uc2 Here outspoken Sun columnist Louise Mensch hits back.\par \par \uc2 UN Special "Rapporteur" Rashida Manjoo says the UK is the most sexist place she has ever been to.\par \par \uc2 And with that joke of a pronouncement she has managed to hammer the last nail into the coffin of UN credibility.\par \par \uc2 So Britain is the biggest boys' club Rashida's ever seen? That's pretty amazing, since she's previously reported from rape capital of the universe, India, where girls are burned alive for having too small a dowry.\par \par \uc2 Where women are routinely gangraped and where a politician recently suggested the victims "should be hung" but the rapists let off because "boys will be boys".\par \par \uc2 Or how about the other countries she visited on this trip. Somalia, where a 13-year-old girl who had been raped begged for mercy as Islamists stoned her to death? Croatia, where even the EU says the number of women working and going to college is "significantly below the EU average"? Italy, where Berlusconi's bungabunga parties symbolise how the elite treats women \u8212\'20\'14 and where female ministers faced a "sexist onslaught" in the press two months ago over their fashion choices? What about Bosnia, where rape was a national institution? Give over, Rashida \u8212\'20\'14 your Marxism is showing. And it isn't pretty. Socialist Rashida is from South Africa and a Muslim.\par \par \uc2 In her own crime-ridden country, rape is more than commonplace \u8212\'20\'14 it's a way of life.\par \par \uc2 A UN report ranked South Africa number one for rape and stated 41 per cent of victims are children \u8212\'20\'14 and female genital mutiliation is widely practised there and under-reported by a complacent government.\par \par \uc2 How DARE this woman call herself a feminist? The reaction on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  was one of total contempt.\par \par \uc2 "Has the UN forgotten how it sat back on Rwanda?" asked one tweeter.\par \par \uc2 We've had Maggie Thatcher as Prime Minister. Theresa May is Home Secretary.\par \par \uc2 And Justine Greening is the unfortunate Cabinet minister who has to deal with Rashida and her like at the UN, as she hands out aid to fight discrimination against women in the failed dictatorships that they prefer to London.\par \par \uc2 But the UN has never had a woman as Secretary-General \u8212\'20\'14 and only one of its four top jobs is held by a woman.\par \par \uc2 Do you think that's why genderapartheid Saudi Arabia sits on the UN's Human Rights Council? Shall we remind Rashida of women's "human" rights in Saudi Arabia? They are lashed for driving and required to obey a male "guardian" wherever they go \u8212\'20\'14 including travelling abroad.\par \par \uc2 They have no rights over their children and rape in marriage is legal there.\par \par \uc2 No, really, UN! Terrific job on women's rights! The UN is a bloody disgrace. Their last "rapporteur" was antigovernment too \u8212\'20\'14 protesting against George Osborne's welfare reforms. You know, the ones that recently made us the fastest-growing economy in the G7.\par \par \uc2 In the UK women get things done And be of no doubt \u8212\'20\'14 you pay Rashida's wages.\par \par \uc2 Our UN dues sent this woman to Britain to criticise government policy on women \u8212\'20\'14 while she REFUSED to visit any governmentfunded shelters for domestic violence that she was invited to.\par \par \uc2 No bloody wonder they wouldn't let her into Yarl's Wood \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  centre \u8212\'20\'14 the UN has an anti-British agenda and an anti-capitalist one, too.\par \par \uc2 Clearly Rashida knew just what she was going to say before she had the privilege of touching down in the country of Mrs Pankhurst, Boadecia and Elizabeth I. This is a country where women get things done \u8212\'20\'14 unlike her own.\par \par \uc2 This is the country of Jane Austen and Florence Nightingale, the country of Mary Wollstonecraft, founder of feminism. It's the country of self-made millionaires Martha Lane Fox and Tamara Mellon.\par \par \uc2 It's the country of Beatrix Potter and J.K. Rowling \u8212\'20\'14 of Kate Bush, the Spice Girls and Baroness Trumpington.\par \par \uc2 UK women have run \uc2 MI6\uc2 , defeated the Armada, invented nursing, and pioneered astronomy and \u8212\'20\'14 in Mary Somerville \u8212\'20\'14 popular science.\par \par \uc2 Culturally, militarily, in the arts, music, science, business and politics, British women have led the world. What, precisely, has the UN done? What wars has it stopped? How many women has it saved from rape and mutilation? The UN is arguably even a force against the liberation of women.\par \par \uc2 It sanitises Saudi Arabian and other African and Middle Eastern countries' abuse of women under the flag of "cultural rights".\par \par \uc2 Who sits with the Saudis on that "human rights" committee? A roll-call of the worst offenders: Algeria, Morocco, China, Rashida's South Africa, Namibia, Russia, and Vietnam.\par \par \uc2 The lot of them are cesspits for women's equality.\par \par \uc2 It's as a "Rapporteur" \u8212\'20\'14 that's pretentious for "reporter" \u8212\'20\'14 of this very UN Committee, the one with Saudi Arabia and South Africa on it, that Rashida Manjoo took her business class flight to the UK to slam us for being sexist.\par \par \uc2 Well, take a hike, sister. And if you want to find "in your face sexism", take a look around your own UN committee room.\par \par \uc2 You'll find it everywhere. But don't get too close to the Saudi delegation.\par \par \uc2 They don't want a female like you sitting anywhere near them.\par \par \uc2 HOW WE COMPARE WHEN it comes to the worldwide sisterhood, how does the UK really measure up? Using official \uc2 World Bank\uc2  data, we compare Britain's record on women with that of other nations and use the Global Gender Gap Report to give each a sexism rating.\par \par \uc2 UNITED KINGDOM Female prime minister Yes Death in childbirth per 100k Female literacy Female prime minister Yes Female unemployment 7.4% 12 98%+ Females in higher education 70.7% Equality score 74.3% Female unemployment 7.4% 12 98%+ Females in higher education 70.7% Equality score 74.3% ALGERIA Female prime minister No Female unemployment 18.6% Death in childbirth per 100k 97 Female literacy 63.9% Females in higher education 36% 63.9% Females in higher education 36% Equality score 59.66% Equality score 59.66% ITALY Female prime minister Noprime minister No Female unemployment 11.9% Death in childbirth per 100k 4 Female literacy 98%+ Females in higher education 75.4% Equality score 68.85% 75.4% Female prime minister Noprime minister No FemaleFemale unemployment 30.5% Death in childbirth per 100k 8 Female literacy 96.7% Females in higher education 43% Equality score 69.8.6% Death in childbirth per 100k 8 Female literacy 96.7% Females in higher education 43% Equality score 69.86% AZERBAIJAN Female prime minister Noprime minister No FemaleFemale unemployment 6.5% Death in childbirth per 100k 43 Female literacy 98%+ Females in higher education 19.8% Equality score 65.82% 65.82% INDIA Female prime minister Yes Female unemployment 4% Death in childbirth per 100k 200 Female literacy 65.5% Female prime minister Yes Female unemployment 4% Death in childbirth per 100k 200 Female literacy 65.5% Females in higher education 20.3% Equality score 65.51% Equality score 65.51% CROATIA Death in childbirth 17 17 Female prime minister Yesprime minister Yes FemaleFemale unemployment 15.7% Death in childbirth per 100k Female literacy 98%+ Females in higher education Equality score 70.69% 68.8% 68.8%\par \par \uc2 Rapporteur ...

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Matriarch of an Italian ice cream-making dynasty who was a stalwart of many Isle of Wight charities\par \par \uc2 Fondly nicknamed "the Queen Mum of the Isle of Wight" Gloria Minghella, matriarch of the island's most famous creative family and founder of the award-winning Minghella ice cream company, dedicated more than 60 years to the business of serving others.\par \par \uc2 During her working life she handed out knickerbocker glories and advice from a buzzing caf\u233\'00\'E9 on Ryde high street, the hub of the gelateria she and her husband Edward, both of Italian descent, established in 1950. In later years she was a mayor, magistrate and deputy lieutenant of the island; one of the first female prison volunteers, an energetic fundraiser, and instigator of the Isle of Wight's first Citizens Advice Bureau. In 2007 she was appointed MBE for her commitment to charity.\par \par \uc2 Her five talented children grew up in and out of ice-cream vans. Minghella's eldest son, Anthony (obituary, March 19, 2008), theOscar-winning director of The English Patient, Cold Mountain and Breaking and Entering began his relationship with Hollywood selling tubs of Minghella's goods at the cinema next door to his parents' caf\u233\'00\'E9.\par \par \uc2 When he held aloft his Academy Award in 1997 he declared it a great day for the Isle of Wight. Minghella whipped up a new flavour \u8212\'20\'14 "Champagne Celebration" \u8212\'20\'14 to mark the occasion. For the London premiere of The Talented Mr Ripley they made "Ripley's Downfall", which consisted of caramel pieces in dark chocolate.\par \par \uc2 The family were heartbroken when Anthony died suddenly in 2008, aged 54, of a hemorrhage after surgery for throat cancer. Anthony likened the experience of working on a busy film set to the Minghella family kitchen, also the restaurant kitchen, where "every single person or event, every tragedy, every crisis, every failure, every piece of mischief, every regret was played out in public".\par \par \uc2 Minghella's daughter Loretta, a lawyer and chief executive of Christian Aid, said her parents would work "29 hours a day, eight days a week". Meal times were noisy: "family, friends, waifs and strays, everyone would be round the table together in the shop. We have a very strong sense of family but a strong sense of being part of a much bigger community." Minghella's second son, Dominic, is a television screenwriter, best known for the series Doc Martin, her eldest daughter Gioia runs the family ice cream business and Edana is a jazz singer.\par \par \uc2 Gloria Alberta Acari was born in 1930 in Leeds to an Italian \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  family originally from Valvori, a village near Monte Cassino. After her parents' marriage broke down, she and her sisters Betty and Leonora were brought up by her mother Louisa at a time when there was much stigma attached to fatherless families. She later said: "In those days broken families and dysfunctional families didn't exist. We were regarded as secondclass citizens." The girls helped their mother run a caf\u233\'00\'E9 in Glasgow during the war. They were musical and would sing to entertain customers, mostly servicemen. Minghella went to a convent school, later expressing regret that she left education in her teens \u8212\'20\'14 "I would have loved to have been either a lawyer or a writer" \u8212\'20\'14 and was exceptionally proud that her children went into both professions.\par \par \uc2 The Acari family moved to Ryde in 1947 to take over the Mayfayre caf\u233\'00\'E9. Here she met Edward Minghella at a Christmas Eve dance. He impressed her with his knowledge of Dickens, despite never having had a formal education, and they were married in 1950.\par \par \uc2 In an interview 57 years later Minghella said of her husband "he remains as fascinating to me as at the first moment." Though Edward Minghella had been brought up on a buffalo farm in Italy, he learnt to be a master gelatier in the Italian community of Portsmouth. Serving from Gloria's mother's caf\u233\'00\'E9 and a small fleet of vans, he and his new wife introduced exotic ice cream to the people of Ryde at a time when it was only ever eaten in one flavour. Minghella's, made of milk and cream from Channel Island cows direct from Isle of Wight farms, now offers more than 200 varieties and exclusively stocks \uc2 Fortnum &Mason\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 From the beginning, though, the caf\u233\'00\'E9 was more than just a place to get a cone for the beach. Minghella said of its early days: "People would talk to Edward and me about their problems \u8212\'20\'14 matrimonial and financial, or family or a neighbour dispute, and of course we'd never turn anyone away. We took them ourselves to lawyers. It was a caf\u233\'00\'E9 very much known as a place where people could get help."\par \par \uc2 When her third child had left for university, Minghella decided to volunteer as a visitor at Parkhurst prison. The prisoners rejected her at first but she persisted for ten years and said the experience of advising those struggling was very rewarding. Already a local councillor, she was asked to become a magistrate and believed she could use what she had learnt talking to prisoners to "contribute something extra".\par \par \uc2 She was involved in introducing what became the Isle of Wight's Citizens Advice Bureau after spotting an appeal in the newspaper for help to create a centre for people in distress.\par \par \uc2 After her sister Leonora died from motor neurone disease, Minghella set up the Isle of Wight Motor Neurone Disease Association to give carers and sufferers information and support. She endorsed many other causes including Friends of St Mary's Hospital, the Historical Ryde Society, the Island Dance and Drama Festival and the Isle of Wight Catholic History Society. Each year she could be found cheerfully shaking a collection tin at the Ryde Carnival.\par \par \uc2 Her philosophy of life was simple: "You put in what you can, no matter how little that is, you don't know how far the ripples will go."\par \par \uc2 Gloria Minghella, MBE, ice-cream maker, was born on October 20, 1930. She died on March 27, 2014, aged 83\par \par \uc2 She handed out knickerbocker glories from the family's caf\u233\'00\'E9\par \par \uc2 The Minghella family introduced exotic flavours to the people of Ryde\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140417ea4h0005z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Surge in appeals predicted as national 'offer day' leaves four in 10 infants in some areas without a place at their parents' favoured primary\par \par \uc2 UP TO four in 10 children have missed out on theirfirst choice primary school in parts of England and hundreds of pupils were left without a place.\par \par \uc2 There were warnings of a mounting admissions crisis and officials were told to brace themselves for a surge in appeals as school allocations for 600,000 children were published on national "offer day" for primaries yesterday.\par \par \uc2 In some areas children were not allocated any places in reception classes at all, including 75 infants in one borough.\par \par \uc2 One admissions expert said some parents had been given schools two or three miles away despite living within a few hundred yards of the gates of a state primary, leaving them "distraught". Data obtained by The Daily Telegraph showed an overall rise in the number of fouryear\u8211\'20\'13olds entering the education system this year. It has been put down to a spike in the birth rate combined with the effect of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  in some areas.\par \par \uc2 More than half of local authorities reported a decline on last year in parents securing their preferred school, with parts of the South hit hardest.\par \par \uc2 The disclosure prompted warnings that more parents were preparing to appeal against allocations. The number is expected to eclipse the 31,150 made in 2010\u8211\'20\'1311, the last national figures to be published.\par \par \uc2 Graham Jones, an education consultant who helps families challenge admissions rulings, said: "It's been my busiest day ever." John Chard, head of School Appeals, which advises parents, said: "I would imagine that we're going to see an increase in appeals, particularly in these pinch points where there's not enough primary school places."\par \par \uc2 The Government insists \u163\'00\'A35billion will have been spent over this parliament to expand primary schools, with 260,000 extra places created already.\par \par \uc2 Ministers have blamed Labour for the shortfall, saying the party did not address the problem. But Mary Bousted, general secretary of the \uc2 Association of Teachers and Lecturers\uc2 , said an increase in academies and free schools made it harder for councils. "The Government, for all the money they are throwing at the problem, haven't got the mechanism or ability to plan school provision where it is needed."\par \par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph found that:\par \par \uc2 Nationally, about one in seven pupils \u8211\'20\'13 86,000 \u8211\'20\'13 is likely to have missed out on theirfirst choice school;\par \par \uc2 The squeeze on places was worse in the South, including Brighton, Bristol, East Sussex, Essex, Kent, Milton Keynes, North Somerset, Poole and Wiltshire;\par \par \uc2 Rejections were highest in London. In Kensington and Chelsea, 38 per cent failed at theirfirst choice, and 23 per cent were rejected from at least three schools;\par \par \uc2 In the Midlands, the councils of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Dudley and Solihull also reported fewer first choice allocations. Numbers also fell in northern authorities such as Liverpool, Wakefield, Knowsley and Co Durham;\par \par \uc2 In some areas, several children were not given a place, including 75 in Richmond upon Thames;\par \par \uc2 But more children gained places at their preferred school in several areas, including Stoke, Rutland, North East Lincolnshire and Middlesbrough.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the Department for Education said: "We are increasing the number of good school places by tackling underperformance and opening new free schools and academies." Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, said David Cameron was failing "to provide enough good places for every child".\par \par \uc2 Editorial Comment: Page 25\par \par \uc2 Pressure points Local authority % first % one choice of three choices The best Rutland 97 99 North East Lincolnshire 96.97 n/a Doncaster 96.7 98.7 Shropshire 95.8 98.5 Central Bedfordshire 95 98 And worst Lewisham 75.42 n/a Hammersmith and Fulham 74.5 89 Islington 74.2 n/a Wandsworth 73.26 n/a Kensington and Chelsea 61.59 77.3\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140417ea4h0007y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features; Opinion, Column\par \b \uc2 Watch out, David: my Tory friend is voting Ukip\b0\par\par\uc2 Allison Pearson   \par \uc2 412 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 April 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph\par \uc2 DT\par \uc2 2; National\par 27\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 We were out walking the dogs the other morning when my friend Deborah announced she was going to vote Ukip in the May local elections. I nearly fell over the poodle.\par \par \uc2 Deborah is the most 100 per cent cast\u8211\'20\'13iron solid, loyal Conservative female voter since Margaret Hilda Thatcher. Why would she suddenly throw in her lot with Nigel Farage and his motley crew?\par \par \uc2 "If the Prime Minister thinks that people who hold views like mine are swivel\u8211\'20\'13eyed loons, then I want to give him a bloody nose," Deborah said sharply.\par \par \uc2 My guess is that she's far from alone. Ukip posters are blooming in some unlikely windows. It's no longer just alienated country folk; I'm told Fulham is now (ahem) a hotbed of Faragistes.\par \par \uc2 There is a sense that \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  has taken his traditional Tory voter base for granted. As Deborah said to me: "He has raped the nice ladies in hats and suits who turned up to do his flower arranging. On gay marriage, even his own mother was saying: 'I know, but he won't listen.'"\par \par \uc2 Yikes. The truth is, Ukip is no longer just a protest vote for cranky Europhobes. People read about that comprehensive school in Leeds where all 314 pupils are being taught English as a foreign language and they see, with dreadful clarity, that politicians long ago lost the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  plot.\par \par \uc2 Operation Trojan Horse, an investigation into an alleged plot by Islamic extremists, will focus on claims that religious hardliners tried to overthrow secular head teachers in Birmingham schools, and segregated boys and girls. While politicians and police bickered this week over whether a former counter\u8211\'20\'13terrorism man should lead that inquiry, the rest of the population was simply slack\u8211\'20\'13jawed with disbelief. How on earth had this been allowed to happen in our lovely, tolerant country?\par \par \uc2 Why was Santa Claus suddenly banned from handing out presents at Ladypool Primary School in Birmingham to delighted, mainly Muslim children? Last year, Vicky Hubble, the teacher behind the event, was told by the new head that Santa's visit would be cancelled and there would be "no mention" of Jesus being the son of God.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister should stop showing his white, hairless legs in Lanzarote, put some trousers on and get back to deliver a stirring message to the Deborahs, before they give him a bloody nose.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140417ea4h0007o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 Invasive foreign species pose a threat to the global ecosystem. So when will we learn not to meddle with nature?\b0\par\par\uc2 Colin Tudge   \par \uc2 1,442 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 April 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph\par \uc2 DT\par \uc2 1; National\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Britain is being invaded by aliens and it is not just native species but human life that may be affected. Colin Tudge looks at what can be done\par \par \uc2 Twelve thousand alien species of animals and plants from other lands have taken up residence in Europe, according to the \uc2 European Union\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 and as human traffic and trade grow, that influx will surely increase. So, according to the House of Commons environmental audit committee in its latest report on invasive non\u8211\'20\'13native species, it is time to do something about it.\par \par \uc2 But does the influx really matter? Isn't there an upside, too? In any case, what can be done? Invasion by alien species certainly does matter.\par \par \uc2 Right now, biologists say, the world is in the throes of a mass extinction \u8211\'20\'13 the seventh in the history of life on Earth; one of the biggest, and by far the fastest. Half of all our fellow species are conservatively estimated to be in imminent danger of extinction, including "keystone" species such as the elephants of Africa and Asia, which set the tone of entire ecosystems; all the big cats; and many, if not most, of the primates.\par \par \uc2 The biggest cause across the board is loss of habitat (though poaching is accounting for many of the more saleable and edible species) \u8211\'20\'13 but the second biggest, it is estimated, is invasion by alien species. Islands are the most vulnerable and over the past few centuries many worldwide have been virtually wiped clean of their native, typically unique species, by introduced goats and rats and weeds \u8211\'20\'13 or at least seriously depleted, like Hawaii, which has lost an entire suite of flightless geese and ducks and a host of native plants, thanks in part to pigs imported for food and ants that arrived on goodness knows what.\par \par \uc2 Australia is an island, too, albeit on a continental scale, and some biologists claim that most of its native marsupials are endangered or under threat \u8211\'20\'13 mostly through predation by European foxes and feral cats, and competition from European rabbits, and of course from sheep and cattle.\par \par \uc2 Britain also has scores of introduced species, some of which do obvious harm to the native species \u8211\'20\'13 including, if we count the ones that came in a long time ago, the house mouse, the brown rat and the rabbit. In more recent times, the grey squirrel, the mink and the muntjac arrived, plus a host of insects and other invertebrates, as well as plants such as the rhododendron from the Himalayas, which has played havoc with native woodland plants in Wales, and Japanese knotweed, which lays all before it to waste.\par \par \uc2 Some might ask, so what? Who cares if a few species that most people don't know are there disappear? Money, is one obvious response. Britain's invaders cost us around \u163\'00\'A32 billion a year.\par \par \uc2 Human security is another, for the net effect of invasion is always to reduce species diversity. One importunate invader can compromise or wipe out dozens of native species \u8211\'20\'13 like the European wasps in New Zealand that thrive on the honeydew from the native southern beech (Nothofagus), go forth and multiply, then prey on the native insects. Some scientists are relaxed about these wipeouts, but many feel that with too much extinction the whole global ecosystem could collapse, taking large numbers of us with it.\par \par \uc2 The most powerful answer, though, is moral and spiritual. Invasions of foreign species have occurred since life began, but the rate of transfer has risen exponentially in recent centuries, and most of the increase has been caused by humans. This has clearly led to many hundreds of extinctions and our hand in this should surely be seen as a crime against nature.\par \par \uc2 There can be an upside, of course. It made sense to reintroduce the whitetailed sea eagle to the western isles of Scotland, and the reintroduction of the European crane and great bustard to south\u8211\'20\'13west and southern England is now taking place. Though purists would object, it would not be at all foolish to establish semi\u8211\'20\'13wild populations of black rhinoceros in Texas. They are devilish hard to conserve in their native Africa and the rhinoceros family seems to have arisen in North America in the deep past. North America is short of big mammals, since it lost most of them (including its mammoths, mastodons, giant bears and giant wolves) in the Great Pleistocene Extinction, around 10\u8211\'20\'1312,000 years ago. Besides, big, slow\u8211\'20\'13breeding species are easy to cull if they get out of hand (and are all too easily wiped out).\par \par \uc2 On the whole, though, humanity's conscious attempts to rearrange the world's fauna and flora have either failed (which is generally the best result) or proved disastrous. The rabbits, cats, foxes and cane toads now wrecking Australia's wildlife, and the Australian possums causing mayhem in New Zealand, were all introduced with intentions that were felt to be good at the time: the rabbits for food, the cats for companionship, the foxes to pursue with view halloo, the toads to kill rats in the sugar\u8211\'20\'13cane plantations, and the possums for their fur.\par \par \uc2 In the 19th century, wave after wave of British songbirds were taken to Australia to remind the British \u233\'00\'E9migr\u233\'00\'E9s of home, and generally to cheer the place up: the squawks of the native parrots and "magpies" did not please them at all. (Most of the imports perished, some disappearing without trace within minutes of release, although the European blackbird is now among Australia's top 20 birds \u8211\'20\'13 at least in numbers, though not alas in popularity, because gardeners think it messes up their flowerbeds.)\par \par \uc2 Britain was keen on imports, too: the \uc2 Zoological Society of London\uc2  was founded in 1826 in part to \uc2 seek\uc2  out foreign animals that could be turned into livestock at home, and Captain Cook had botanists on board (notably Sir Joseph Banks) to find useful and ornamental plants. Many are still with us, not least the now ubiquitous eucalyptus.\par \par \uc2 Deep into the 20th century the madness continued. So it was that the French introduced the giant African land snail Achatina into various South Sea islands to which they laid claim, including Tahiti and Moorea, as food for the natives. Then, when Achatina got out of hand, they introduced the predatory snail Euglandina (some snails are remarkably effective predators, such as whelks). But Achatina proved too much of a handful and the Euglandina turned instead to the small native Partula snails. For some time, London Zoo has been breeding some of the last remaining species of Partula. (It requires skill, but they don't take up a lot of room.)\par \par \uc2 At the start of the 20th century, one of the commonest broadleaf trees in the eastern United States was the American chestnut, whose fruits had supported whole civilisations of native Americans for hundreds of years, as well as a host of wild creatures and the first European \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . But do\u8211\'20\'13gooding foresters decided to introduce Asian chestnuts, which have bigger nuts; and they brought with them a parasitic blight fungus that drove the native trees to virtual extinction in a decade or so \u8211\'20\'13 a wipe\u8211\'20\'13out matched only by the collapse of the passenger pigeon at about the same time (though that was caused by too much hunting).\par \par \uc2 So what is to be done? The EU and the environmental audit committee's report recommend a "framework for action", which certainly sounds good, and would include a combination of legislation and voluntary restraint. In truth, though, once a species is established it can be almost impossible to eradicate \u8211\'20\'13 and attempts to do so, as the Euglandina/Partula story demonstrates, tend merely to compound the disaster.\par \par \uc2 There is much wild talk from on high of "controlling" or even "conquering" nature \u8211\'20\'13 talk much loved by gung\u8211\'20\'13ho scientists and politicians \u8211\'20\'13 while ads in farming magazines talk of genetically modified organisms or pesticides. In truth \u8211\'20\'13 and this is one of the greatest lessons of modern ecology \u8211\'20\'13 we just don't know enough to "control" nature, and never will. Nature is immeasurably complex and full of unknowns of the "unknown unknowns" variety.\par \par \uc2 By the same token, we cannot hope to control the Pandora's box of vagrant species simply by legislation. Above all, we need a change of attitude \u8211\'20\'13 to acknowledge our own ignorance and to treat nature with extreme caution and respect. The disasters so far all spring from hubris. We have mistaken our own role in the world and hugely overestimated our own ability to understand.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140417ea4h0003d\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Editorial; Opinion, Columns\par \b \uc2 We'll only tackle the UK productivity disease by taking on vested interests\b0\par\par\uc2 DOMINIC RAAB   \par \uc2 821 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 April 2014\par \uc2 City AM\par \uc2 CITYMO\par \uc2 1; National\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014. CITY AM.   \par \par \uc2 THIS week has brought more bright economic news - with falling inflation and unemployment paving the way for rising real wages. Yet while the UK is now the fastest growing developed economy, the productivity of its workforce languishes a fifth below the G7 average. What can be done to cure this British disease? US economist \uc2 Paul Krugman\uc2  reckons that "in the long-run [productivity] is almost everything". If he's right, it's troubling for Britain. The gap between UK productivity and the rest of the G7 has grown since 2000. Britain lags 31 percentage points behind Germany and 35 off the US.\par \par \uc2 The root causes are political. For a country with high government spending (still well above the OECD average despite austerity), the UK has squandered it on the wrong things - from subsidising longer retirement, to a welfare system that (until recently) was more interested in re-distributing wealth than providing a social safety net. As well as pushing up debt and taxes, it left too little money for infrastructure or R&D.\par \par \uc2 We're twenty-eighth on the \uc2 World Economic Forum\uc2  infrastructure quality rankings, behind Taiwan and Malaysia. British R&D investment is half that of the top European economies. Patent innovation lags behind the international pack. The coalition is rolling out super-fast broadband, and invested \u163\'00\'A392bn in transport, apprenticeships and science during the 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review. But it will take perseverance to correct such entrenched - and skewed - priorities.\par \par \uc2 A legacy of poor choices was compounded by lack of honesty. For all Labour's investment in state schools, grade inflation disguised the dumbing down of standards: we plummeted down the OECD rankings for 15 year olds in maths, science and literacy. For too long, our schools cosseted rather than equipped youngsters for working life. Coalition reforms to restore academic rigour - coupled with investment in wider vocational options - will help reverse that slide.\par \par \uc2 Politicians must also drop bad habits. The addiction to cheap labour from abroad was used by Labour to insulate business from inadequate home-grown skills, encouraging welfare dependency. And controlled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  did not improve economic output, measured by GDP per person. But it suppressed wages and dampened the incentive for firms to invest in plant, training or research to deliver efficiencies.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, a political craving for easy money has added to lacklustre productivity in financial services, which fell 15 per cent between 2008 and 2013. When the financial bubble burst, cheap money released to pull the economy out of its rut kept thousands of zombie firms afloat, yet starved fledgling startups of credit - a lousy allocation of capital.\par \par \uc2 The most endemic political vice is short-termism. Take oil and gas. It is getting harder to extract North Sea oil, and more costly to maintain rigs. The last government's failure to replace six nuclear power stations decommissioned on its watch squeezed energy supply and productivity. Today, plans to exploit UK shale reserves - crucial to any longterm energy strategy - are beset by scaremongering pressure groups, which threaten to drain political will. Add in yawning delays in expanding UK airport capacity, and Britain risks looking like a nation that can't take a long-term decision on major infrastructure. The Budget sought measures to reverse these trends: increased business investment allowances, export finance and new money for road repairs. We must raise our sights further. We need further cuts, not just to reduce debt and taxes, but also to pay for more infrastructure and R&D to strengthen competitiveness. You don't have to yearn for a smaller state to recognise that Britain still has a spending problem - born out of flawed choices.\par \par \uc2 We should cut payroll taxes further, enable "no fault" dismissal of under-performing staff, and allow the low paid to keep performance-related pay tax free. A voting threshold for strike action would stop minorities hollowing out UK productivity - including Luddite union bosses holding back rail modernisation, and teachers trying to stave off reform.\par \par \uc2 Poor productivity haunts sectors with the least competition, like banking, energy and the utilities. All three cry out for a competition overhaul - from introducing portable bank accounts and more new challenger banks, to greater retail competition in the water industry.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, we must reverse the decline, since 1998, in the rate of business investment. One radical idea would be to encourage corporate investment by offering tax breaks and stronger voting rights to longer-term equity investors.\par \par \uc2 A revolution in UK productivity will take political courage. Vested interests will yelp at every turn. As US Fed chair \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  dryly observed: "Most things that contribute to productivity growth are very painful." But Britain has no option - if it is to create and spread prosperity in the fiercely competitive century that lies ahead.\par \par \uc2 Dominic Raab is Conservative MP for Esher & Walton.\par \par \uc2 Document CITYMO0020140417ea4h00002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 UP TO FOUR IN TEN CHILDREN DENIED CHOSEN PRIMARY\b0\par\par\uc2 BY LAURA CLARK    \par \uc2 577 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 April 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 THE growing crisis in primary places saw up to four in ten children denied admission to their chosen schools yesterday.\par \par \uc2 A surge in appeals is expected as families fight their allocation to second, third or even their sixth choice primaries.\par \par \uc2 Many parts of the country saw fewer parents than last year offered the schools they wanted for their children, amid a shortage of places driven by \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and the last decade's baby boom.\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of youngsters are yet to be allocated any school at all, while many face travelling several miles a day.\par \par \uc2 Parents yesterday inundated online forums to complain about their placements and \uc2 seek\uc2  advice.\par \par \uc2 One mother from Yorkshire wrote on the Netmums site: 'Can't stop crying. We were not offered any of the three we put down. We have been offered the worst school ever and it is the 19th furthest away from us. I feel sick.'\par \par \uc2 Another wrote on Mumsnet that her son had been offered a different school to his sister. 'I'm having palpitations at the idea of two kids at different schools.\par \par \uc2 'The logistics don't bear thinking about,' she said.\par \par \uc2 There was also anger that the national 'offer day' for over 600,000 children was scheduled just before Easter weekend, meaning families will have to wait several days to discuss their options with local councils.\par \par \uc2 Figures obtained by the Mail show that most parts of the country have seen an increase in the number of applications this year. More than half of local authorities also report a rise in the number of pupils denied their first-choice schools. Parts of the South were worst hit. Kensington and Chelsea came bottom of the table with 38 per cent of four-year-olds missing out - up from 35 per cent last year. Twenty-three per cent were rejected from three primaries.\par \par \uc2 In nearby Hammersmith and Fulham just over 25 per cent missed out on their first choice, and in Lambeth 21 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Other areas unable to offer as many first-choice places as last year include Kent, Essex, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Brighton, East Sussex, Poole, Milton Keynes and Wiltshire.\par \par \uc2 The news comes despite the Government earmarking \u163\'00\'A35billion to provide more primary places, with more than 230,000 created between 2010 and 2013.\par \par \uc2 But teachers' leaders warned of gaps in planning for shortages. Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the \uc2 Association of Teachers and Lecturers\uc2  union, said: 'We know there is a growing crisis in primary school places.\par \par \uc2 'For all the money they are throwing at the problem, [the Government] simply haven't got the mechanism to plan increased provision where it's needed.'\par \par \uc2 The number of appeals more than doubled to 31,150 between 2007 and 2011 - the last year for which figures are available.\par \par \uc2 Matt Richards, a partner at School Appeals Services, said: 'The interesting thing will be the number of people having to travel further to get to school. There will be parents who have to put their children aged four-and-a-half in a cab with a cab driver. It will be interesting to see how appeals panels react.'\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the Department for Education said: 'We are increasing the number of good school places by tackling underperformance and opening new free schools and academies.\par \par \uc2 'We have also more than doubled the funding available to councils to create new places.'\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140416ea4h0001m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 AN illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  who stabbed a 15-year-old schoolboy to death less than a year after arriving in Britain cannot be deported because he claims to be gay, judges ruled yesterday.\par \par \uc2 The 29-year-old Jamaican was jailed for life aged 16 when he and another schoolboy knifed Abdul Maye to death over a \u163\'00\'A310 debt outside his school in east London.\par \par \uc2 A judge at the Old Bailey ordered that he be kicked out of Britain once he had served a minimum of eight years.\par \par \uc2 Judge Paul Focke told the thug, who cannot not be named for legal reasons: 'You are a Jamaican national and within months of coming to this country you committed murder.\par \par \uc2 'I am of the view that your continued presence in this country will be detrimental to its citizens.'\par \par \uc2 But yesterday, the Court of Appeal ruled that he could not be sent back to Jamaica because he could face degrading treatment for being homosexual that would breach his human rights.\par \par \uc2 In an extraordinary judgment which has provoked outrage, Lord Justice Kay said he believed his mother's evidence that he was gay - even though the Home Office said he 'had made no mention of it' until his first appeal against deportation failed.\par \par \uc2 The decision is expected to infuriate Home Secretary Theresa May, who has battled to send him home since he was released from prison in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: 'Most people would think this is outrageous. It's a gross distortion of the concept of justice.\par \par \uc2 'Until we have freed ourselves from the European Convention on Human Rights, these sorts of basket-case decisions will carry on happening thick and fast.'\par \par \uc2 Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said: 'Whether or not this man is sent back should be entirely at the discretion of British courts.\par \par \uc2 'The idea that his human rights should have any impact whatever when he has come in to this country illegally in the first place to murder someone is absurd.\par \par \uc2 'When it comes to murderers, courts should have the absolute right to sentence people for as long as they want, or to send them home immediately after.'\par \par \uc2 The killer, referred to only as JR, arrived in the UK in December 2000 at the age of 15 on a temporary visa to visit his mother.\par \par \uc2 An application for leave to stay longer was refused, but the yob remained in the country anyway.\par \par \uc2 And less than a year later he and a 14-year-old stabbed a fellow schoolboy to 'save face' after he humiliated them by refusing to pay a \u163\'00\'A310 debt - a payment which he owed them for cannabis.\par \par \uc2 The Old Bailey heard JR, who only has an IQ of 63 - putting him in the lowest two per cent of the population - knifed Abdul in front of his horrified classmates outside Little Ilford Comprehensive School in Manor Park after the victim had just finished a mock GCSE exam on December 7, 2001.\par \par \uc2 The victim, whose family fled to Britain from the civil war in Somalia in 1995, died shortly afterwards in hospital.\par \par \uc2 In the weeks beforehand, the schoolboys had threatened to 'chop' or 'stab' the victim and the Jamaican sprayed him and a friend with CS gas.\par \par \uc2 The pair were jailed for life in September 2002 and told to serve a minimum of eight years and two months. But this was reduced on appeal to six years and two months with the deportation recommendation set aside.\par \par \uc2 However, the Secretary of State ordered JR's deportation in 2009.\par \par \uc2 When his first appeal failed, the killer submitted a fresh bid against deportation in April 2012 arguing for the first time that he was gay.\par \par \uc2 Catherine Rowlands, acting for the Secretary of State, argued that JR's sudden claim of homosexuality after ten years in jail should have been rejected 'on credibility grounds' as 'he had made no mention of it' during the previous asylum application.\par \par \uc2 She argued that 'the claim of homosexuality was contrived and brought as a last resort to avoid deportation'.\par \par \uc2 But the Court of Appeal heard compelling evidence from his mother who said she 'knew all along' that her son was gay and his 'late disclosure' was 'prompted by societal attitudes, particularly that of Jamaicans towards gays'.\par \par \uc2 JR was released in June 2012 and since then the matter has been going through the courts, but yesterday three judges at the Court of Appeal blocked the Government's final attempt to have him deported.\par
