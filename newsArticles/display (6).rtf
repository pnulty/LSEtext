All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 The National Front leader in France says Farage's comments were dishonest, writes Hugh Carnegy\par \par \uc2 Marine Le Pen has launched an outspoken attack on Nigel Farage , leader of Britain's UK Independence party, for labelling her National Front party racist in the run-up to European elections at the end of May.\par \par \uc2 "[UK premier David] Cameron said Ukip was a bunch of drunks and racists. [Mr Farage] is no better; he's using arguments against the FN of which he himself has been a victim. It's dishonest," declared Ms Le Pen\par \par \uc2 Speaking in an interview with the Financial Times, she said Mr Farage's stance was a ploy intended to surpass her in the role of the EU's leading eurosceptic after the elections, in which both their parties are vying for victory in their respective countries.\par \par \uc2 "Of course. Clearly it's the main reason for his behaviour. It's an old story between France and England," she said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage, rejecting the FN for its "anti-Semitism and general prejudice", has allied instead in France with a fringe eurosceptic Gaullist group.\par \par \uc2 Expressing her irritation at his "tactical choice", Ms Le Pen said the two had met a number of times: "I have had good contacts with him, and we met members of Ukip in London. There are Ukip members who don't understand his aggression against us."\par \par \uc2 But Ms Le Pen, buoyed by polls showing the FN with a clear chance of topping the European poll in France, said she would not need Ukip to be able to form a strong group of hardline anti-Brussels parties in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  that she said would seek to "block all the federalist advances of the EU".\par \par \uc2 She predicted like-minded parties from the Netherlands, where the FN is allied with the Dutch Freedom party, Austria, Italy, Belgium and Sweden would be able to muster numbers needed to boost the European Alliance for Freedom as the dominant group on the hard nationalist right, eclipsing Ukip.\par \par \uc2 Speaking in her party headquarters in Nanterre, on the outskirts of Paris, Ms Le Pen, fresh from making significant advances in France's local elections in March, branded the EU in her characteristic style as "a big jellyfish" that had been "a fantastic failure".\par \par \uc2 Rejecting accusations that the FN - it takes a hard line against \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , warns of the threat of Islamism in Europe and calls for restoration of national frontier controls - is a racist party, she said a strong showing by the hard right in the elections would signal the "rejection of the European construction".\par \par \uc2 "That means opposing the transatlantic trade negotiations with the US, opposing the austerity imposed by the EU, opposing all new transfers of sovereignty from member states to the EU and all new enlargement of the EU."\par \par \uc2 Ms Le Pen, who has led a rise in popularity of the FN since she took over leadership from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2010, said France needed "intelligent protectionism, our own money and economic patriotism to recover growth - like the US has done".\par \par \uc2 Her campaign for the dismantlement of the euro has been one of the main pillars of her leadership as France's economy has stalled and unemployment increased. "The eurozone is the black hole of global growth over the past 10 years. It is not a coincidence," she says.\par \par \uc2 "The euro will explode. My aim is a concerted, considered exit from the single currency, rather than to wait for the explosion." She proposes instead a reflotation of national currencies, with a revaluation for Germany and a devaluation for France, followed by a return to a system like the precursor European Monetary System that sought to manage exchange rates.\par \par \uc2 Her anti-euro stance has not convinced the public, however, with a BVA poll on Sunday showing 79 per cent of voters did not think it was desirable. It also showed 68 per cent saying they had a bad opinion of Ms Le Pen.\par \par \uc2 She dismissed the poll as politically biased, confident that the flow of polls in recent weeks showing the FN in first or second place on May 25 were what would count. If the party wins, she will proclaim it as a new sign that "those who believe in the nation" are gaining ascendance over Europe's supra-nationalists who have held sway for so long. "That," she says, "is the real divide today" in France and Europe.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140514ea5e0001y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par \uc2 Chancellor \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  is endangering the recovery by "washing his hands" of responsibility for rising house prices and passing the buck to a Bank of England still coming to terms with new regulatory powers, Labour has claimed.\par \par \uc2 Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, said Mr Osborne needed to rein in the Help to Buy scheme in London and put fresh effort into building new towns and more social housing to boost supply.\par \par \uc2 "You can't as chancellor wash your hands of responsibility for balancing the housing market," Mr Balls said, adding that Labour would also use fiscal powers such as a tax on homes worth more than \u163\'00\'A32m to damp price rises.\par \par \uc2 Mr Osborne has called on BoE officials to "use the tools that I've given them" to stop the housing market from overheating; the bank can place restrictions on riskier mortgage lending.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Balls warned that the bank was still trying to make sense of its new structure, in which two separate committees with "a very substantial overlap" in powers and membership are charged with keeping a lid on house price inflation.\par \par \uc2 "The danger when you have a large overlap is that people think it's someone else's responsibility," Mr Balls said in an interview with the Financial Times.\par \par \uc2 He feared that the bank's Monetary Policy Committee could be forced to use "the blunt instrument" of an interest rate rise prematurely to contain London house price inflation, harming the wider economy.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, he claimed the Financial Policy Committee, which is charged with using other tools such as bank lending restrictions to maintain economic stability, had a similar membership and responsibility to the MPC.\par \par \uc2 Although he refused to commit a Labour government to another restructuring of the bank, he said that Mr Osborne's reforms of the BoE were "unfinished business" and it was still unclear where responsibility lay in the event of a crisis.\par \par \uc2 Mr Balls has called on Mr Osborne to cut from \u163\'00\'A3600,000 to \u163\'00\'A3400,000 the threshold for house purchases eligible for government mortgage guarantees under Help to Buy; the chancellor says he is waiting for the BoE to tell him to act.\par \par \uc2 Mr Osborne is likely to say Mr Balls was an architect of Labour's decision to give the BoE independence and was at the Treasury while the last housing bubble was inflating.\par \par \uc2 Mr Balls's comments came ahead of today's Bank of England Inflation Report, in which the central bank will come under pressure to explain how it proposes to cool the housing market without derailing the wider economic recovery.\par \par \uc2 He said Labour was "upbeat" in spite of polls showing the Tories taking a lead for the first time in two years, but he admitted the party was struggling to get its message across, including in areas of economic credibility.\par \par \uc2 Mr Balls said the party needed to "make more noise to say we'll take tough decisions on the deficit" and that it also needed to make "more noise" to show Labour was serious about tackling \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , welfare abuse and reforming the EU.\par \par \uc2 He admitted voters needed reassuring that Labour would "make the sums add up" and that the party understood the need for wealth creation and supported entrepreneurs.\par \par \uc2 Lord Jones, a business minister in the last Labour government, said he believed Mr Miliband was "one of the least business- friendly leaders of political parties I've seen for years".\par \par \uc2 But Mr Balls, seen as a supporter of business and the City in the Labour leadership team, said: "I don't think Labour will win the next election as an anti-business party."\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by \uc2 Chris Giles\par \par \uc2 The shadow chancellor on...\par \par \uc2 House prices\par \par \uc2 'You can't as chancellor wash your hands of

with James Corden following him around for a television documentary that firmly established the Take That man as a national treasure and elder statesman of pop.\par \par \uc2 Is it harsh to strip Gary of his OBE title?[REX]\par \par \uc2 By the weekend, however, the most popular man with stubble in the country was being pilloried for taking part in a tax avoidance scheme with two other members of the band.\par \par \uc2 Strip him of his OBE howled various people\u8217\'20\'19s tribunes, while the social media mob parodied his song titles \u8211\'20\'13 All I Do Each Night is PAYE was my favourite.\par \par \uc2 Considering some of the other people allowed on previous honours lists it seems a bit harsh to strip Barlow of his bauble.\par \par \uc2 But it would be rash to underestimate the sense of grievance in the country about rich pop stars/bankers, etc, who dodge paying their fair share.\par \par \uc2 The episode plays into the hands of the \u8220\'20\'1Cthem and us\u8221\'20\'1D narrative that Ed Miliband is so assiduously cultivating with his energy price freezes, rent controls and that Labour party political broadcast last week, which effectively declared class war.\par \par \uc2 Those are the sort of battle lines which, in the words of another of Gary\u8217\'20\'19s hits, Ed would like to see brought Back For Good.\par \par \uc2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\par \par \uc2 If I\u8217\'20\'19m being honest my first reaction to the news that Britain\u8217\'20\'19s first PoundPub has just opened in Atherton, near Wigan, Greater Manchester, was a bit snobbish.\par \par \uc2 I immediately concluded that it was the sort of place patronised by sad old boozers who drink as automatically as they draw breath .\par \par \uc2 But what was even more predictable than my instinctive first response was the chorus of doom-mongers calling the place \u8220\'20\'1Cirresponsible\u8221\'20\'1D because it sells halves of beer for \u163\'00\'A31 and pints for \u163\'00\'A31.50 with the catchy slogan: \u8220\'20\'1CMore round for your pound\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Its boss insists anyone who looks the worse for wear isn\u8217\'20\'19t served \u8211\'20\'13 and there\u8217\'20\'19s no reason to believe that the police, who report no problems concerned with the business, won\u8217\'20\'19t act accordingly at the first sign of any trouble.\par \par \uc2 The reaction to the PoundPub is merely the latest illustration of that enduring strain in the British character that relishes nothing more than disapproving of something.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2

breakfast show earlier this month, so much so that Chris Evans felt safe in cheekily referring to its main presenter Susanna Reid at an awards ceremony this week as \u8220\'20\'1Cthe former breakfast queen of British television\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 So when an angry Freddie Starr ordered Susanna out of his home after she quizzed him about previous allegations of sex offences I imagine that, far from being perturbed, she and the show\u8217\'20\'19s producers could scarcely believe their luck.\par \par \uc2 Expect to see a procession of old entertainers provoked from now on in an effort to put the ratings up.\par \par \uc2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\par \par \uc2 Ever since I was a kid growing up in West Yorkshire I\u8217\'20\'19ve said \u8220\'20\'1Cta\u8221\'20\'1D \u8211\'20\'13 the diminutive of thank you \u8211\'20\'13 in everyday conversation.\par \par \uc2 My mum, despite being born and bred there herself, disapproved of such vulgar usage, just as she always tried to persuade me to say \u8220\'20\'1Cbar-th\u8221\'20\'1D for \u8220\'20\'1Cbath\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 She thought it would improve my future prospects.\par \par \uc2 I regret to report she failed in her endeavours.\par \par \uc2 Last week my 16-year-old son revealed \u8211\'20\'13 during one of those rare conversations we have now that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t include the phrases \u8220\'20\'1Cwhat time are you coming home?\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1Cso when exactly are you planning to

over Labour.\par \par \uc2 Mrs Thatcher hands over the deeds of a council house in 1980[PA]\par \par \uc2 Critics may dismiss this as a blip but two polls in the past 48 hours show a marginal lead for the Conservatives.\par \par \uc2 The ICM poll places the Tories on 33 per cent, with Labour behind at 31.\par \par \uc2 Separate research for Lord Ashcroft, former Conservative deputy chairman, puts his party on 34 per cent and Labour on 32.\par \par \uc2 These results are based on people\u8217\'20\'19s voting intention in next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election as opposed to next week\u8217\'20\'19s European election.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron may well get the sense the tide is starting to turn.\par \par \uc2 This will be some much needed good news ahead of what many believe will be a battering at next week\u8217\'20\'19s Euro poll at the hands of Ukip.\par \par \uc2 Both the Labour and Conservative parties have drafted in election strategists to help them win a decent majority in 2015 but they are neglecting a vital chunk of the electorate \u8211\'20\'13 the working-class vote.\par \par \uc2 This support is going begging and one of the keys to success next year will be not only to gain this vote but to nurture and continue to own it.\par \par \uc2 Margaret Thatcher achieved this in the 1980s, particularly with her policy of selling council houses, but none of today\u8217\'20\'19s parties has managed to speak to those voters in the same way.\par \par \uc2 We are talking about people with aspirations and who want social mobility.\par \par \uc2 They also crave to be recognised for the contribution they already make to society through their work and taxes.\par \par \uc2 They want fair policies on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and welfare, as well as being rewarded for what they have already achieved.\par \par \uc2 Occupations include electricians and postal workers; retail cashiers and plumbers; catering staff, nurses and care workers; customer service operatives and bar staff; van drivers and cleaners.\par \par \uc2 The working-class vote exists in what many would call the \u8220\'20\'1Cblue collar\u8221\'20\'1D sector.\par \par \uc2 It is also to be found with many \u8220\'20\'1Cwhite collar\u8221\'20\'1D workers too.\par \par \uc2 Who speaks to these voters and which party will ultimately get their support?\par \par \uc2 For the Conservatives to maintain their lead over Labour and harness this vote they need to be doing a lot more than chucking around the overused phrase \u8220\'20\'1Chardworking families\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Miliband's politics are clearly aimed towards the working class [PA]\par \par \uc2 But there are a number of Conservative MPs who already recognise this and have set up a group called Blue Collar Conservatism.\par \par \uc2 Co-ordinator Clark Vasey sums it up nicely: \u8220\'20\'1CGrowing up in a working-class family in the North of England showed me how working people have been let down time and again by Labour, as the party which favours control over empowerment.\par \par \uc2 It was my mother\u8217\'20\'19s belief in self-reliance which shaped my values and led me to become a Conservative.\par \par \uc2 I remain convinced that it is the Conservative party which will best serve the interests of bluecollar voters.\u8221\'20\'1D Blue Collar Conservatism contains some solid names and faces such as Wirral West\u8217\'20\'19s Esther McVey.\par \par \uc2 A scouser by birth and currently a minister, Esther has talent that David Cameron needs to be using to a greater extent.\par \par \uc2 The same goes for Philip Davies, MP for Shipley, and John Stevenson, MP for Carlisle \u8211\'20\'13 these men connect with voters who feel today\u8217\'20\'19s Conservative party does not fully represent them.\par \par \uc2 Davies spent a big part of his life working for a supermarket chain in customer services and marketing before entering politics.\par \par \uc2 It is this kind of background that David Cameron needs to embrace in order to shed the Tories\u8217\'20\'19 \u8220\'20\'1Ctoff\u8221\'20\'1D image.\par \par \uc2 Ukip is currently doing well in mopping up the workingclass vote.\par \par \uc2 By-election results in the North of England have seen Ukip come second to Labour in areas such as South Shields, Wythenshawe and Sale East and Barnsley Central.\par \par \uc2 One of Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s stars is deputy leader Paul Nuttall.\par \par \uc2 Born on a Merseyside council estate in Bootle he instinctively understands the frustrations and challenges facing people every day.\par \par \uc2 It should come as no surprise that Ukip is coming second in by-elections but it should greatly concern Ed Miliband as it is eating into what was once Labour\u8217\'20\'19s core vote.\par \par \uc2 Labour peer Lord Glasman has already said his party\u8217\'20\'19s working-class support has \u8220\'20\'1Cdied\u8221\'20\'1D and he believes that Labour has become \u8220\'20\'1Cvery middle class\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 I remember working in Liverpool in 2009 and sitting in a pub when the man next to me struck up a conversation about politics.\par \par \uc2 In fact it was not so much a conversation, more a diatribe about how he felt let down by a party that he had supported all his life.\par \par \uc2 I have never forgotten the words of this ex-docker: \u8220\'20\'1CThe Labour party is no longer the party of the working man.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband talks a good game which is clearly designed to appeal to the working-class vote.\par \par \uc2 His \u8220\'20\'1Ccost of living crisis\u8221\'20\'1D narrative should tick all the boxes but it always appears to be delivered without any real conviction or understanding.\par \par \uc2 A token mention should go the Liberal Democrats but, as with the Green party, I can see little on offer to secure significant working-class support.\par \par \uc2 The working-class vote is up for grabs.\par \par \uc2 None of the parties are doing enough to make it theirs which is a gross oversight with less than a year to go to the general election.\par \par \uc2

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Trio arrested under the Terrorism Act following a spike in racist assaults and incidents across Belfast\par \par \uc2 Police in Belfast were questioning three suspects on Tuesday night after finding a gun and a quantity of drugs during raids in the east of the city.\par \par \uc2 The arrest of two men and a woman in east Belfast was an part of a Police Service of Northern Ireland operation to counter a rise in racist attacks over the last few weeks.\par \par \uc2 There have been at least five recorded incidents of racial intimidation in east Belfast including a young Roma cyclist being showered with a bag of excrement on the Newtonards Road a fortnight ago.\par \par \uc2 A PSNI spokesman said the men aged 43 and 41 and a 41-year-old woman were detained in the Castlereagh area of east Belfast earlier on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The police spokesman added: "Detectives working as part of Operation Reiner have conducted searches in the Castlereagh area as part of their ongoing investigations into the recent increase of hate crimes being committed across Belfast.\par \par \uc2 "During the course of these searches, officers recovered a firearm, ammunition and a small quantity of suspected drugs. Two males and a female have been arrested by virtue of Section 41 of the Terrorism Act and they are currently assisting police with their enquiries."\par \par \uc2 Given that the arrests were carried out under the Terrorism Act this indicates that detectives are exploring a possible link between the racial violence and loyalist paramilitary groups in the area specificially the \uc2 Ulster Volunteer Force\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Although the UVF's political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, has come out strongly against the spike in racist assaults and incidents the loyalist terror group now operates on a de-centralised level with local units acting independently from its old leadership base in Belfast's Shankill Road. The east Belfast UVF is known to include members who have been engaged in racist incidents over the last few years.\par \par \uc2 The latest of these incidents happened on Tuesday morning with graffiti appearing on a gable wall, carrying a racist message against Polish \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . It is understood to be on a derelict property and no one was inside at the time.\par \par \uc2 The PSNI pledged to continue to act against racists invovled in hate crimes in Belfast and beyond.\par \par \uc2 "Our priority in the coming weeks and months will be enforcement - arrests, searches and charges - to reassure victimised communities that we can act quickly and effectively, and provide a deterrent to people engaged in this criminality.\par \par \uc2 "However, hate crime is an under-reported crime and as a result, we need to ensure victims have the confidence to report these incidents."\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140513ea5e000gz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Elections: Ukip's black candidates vie for voters in Croydon's melting pot\b0\par\par\uc2 Robert Booth   \par \uc2 1,339 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Before the singing, dancing and sermons, the preacher in Croydon held up the voting form for next week's election and fixed his congregation's attention.\par \par \uc2 "You have a choice of 15 different political parties," he told the mostly black worshippers at the Elim Pentecostal church. "If you believe in democracy you should vote for a party. This is not a party political broadcast from me but you have that choice."\par \par \uc2 Influencing which box they tick is a significant new challenge facing Britain's political class. The UK's ethnic minority groups are predicted to grow from 14% to 30% of the population by 2050 and the parties are wrestling with how to respond. With a week to go until the European and local elections, Croydon, in south London, with its tight marginal seats and minority population heading towards 70%, is a key battleground.\par \par \uc2 "The local MPs want to come and see me because they know that on a Sunday I can get over 500 people coming in," said the pastor, Cornelius Osei-Fosu, after a service which touched on Syria, church expansion and the rapture. "It is not about befriending me, but getting those votes."\par \par \uc2 The worshippers dancing to I Am Glad I Belong to Jesus included people from west Africa, southern Africa, the Caribbean, Asia and Europe - 40 nationalities that give a snapshot of Croydon's future.\par \par \uc2 The Tory MP for Croydon Central, \uc2 Gavin Barwell\uc2 , has described the demographic shift as an existential threat to the Conservatives, whose national vote among the country's five largest ethnic minority groups was just 16% at the 2010 general election, compared with 68% for Labour.\par \par \uc2 For its part, Ukip is trying to counter \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's labelling of the party as closet racists by fielding nine black candidates for seats on \uc2 Croydon council\uc2  and appealing to migrants with a new pro-Commonwealth outlook.\par \par \uc2 Two of those candidates are Ace Nnorom and Herman "Coach" Lyken.\par \par \uc2 Until last year, Nnorom, a Cameroon-born lecturer in public and international law, was a Labour activist involved in David Miliband's Movement for Change, an initiative to create a nationwide network of community organisers.\par \par \uc2 Lyken, a former soldier from Guyana who runs boot camps for delinquent youths, quit the Conservatives to run for Ukip. Both men found progress tough in the main parties. "I wasn't getting the support I wanted from the local party machine," said Lyken. "In a new party like Ukip it is much easier to make your way," said Nnorom. "When I came to Labour as a new person there was a blockage I could not get through."\par \par \uc2 The two men shared a stage with Nigel Farage last week at a rally where the Ukip leader laid claim to the ethnic minority vote despite one of the party's MEPs having described Africa as "bongo bongo land" last year, and a candidate telling Lenny Henry last month to "emigrate to a black country" if he wanted to see more black faces on TV.\par \par \uc2 They stood with around two dozen ethnic minority candidates as Farage declared: "Let this picture of me on the stage with all these men and women from all their different backgrounds be Ukip's clause IV moment".\par \par \uc2 Just as Tony Blair persuaded Labour to abandon its principle of nationalising industries in 1995, Ukip should not be seen as racist, he said.\par \par \uc2 But with one prominent supporter, Sanya-Jeet Thandi, leaving the party and telling the Guardian that the party is descending into a form of "racist populism", it seems Farage still has work to do to persuade others.\par \par \uc2 Nnorom said he had joined Ukip because Labour was wavering over a referendum on membership of the EU, which he thinks is heading towards "something like the Soviet Union in a capitalist context".\par \par \uc2 "For all of us that have settled here, this country has changed," he said. "When I came, before you gained your rights you had to struggle and you had to integrate and learn the values of the nation. Before it was open door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , the quality and value of Britishness was different. You open the border to a whole group of European nations who don't have the same values."\par \par \uc2 The impact of migration from eastern Europe on what he calls settled ethnic minorities is economic. He has found this argument chimes in Croydon, where more than 7,000 eastern Europeans live: "Black people in my area work in security and the care industries and they are being pushed out. There's a preference among employers to take the Polish or Lithuanian white person rather than the settled black person. There's always that preference. Out of the EU would be better for \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  "\par \par \uc2 In 2001, when Nnorom arrived in the UK, 70% of Croydon's population was white. By 2021 the council predicts the figure will be 40%. Among its suburban streets and tower blocks are 31,000 people from the Caribbean, 29,000 from Africa, 1,200 Tamils and similar numbers of Filipinos and Afghans, according to the 2011 census.\par \par \uc2 These people are hugely under represented in parliament, where only 4.2% of MPs are from ethnic minorities, but their votes will matter enormously in the tight council election on 22 May and the equally tight parliamentary fight next May. There are 37 Tory and 33 Labour members of \uc2 Croydon council\uc2 , and Barwell's majority at the last general election was 2,969.\par \par \uc2 "The current success Ukip is enjoying is a reaction to the way the UK is changing," said Barwell. "My experience is that most people care about the same stuff, rising standards, good schools. But is also the case that minorities have particular issues, say on foreign policy, health or \uc2 NHS\uc2  issues."\par \par \uc2 Barwell has had to tailor his stance on foreign policy issues such as Sri Lanka to account for his constituency's Tamil voters. "It is a massive challenge for political parties because there has been a hollowing out of political party membership, so they have become less well connected to communities," he said.\par \par \uc2 Barwell's Labour rival, Sarah Jones, said that Ukip's bid for the ethnic minority vote notwithstanding, her party should gain from an increasingly ethnically diverse electorate.\par \par \uc2 She insists Labour is taking nothing for granted and one or two voters have told her that they plan to switch from Labour to Ukip.\par \par \uc2 Jones said she was wary of treating different minority groups as a homogenous whole based on their background. "What defines people much more in society is the experience they are having right now in their lives," she said.\par \par \uc2 The emergence of Ukip's ethnic minority candidates has sparked accusations that they have been promoted by a calculating leadership to paper over xenophobia in other parts of the party, a claim Farage denies.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this week Lee Jasper, a race relations activist and senior Respect party member, branded the candidates "useful idiots" and several at the Farage rally were heckled as fakes by anti-Ukip activists.\par \par \uc2 Steven Woolfe, a Ukip candidate for the European parliament whose grandparents were black, Irish, English and Jewish, was one of those heckled. "It was upsetting to be called a fake and racist," he said. "Sadly, on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  such nasty claims still persist."\par \par \uc2 Nnorom and Lyken were among a group of ethnic minority Ukip candidates to sign a letter last week complaining many had "suffered the humiliation of being called Uncle Toms' or apologists for a racist party". They wrote: "We demand opponents no longer engage in physical or verbal abuse and support Ukip in fighting to rid politics of racism, discrimination and sectarianism."\par \par \uc2 14%\par \par \uc2 Proportion of the UK's population which is made up of ethnic minority groups.

Over the same period, the bottom 90% - a total of 27 million taxpayers - have seen their share of post-tax income fall from 71.3% to 70.4%, according to estimates contained in the latest Income Tax Liabilities Statistics published by HMRC. They cover the year when GDP growth returned and the top rate of income tax on earnings above pounds 150,000 was reduced from 50% to 45% .\par \par \uc2 Labour will use the figures to argue that there has been no recovery for middle Britain. \uc2 Chris Leslie\uc2 , shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: "What we need is a recovery for the many, not just a few at the top. That's why we need to reform our economy to mend the broken link between the wealth of the nation and the living standards of hardworking Britain."\par \par \uc2 The raft of labour market statistics published today will be studied to see how quickly unemployment is likely to fall below its pre-crisis levels. The rate in the three months to February stood at 6.9%, down sharply from a year ago but still well above its pre-crisis level of about 5%.\par \par \uc2 New \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  numbers are likely to show that as many as 30,000 extra Romanians and Bulgarians were working in the UK in the first three months of this year compared with the same period in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140513ea5e00099\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Caroline Aherne, the award winning actor and comedian, disclosed yesterday that she is recovering from treatment for lung cancer.\par \par \uc2 Aherne, who co-wrote, directed and starred in The Royle Family, revealed she has been undergoing treatment in her home city of Manchester. It is the 50-year-old's third battle with the disease, having been born with a rare form of retina cancer and later receiving treatment for bladder cancer.\par \par \uc2 She made the diagnosis public before her launch next month of the Macmillan Cancer Improvement Partnership, which will bring together all cancer care providers in Manchester with a view to improving support for cancer patients.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, she said: "I've had cancer and my brother's had cancer and we know how it affects people. It's brilliant that all these big institutions want to make cancer care better for Manchester people, but even the best doctors, nurses and managers on Earth aren't going to be able to understand what needs improving unless people affected by cancer in Manchester get involved and tell them what needs to change."\par \par \uc2 She continued: "They've asked me to get involved and I'm really glad that I can do my bit to encourage Manchester people to speak up about where things do go wrong with cancer care."\par \par \uc2 The daughter of Irish \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  Bert and Maureen, Aherne grew up on a council estate in Wythenshawe, in the south of Manchester, and her first job was answering telephones at BBC offices in the city. Her comedy creations have also included the spoof chatshow host Mrs Merton.\par \par \uc2 Both Aherne and her older brother Patrick were born with a rare form of retina cancer which she was treated for into her 20s. She then underwent treatment for bladder cancer, the same disease that later took the life of her boyfriend, Matt Bower, in 1997.\par \par \uc2 Aherne, who has been a smoker, has also spoken of her battles with depression and alcohol following the breakdown of her marriage to musician Peter Hook, the death of her father, and struggles with fame. She spent time at the Priory clinic before moving to Australia to escape the public eye.\par \par \uc2 She recently made her return to TV, however, as the narrator of the popular Channel 4 show Gogglebox. She said in her statement yesterday: "I will be narrating this week's Gogglebox, and I will continue to narrate Gogglebox for as long as Gogglebox want me."\par \par \uc2 Nicola Cook, of \uc2 Macmillan Cancer Support\uc2 , said she was delighted by Aherne's involvement in the new cancer partnership. "We know that its success hinges on the involvement of people affected by cancer in Manchester," she said.\par \par \uc2 "Caroline's one of Manchester's own - she's loved here and people identify with her. We hope that if people see that Caroline is sitting down and talking to us then maybe they'll know that they can too."\par \par \uc2 Caroline Aherne\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Caroline Aherne, currently narrator of Channel 4's Gogglebox, said she would continue with the show 'for as long as Gogglebox want me' Photograph: Empics\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140513ea5e0008w\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 'The party deliberately attracts the racist vote': Ukip poster girl tipped by Farage as 'rising star' quits over 'terrifying' lurch right\b0\par\par\uc2 JOHN STEVENS   \par \uc2 788 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2014\par 21:09\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

This week I decided to leave the party and I will abstain from voting in the upcoming European elections. I urge other Ukip supporters to do the same.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Ukip is exploiting the stupidity of ignorant anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  voters for electoral gain. While the party deliberately attracts the racist vote, I refuse to be associated with them.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Privately-educated Miss Thandi, who was previously chairman of its youth wing in London, specifically attacked one of its campaign posters for next week\u8217\'20\'19s elections, which reads: \u8216\'20\'1826 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18The poster epitomises where the party is going wrong,\u8217\'20\'19 she wrote in the blog post for the Guardian website.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18This anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  campaign undermines Ukip's claim not to be a racist party. They are turning the election into a game of "us" and "them". Well, I am with "them".\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Having worked so hard to help Ukip rid themselves of their "racist" label and denying comparisons to the BNP, this direction of campaigning really isn't doing my former colleagues any favours.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Miss Thandi's accusations come less than a week after Mr Farage appeared alongside of black and ethnic minority candidates at a rally in London, in an attempt to shake off claims Ukip is racist.\par \par \uc2 The London School of Economics anthropology student said that when she joined the party aged 17, \u8216\'20\'18there was none of this "they took our jobs" business\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 She added: \u8216\'20\'18Ukip is straying further and further from the policies that attracted so many of its original supporters, instead cynically pursuing ever more aggressive anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Ukip's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy, to me, was all about equality for every nationality; it was about treating Europeans and people outside the EU equally.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18But the recent racism scandals suggest, it seems, that most other Ukip voters and members support the policy \u8211\'20\'13 and the party \u8211\'20\'13 for a very different reason.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Previously fundamental policies like taxation and promoting a small state are being ignored in favour of going after the votes of those who think Lenny Henry "should emigrate to a black country".\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Miss Thandi, who grew up in Kent and was born to Punjabi parents, has been a prominent member of UKIP appearing in a party election broadcast last year and speaking twice at its annual conference.\par \par \uc2 Appearing in a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  video with Miss Thandi, Mr Farage said: \u8216\'20\'18Sanya, you\u8217\'20\'19re 18-years-old and you\u8217\'20\'19re a rising star in the party. At the conference you were the most popular speaker so I\u8217\'20\'19m going to have to watch my step, aren\u8217\'20\'19t I, as time goes on.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 In a newspaper interview, Miss Thandi described Mr Farage a 'a babe' and said Godfrey Bloom was \u8216\'20\'18cute and so kind and hilarious, he just says things for the reaction. Lovely guy but a bit misunderstood.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Ukip has been hit by a string of embarrassing comments from candidates in the last few weeks. One member who featured in the party\u8217\'20\'19s election broadcast was suspended after saying Ed Miliband was \u8216\'20\'18not a real Brit\u8217\'20\'19 and describing Islam as an \u8216\'20\'18evil organisation\u8217\'20\'19. Another supporter said Lenny Henry, the comedian, should emigrate to a \u8220\'20\'1Cblack country\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Appearing at a rally last week Mr Farage said that \u8216\'20\'18there will always be a few people who creep over the line and cause us embarrassment\u8217\'20\'19, but that the party did not welcome those with extremist or offensive views.\par \par \uc2 Standing on stage flanked by black and ethnic minority councillors and candidates, he said: \u8216\'20\'18From this moment on please do not ever call us a racist party. We are not a racist party.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140513ea5d0086h\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Family of former 'Wizard of Oz' Munchkin battles his ex-caretaker in court claiming he was extorted out of $500,000 before he died\b0\par\par\uc2 JAMES NYE   \par \uc2 1,071 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2014\par 17:06\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

Anderson got the munchkin actor to take out a $100,000 line of credit from a bank on his St. Louis house.\par \par \uc2 His family claimed that prior to this he was frugal and had no debts.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, five days after taking out his bank loan on January 22, 2009 bank records show that he began to sign checks made out to cash, with the first being for $42, 836.\par \par \uc2 Then two days after that he signed a check for $27,000 to cash and that same day, another one for $27,000.\par \par \uc2 Dodge, in an interview with the Post-Dispatch shortly after Carroll died on May 7, 2009, called allegations of missing money 'foolish.'\par \par \uc2 She said she became Carroll's caretaker in January 2009.\par \par \uc2 The suit says that 'at a minimum,' a total of $225,071 was embezzled from Carroll's account at Regions Bank.\par \par \uc2 Carroll's niece, Josephine Romeiser said her uncle was successful as a gravestone and monument maker after his Hollywood career ended.\par \par \uc2 'If you look up the word entertainer, that was my Uncle Mickey,' she said, according to St. Louis Today.\par \par \uc2 Carroll was one of more than 100 adults and children who were recruited to play the movie natives of what author L. Frank Baum called Munchkin Country in his 1900 book 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.'\par \par \uc2 Carroll told The Associated Press in a 2007 interview that the Munchkins made only $125 a week while filming the movie that would become a classic.\par \par \uc2 'The Wizard of Oz' was Carroll's only movie. When it appeared on television in the 1960s, he found a new career at charitable events, retail events and Oz-related events.\par \par \uc2 'It's not me; it's the movie,' Carroll said. 'When they see me, they think of their childhood, and it makes them smile.'\par \par \uc2 Carroll was born Michael Finocchiaro on July 8, 1919, in St. Louis. The son of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , he grew up in an Italian neighborhood on the city's north side with a twin sister and four older siblings. All preceded him in death.\par \par \uc2 A pituitary condition caused Carroll's short stature. Stephen Cox, a friend of Carroll's and the author of a book on the Munchkins, told the St.Louis Post-Dispatch that Carroll was 4-foot-3 when he stopped growing in his 40s.\par \par \uc2 Carroll danced at the Muny Theater in St. Louis when he was in grade school, he once said, and in the 1920s worked in Chicago clubs and on the Orpheum Theater vaudeville circuit.\par \par \uc2 His gift of gab and comedic timing helped his popularity. He warmed up crowds for President Franklin Roosevelt while campaigning in New York City and served as a crowd-getter in President Harry Truman's whistlestop campaign.\par \par \uc2 He did Phillip Morris live radio ads and appeared in shows with Mae West. He later did radio shows with George Burns, Gracie Allen, Jack Benny and Al Jolson.\par \par \uc2 But it was his role as one of the 'Oz' Munchkins that defined him.\par \par \uc2 Carroll played the part of the Munchkinland 'Town Crier,' marched as a 'Munchkin Soldier' and was the candy-striped 'Fiddler' who escorted the movie's wide-eyed orphan, Dorothy Gale, played by Judy Garland, down the yellow brick road toward Emerald City.\par \par \uc2 In the mid-1940s, Carroll returned to St. Louis to run the family business making cemetery monuments. After he sold it in 1996, he filled his time with charity work, Dodge said.\par \par \uc2 In November 2007, Carroll and six other surviving Munchkins received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\par \par \uc2 Carroll was joined on that occasion by former Munchkin colleagues Ruth Duccini, Jerry Maren, Margaret Pellegrini, Meinhardt Raabe, Karl Slover and Clarence Swensen. Swensen died in February.\par \par \uc2 At a special screening of the film in 2005 in Los Angeles, Carroll said talking to longtime fans about the movie brought back their childhoods.\par \par \uc2 'They have tears,' he said. 'I'll say, 'May the magic of Oz always be with you.' And, 'Follow the yellow brick road!' And they're all excited. I bring back their childhood. Ain't that something?'\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140513ea5d006pq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NEWS\par \b \uc2 Number of foreign nurses up 50pc in a year\b0\par\par\uc2 By Laura Donnelly and Peter Dominiczak   \par \uc2 1,178 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 May 2014\par 00:56\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 More than 5,000 nurses come to UK from EU, as \uc2 NHS\uc2  cuts training for home-grown staff\par \par \uc2 The number of foreign nurses coming to work in the UK from elsewhere in Europe has risen by 50 per cent in one year, following cuts in the numbers of nurses trained here, new figures show.\par \par \uc2 Nurse leaders and patients groups said \u8220\'20\'1Cshort-sighted\u8221\'20\'1D attempts to cut \uc2 NHS\uc2  spending had left desperate shortages on wards, leaving increasing numbers of hospitals to spend thousands of pounds recruiting staff from abroad.\par \par \uc2 New figures disclosed in response to a parliamentary question show that last year 5,217 nurses from EU countries outside the UK registered to work here - a rise of 51 per cent from the previous year, and the largest rise for more than a decade.\par \par \uc2 The surge follows cuts to \uc2 NHS\uc2  programmes to train nurses in this country, with 10,000 training places cut since 2010.\par \par \uc2 Over the past year, increasing numbers of hospitals have embarked on recruitment trawls abroad, in trips which have cost up to \u163\'00\'A310,000 at a time.\par \par \uc2 Last autumn a survey of more than 100 trusts found one in three had hunted abroad for nurses, and even more had drawn up plans to do so this year.\par \par \uc2 Hospitals targeted 29 different countries, with the highest number of nurses recruited from Portugal, followed by Spain and Ireland.\par \par \uc2 Under rules on freedom of labour, staff from the EU are able to register to work in this country without checks on their language or competence.\par \par \uc2 Regulators are not allowed to set tests, and research has found most hospitals do not carry out checks, despite Department of Health (DoH) advice that they should.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Royal College of Nursing (RCN) \uc2 on Tuesday said poor planning by \uc2 NHS\uc2  central bodies meant hospitals were paying heavily for \u8220\'20\'1Cquick fix\u8221\'20\'1D solutions to recruit from aboad.\par \par \uc2 Patients groups expressed concern that nurses were being recruited from abroad despite poor communication skills.\par \par \uc2 Katherine Murphy\uc2 , chief executive of the Patients Association said: \u8220\'20\'1CMany hundreds of nurses from other countries make a valuable and important contribution to healthcare in the UK. But the current situation is getting out of hand. Why are we cutting nurse training places when there is an acute shortage of nursing staff in the \uc2 NHS\uc2 ? \u8220\'20\'1C\par \par \uc2 Mrs Murphy called for \u8220\'20\'1Can urgent review\u8221\'20\'1D of the stituation, and said more rigour needed to be taken in recruiting nurses from overseas.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere are real issues with nurses from other countries including problems communicating with patients and a lack of understanding of processes and procedures,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. \u8220\'20\'1CPatients deserve to be treated by nurses who have been trained to the highest standards. If we do employ nurses from other countries, they need to be competent enough in English to effectively communicate with patients.\par \par \uc2 Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the RCN said: \u8220\'20\'1CCutting nurse training places is a short-sighted policy which ends up costing more as hospitals are forced to use short-term fixes such as overseas recruitment.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In 2009/10, 20,829 nurses were trained in England. Since then lower numbers have been trained each year, meaning that in total 10,000 fewer nurses have been trained, the parliamentary response shows.\par \par \uc2 Dr Carter said the continued trend meant \u8220\'20\'1Cthe worst is yet to come\u8221\'20\'1D with more gaps expected in the nursing workforce in coming years.\par \par \uc2 He said a recent step by \uc2 NHS\uc2  chiefs to increase training places was a \u8220\'20\'1Csmall step in the right direction.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Jamie Reed, shadow health minister, said: \u8220\'20\'1CWith youth unemployment so high, the Government should be bringing on the next generation of nurses. Instead, Ministers are cutting trainee nurse places at home and spending millions on overseas recruitment.\par \par \uc2 A Department of Health spokesman said: \u8220\'20\'1CThere are over 5,100 more nurses on our wards now than in 2010 and 1,000 extra adult nursing training places are being created this year. Nurses from abroad make a valuable contribution to the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and recruiting from abroad is nothing new. But local hospitals should only employ them if they have proven their competence and language skills.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The figures emerged as \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  warned that economic migrants fleeing failing eurozone countries like France and Spain are threatening Britain\u8217\'20\'19s bid to reduce \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron insisted his pledge to cut \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to below 100,000 by next year is still \u8220\'20\'1Cperfectly feasible\u8221\'20\'1D but admitted his Government has not reduced numbers \u8220\'20\'1Cas much as I\u8217\'20\'19d like\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 He blamed \uc2 European Union\uc2  countries with faltering economies for the spike in foreigners coming to the UK.\par \par \uc2 Figures to be released on Wednesday are expected to show that 30,000 \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  have come from Romania and Bulgaria alone since the start of the year.\par \par \uc2 Net migration soared to 212,000 last year.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think [the target] it is perfectly feasible,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Cameron told the Commons liaison committee. \u8220\'20\'1CWe have brought net migration into the UK down by a fifth under this Government \u8211\'20\'13 not as much as I\u8217\'20\'19d like.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe figures have been altered by the fact that in the last couple of years, because our economy has been growing more rapidly than the other European economies, we\u8217\'20\'19ve seen an increase in the number of people coming from EU countries to the United Kingdom.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron added: \u8220\'20\'1CSome of the biggest increases are actually from countries like Spain and Italy and France and the original EU members.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe target remains, the commitment remains. I want net migration to be down to the tens of thousands. I think it is absolutely achievable.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Figures from the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  in February showed a huge surge in the number of people coming to Britain from the EU countries which have been hardest hit by the economic crisis.\par \par \uc2 The number of Italians arriving in the UK last year rose 66 per cent to 44,000. Spain was up by 36 per cent to just under 52,000 and Portugal was up 47 per cent to 30,000 people.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron used his appearance before the MPs to reject claims that his Government\u8217\'20\'19s bid to cut \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has harmed UK universities.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister faced claims from MPs that foreign students have been put off applying to UK universities because of the crackdown on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The number of foreign students coming to the UK from India has decreased in recent years. Indian politicians have repeatedly blamed Conservative rhetoric over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  for the fall in numbers.\par \par \uc2 However, the Prime Minister accused people of \u8220\'20\'1Cpretending\u8221\'20\'1D that the focus on cutting net migration is \u8220\'20\'1Cinjuring our higher education system\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron said: \u8220\'20\'1CI profoundly believe you have \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  control and get the net migration numbers down at the same time as getting the best international students to come to Britain and the evidence shows that\u8217\'20\'19s exactly what\u8217\'20\'19s happening.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAnd so we must not throw out the success in getting net migration numbers down by pretending it\u8217\'20\'19s injuring our higher education system when it isn\u8217\'20\'19t.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140513ea5d007bz\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 PM: We've flopped on migrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By TOM NEWTON DUNN, Political Editor   \par \uc2 466 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2014\par 22:53\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd.

We are making progress, but it is extremely hard work".\par \par \uc2 But he rejected a call from some Tory MPs to strip students out of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  statistics, dubbing it as just "playing with the numbers".\par \par \uc2 As The Sun revealed last week, the next quarterly \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  statistics - released on May 22 - are expected to confirm the soaring number of EU \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  has now overtaken the number of arrivals from outside of the EU for the first time.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:t.newtondunn@the-sun.co.uk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 t.newtondunn@the-sun.co.uk}}}\par \par \uc2 Document THESUK0020140513ea5d005mu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

But its strong anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  message has made it a target for critics across the political establishment.\par \par \uc2 Ms Thandi, who is a student at the London School for Economics, appeared on Channel 4 recently to defend Ukip. She said then that Britain was implementing unfair \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rules by allowing in vast numbers of EU workers but clamping down on those from outside the EU, including highly skilled workers.\par \par \uc2 The student is the daughter of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from India and joined Ukip's youth wing in 2011 as a teenager because she backed its support for a smaller state and lower taxes.\par \par \uc2 She has appeared in public alongside Mr Farage several times, including a photo opportunity outside Downing Street. The Ukip leader he described her in 2011 as a "rising star".\par \par \uc2 But in an article in The Guardian Ms Thandi urged Ukip supporters to abstain from voting in next week's European elections.\par \par \uc2 "The direction in which the party is going is terrifying," she wrote. "Ukip has descended into a form of racist populism that I cannot bring myself to vote for. This week I decided to leave the party."\par \par \uc2 Ms Thandi said she had been alarmed by Ukip's poster with a large pointing finger alongside the words: "26m people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?"\par \par \uc2 She wrote: "The poster epitomises where the party is going wrong. This anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  campaign undermines Ukip's claim not to be a racist party. They are turning the election into a game of 'us' and 'them'. Well, I am with 'them'."\par \par \uc2 A party spokesman said he had not yet had time to read the article. "People join and leave political parties all the time, particularly young people," he said. "We're in the fortunate position of having more and more people join than leave."\par \par \uc2 Ukip's youth wing has about 2,000 members, according to officials.\par \par \uc2 Ms Thandi said the party was young but this was not an excuse to allow "racists" to stand for election.\par \par \uc2 "Nor is it an excuse to exploit the ignorance in British society and indulge the racist vote by telling them 'they'll take your jobs'. Sorry Ukip, you've lost another vote," she said.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140513ea5d004pi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 RBS makes preparations for Citizens' exit\b0\par\par\uc2 By Martin Arnold and Camilla Hall   \par \uc2 1,471 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2014\par 19:04\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2  has spent more than 25 years building \uc2 Citizens Financial Group\uc2  into the 13th-largest retail bank holding company in the US by assets through a string of acquisitions.\par \par \uc2 Now the \uc2 UK government\uc2 -controlled lender has two-and-a-half years to decide how to dispose of it. With little sign of serious interest from potential bidders, including the Canadian and Japanese banks that have expressed an interest, RBS late on Monday filed for an initial public offering.\par \par \uc2 Under the terms of its 2008 government bailout, the \uc2 European Union\uc2  has given RBS until the end of 2016 to sell Citizens, with a 12-month extension available if markets are unfavourable. It is expected to float a 20-25 per cent stake in the fourth quarter.\par \par \uc2 If Citizens' IPO totals at least $2.6bn, it would be the biggest listing of a US bank since before the financial crisis, according to data from Dealogic. \uc2 Ally Financial\uc2 , the US auto lender, sold $2.56bn of shares in April.\par \par \uc2 The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.\par \par \uc2 < >Most analysts, however, are convinced that RBS would prefer an outright sale of the Providence-based retail and commercial lender it acquired in 1988, which has 1,370 branches and 18,600 staff.\par \par \uc2 RBS has attracted interest from Japan's \uc2 Sumitomo\uc2  Mitsui as well as Canada's TD Bank. While talks continue with \uc2 Sumitomo\uc2 , TD Bank's interest is said to have faltered over price.\par \par \uc2 A quick, clean exit would allow RBS to shed Citizens' $100bn of risk-weighted assets overnight and boost its common equity tier one capital ratio of 9.4 per cent, which trails most rivals. But there are several reasons why a takeover seems unlikely.\par \par \uc2 < >Its IPO filing did not include a valuation, but analysts reckon Citizens is worth anywhere between its $13bn tangible book value and a 30 per cent premium to book value, or about $17bn. "I'm assuming it gets away at book value, and that is probably being generous," says Ian Gordon, banking analyst at Investec in London.\par \par \uc2 The regulatory environment for big financial acquisitions has toughened since the financial crisis, with worries over "too big to fail" institutions stymieing deal activity. "It's just a daunting challenge," says one financial institutions banker.\par \par \uc2 Even at book value, Citizens would be one of the biggest banking takeovers since the financial crisis. Analysts say it is too big for small regional banks to attempt to buy and the biggest US lenders, such as \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  and \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2 , would be prevented from doing so by the 10 per cent cap on national deposits.\par \par \uc2 Citizens - unlike its UK parent - is very well capitalised with a common equity tier one ratio of 13.5 per cent, well above most US rivals. It aims to return excess cash to its UK parent and started last year with a $1.2bn dividend, of which $1bn was paid in subordinated debt rather than cash.\par \par \uc2 This capital-reduction plan is a vital part of the US bank's strategy for boosting its return on tangible equity, which lags well behind rivals at less than 5 per cent. However, one problem is that Citizens was one of the banks that failed the US Federal Reserve's stress tests this year on a "qualitative basis".\par \par \uc2 People close to the bank say the Fed will allow Citizens to repeat last year's dividend plan. But it warns in its IPO filing that because of regulatory scrutiny of its capital, it "may not able to consummate the capital initiatives".\par \par \uc2 One of the biggest hurdles for the underwriters on its IPO - \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  and \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  - is to convince investors that Citizens is a bank worth owning, because of its weak performance. Including a $4.4bn goodwill writedown, Citizens made a $3.4bn net loss last year.\par \par \uc2 Its cost-income ratio - a measure of its efficiency - was above most rivals at almost 70 per cent. But its net interest margin - the difference between the interest it earns from loans and what it pays on deposits - was below most rivals at 2.85 per cent.\par \par \uc2 "As the competition for loan growth heats up, the smaller banks are probably at a disadvantage because they don't have the scale and diversity that the larger banks do," says \uc2 Jennifer Thompson\uc2 , an analyst at \uc2 Portales Partners\uc2  in New York.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, banks that fail the Fed's stress tests are likely to face additional costs to meet the demands of the US central bank. The merger of \uc2 M&T Bank\uc2  and \uc2 Hudson City Bancorp\uc2 , two US regional lenders, has been on hold since 2012 after US regulators objected to \uc2 M&T\uc2 's anti-money laundering processes.\par \par \uc2 One US private equity executive, who has run the ruler over Citizens, says: "It is a roll-up of mediocre banks in a lot of mediocre markets."\par \par \uc2 An added incentive to seek an outright sale is that \uc2 Bruce van Saun\uc2 , who took over as chief executive of Citizens in October 2013, could receive a payout of more than $12m if the business was sold rather than floated.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock and Arash Massoudi\par \par \uc2 Citizens: the history of a New England bank\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2  acquired \uc2 Citizens Financial\uc2  in 1988 the Edinburgh-based bank hailed it as "the flagship for the company's expansion in the US". Now RBS's decision to launch an initial public offering of Citizens' shares symbolises the Edinburgh-based bank's need to retrench in a very different economic and political climate, writes Sarah Neville in London.\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF The bank began life back in 1828 in Providence, Rhode Island, at the time a pre-eminent industrial centre and seaport, and in 1871 established its own savings bank, Citizens Savings Bank.\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF The Great Depression of the 1930s hit New England hard but the bank's losses were relatively modest compared with some rivals.\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF By the 1940s, Citizens Savings Bank had gained a controlling interest in its founder, High Street Bank, and in 1948 it changed its name to \uc2 Citizens Trust Company\uc2 . It continued to grow in the decades that followed and by 1981 Citizens had 29 branches statewide.\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF Seeking an international partner, Citizens became a wholly owned subsidiary of \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2  group in 1988. It has since undergone a big growth spurt with 30 acquisitions between 1988 and 2007.\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF In the 21st century the bank has completed an evolution from the fifth-largest bank in the smallest state in the US to its position today as one of the 15 largest commercial banking companies in the country.\par \par \uc2 Profile: Fish, the man who built Citizens\par \par \uc2 He may have retired five years ago, but if a single figure epitomises \uc2 Citizens Financial\uc2 's growth into a substantial player on the US banking scene it is Lawrence "Larry" Fish, writes Sarah Neville in London.\par \par \uc2 In 1988, Mr Fish was its hard-charging chief executive officer when RBS decided to swoop, after identifying Citizens as the bridgehead that would take it into the American market.\par \par \uc2 Within four years he had become chairman, leading from the front as the bank went on a buying spree, swallowing smaller rivals.\par \par \uc2 By 2005, Mr Fish had established himself as a key lieutenant of \uc2 Fred Goodwin\uc2 , RBS's later-disgraced chief executive, who picked him to help restructure RBS's American businesses into a single unit.\par \par \uc2 When Mr Fish stepped down in 2009, controversy swirled over the size of his annual pension - at around \u163\'00\'A31.4m, it was twice that originally accorded to Mr Goodwin.\par \par \uc2 His annual pay also left the RBS chief executive's in the shade: in 2006, it stood at \u163\'00\'A36.59m, compared with the \u163\'00\'A33.99m netted by Mr Goodwin.\par \par \uc2 Educated at \uc2 Drake University\uc2 , from where he graduated in 1966, Mr Fish received an MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in 1968. He was awarded Harvard's prestigious Frank Knox Fellowship, which included graduate study at the London School of Economics and travel in India.\par \par \uc2 In retirement he continues to pursue philanthropic interests in \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and urban poverty, volunteering at inner-city organisations in Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, where Citizens was founded.\par \par \uc2 Together with his Japanese-born wife, Atsuko Toko Fish, he established the Fish Family Foundation to support organisations focusing on low-income working families, with a particular focus on \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and women.\par \par \uc2 He has been a prominent backer of US president Barack Obama, and in 2012 spoke out against advertisements - by either side - that employed "character assassination or negative campaigning".\par \par \uc2 Mr Fish has received honorary doctorate degrees from Providence College, Bryant University, Roger Williams University, Johnson & Wales University and the University of Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140513ea5d004mr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Ukip's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy, to me, was all about equality for every nationality; it was about treating Europeans and people outside the EU equally.\par \par \uc2 "But the recent racism scandals suggest, it seems, that most other Ukip voters and members support the policy \u8211\'20\'13 and the party \u8211\'20\'13 for a very different reason.\par \par \uc2 Miss Thandi specifically attacked one of Ukip's campaign posters, which reads: "26 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?"\par \par \uc2 She said: "The poster epitomises where the party is going wrong. This anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  campaign undermines Ukip's claim not to be a racist party. They are turning the election into a game of 'us' and 'them'.\par \par \uc2 "Well, I am with 'them'.\par \par \uc2 "Having worked so hard to help Ukip rid themselves of their "racist" label and denying comparisons to the BNP, this direction of campaigning really isn't doing my former colleagues any favours.\par \par \uc2 "I understand that British politics in the 21st century has become a dirty game of populism, but Ukip is straying further and further from the policies that attracted so many of its original supporters, instead cynically pursuing ever more aggressive anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  rhetoric."\par \par \uc2 The Ukip election poster which has attracted criticism [PA]\par \par \uc2 Miss Thandi, in an article for the Guardian website, also accused Ukip of abandoning its ambitions for "lower taxes, a smaller state, freedom of the individual, local referenda, and an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy that offered fair and equal opportunities for everyone."\par \par \uc2 She said: "I am the daughter of Indian nationals and strongly support \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . According to the \uc2 Adam Smith Institute\uc2 , GDP could more than double with the free movement of labour. There's no denying \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is a positive thing.\par \par \uc2 "Yet if I voted Ukip, how many of those voting with me would privately prefer that my parents and I were not citizens of this country?"\par \par \uc2 At the meeting in London last week, Mr Farage acknowledged comments by a number of the party's candidates had caused embarrassment - including one candidate which tweeted that comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a "black country" and compared Islam to the Third Reich.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said such comments had been wrongly held up by the media as representing the views of the party as a whole.\par \par \uc2 "There will always be in any system a few people who creep over the line and cause us embarrassment. I would rather the 10 people - out of 2,234 - who said things that are either stupid or offensive in some case - I'd rather it hadn't happened," he said.\par \par \uc2 "The result of this has been huge sections of the British media defended their friends in the so-called main parties and the offensive, idiotic statements made by this handful of people have been lifted up and presented to the Great British public as if they represent the view of this party, which they do not.\par \par \uc2 "They never have and they never will."\par \par \uc2 Ukip has yet to issue any comment on Miss Thandi's accusations.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140513ea5d002xl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Sanya-Jeet Thandi, who defended her support of Ukip on Channel 4 News, says the party is now appealing to 'stupidity of ignorant anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  voters for electoral gain'\par \par \uc2 A British Asian leader of Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s youth wing has quit the party, branding it \u8220\'20\'1Cracist\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1Cterrifying\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Sanya-Jeet Thandi, who had been introduced at Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s party conference as a future leader, said the party has abandoned its core supporters and now appealed to the \u8220\'20\'1Cstupidity of ignorant anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  voters for electoral gain\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Miss Thandi appeared on Channel 4 News this week to defend her membership but has now {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/13/ukip-playing-race-card-im-quitting-the-party"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 quit the party}}}\uc2  and is calling on other Ukip supporters to boycott the upcoming European and local elections.\par \par \uc2 Miss Thandi, who joined Ukip at 17 as events co-ordinator of the youth wing and spoke at the party conference, said new Ukip posters pointing the finger at \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  \u8220\'20\'1Cepitomise\u8221\'20\'1D what has gone wrong with the party.\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage has recently sought to rid Ukip of its racist image by appearing at a rally flanked by 40 ethnic minority supporters. At an event in London, he said: \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t care what you call us, but from this moment on, please do not call us a racist party.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 However, the strategy, Ms Thandi said, is not \u8220\'20\'1Cgood enough" to reverse the \u8220\'20\'1Cform of racist populism\u8221\'20\'1D that had developed in the party over the last three years.\par \par \uc2 Over the last few weeks a string of Ukip candidates have been exposed as harbouring racist views. Andre Lampitt, who featured in the party\u8217\'20\'19s election broadcast, was suspended after saying Ed Miliband was \u8220\'20\'1Cnot a real Brit\u8221\'20\'1D and describing Islam as an \u8220\'20\'1Cevil organisation\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Another supporter said Lenny Henry, the comedian, should emigrate to a \u8220\'20\'1Cblack country\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said people with \u8220\'20\'1Coffensive and idiotic\u8221\'20\'1D views had managed to join the party, despite his efforts to vet candidates and imposing a ban on former BNP and National Front members.\par \par \uc2 Ms Thandi, a privately-educated London School of Economics student born to Punjabi parents, joined Ukip because she said David Cameron was \u8220\'20\'1Cgoing soft\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Three years ago, she agreed with Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s policy on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  because current policy favoured Eueopeans over other migrants when her grandparents had to \u8220\'20\'1Cwork so hard\u8221\'20\'1D to come to England, she said.\par \par \uc2 Miss Thandi, who grew up in Kent, became one of Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s biggest cheerleaders, telling The Times that Mr Farage was \u8220\'20\'1Ca babe\u8221\'20\'1D and describing Godfrey Bloom as \u8220\'20\'1Ccute and so kind and hilarious, he just says things for the reaction. Lovely guy but a bit misunderstood".\par \par \uc2 However, announcing her resignation on The Guardian website Miss Thandi said people with \u8220\'20\'1Cracist views\u8221\'20\'1D had now been slipping through Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s checks \u8220\'20\'1Ctime and time again\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 She wrote: \u8220\'20\'1CIn order to convince society they are not racist they need to stop giving positions in the party to people with racist views.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is not good enough to say that these individuals just slipped through the net, time and time again. Yes, Ukip is still a relatively young party.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNo, that is not an excuse to allow racists to stand for election. Nor is it an excuse to exploit the ignorance in British society and indulge the racist vote by telling them 'they'll take your jobs'."\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140513ea5d005hc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Features Pages\par \b \uc2 G2: The Muslims are here!: Halal meat is now on every menu; sharia law is hijacking our justice system; the niqab is undermining the nation. Ever noticed how often the same old stories about Muslims in Britain keep appearing? Yet where is the real evidence for all these threats? Nesrine Malik sorts fact from fiction\b0\par\par\uc2 Nesrine Malik   \par \uc2 1,947 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In Britain, there is now a cycle of Islamic scare stories so regular that it is almost comforting, like the changing of the seasons. Sadly, this rotation is not as natural, or as benign, although it is beginning to feel just as inevitable. We had the niqab winter last year, as the country lurched into the niqab debate for the second time in three years. Now we are in the spring of halal slaughter.\par \par \uc2 Add to this schedule the routine reports about gender segregation in UK universities and Muslim schools (as if the concept of gender segregation was somehow exotic to non-faith schools in the UK), claims of grand plans to "overthrow" non-Muslim heads of certain schools and you have a steady flow of creeping sharia messages, stoking a fear of a stealthy, incremental Islamicisation.\par \par \uc2 Channel 4's Ramadan coverage last year drew 2,011 complaints, the majority objecting to the broadcast of the call to prayer, a two-minute transmission. This reflects an increasing nationwide umbrage towards visible British Muslims, informed by repetitive stories that inaccurately amplify their religiously motivated activity.\par \par \uc2 Underpinning it is a common theme: that there is an ever more muscular and intimidating Muslim minority demanding special rights from a cowed and pandering, lily-livered body politic muzzled by "multicultural Britain" - rather than simply attempting to adapt and integrate, as \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  of all religions have been doing in the UK for centuries. It's not hard to see how this constant blurring of facts generates the mood music of anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rightwingers and establishes common misconceptions about Muslims.\par \par \uc2 But the threat of a creeping sharia never seems to materialise. It seems to be more of a crawling sharia, so slowly has the Islamist takeover of Britain been, in contrast to the constant media warnings of its imminent arrival.\par \par \uc2 The focus far outstrips the size and political activity of the minority, which number 2.7 million (less than 5% of the population), not all of whom are practising Muslims. The Islamic scare story plays to a nexus of easy media sensationalism, a portion of the public primed and ready to believe the worst, and an interested rightwing element for whom it is a convenient vehicle for their anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  views, xenophobia, or just Islamophobia.\par \par \uc2 But with each reincarnation of a creeping Islamic threat, the gulf between the facts and what is reported widens. The following are some of the most popular examples - and the facts that discredit them.\par \par \uc2 The niqab\par \par \uc2 One of the most helpful exercises is to present some estimation of how many women actually wear the niqab, the face veil, in any given European country in which there is controversy about it. The estimates are so small that they cool a usually heated debate. In France, which banned them in public in 2011, it is estimated as between 400 and 2,000, ie not even 0.1% of the population. In the UK, approximations suggest that the numbers are "extremely low". Among practising Muslim women, niqab wearers are more of a minority than women who do not even wear the hijab, the head scarf. You are far more likely in the UK to meet a Muslim woman in jeans and a T-shirt than you are to meet one in a niqab. It seems embarrassing that politicians and media professional should dedicate so much time to agonising over the issue.\par \par \uc2 Politicians are the worst culprits for recycling the niqab debate. Philip Hollobone, a member of parliament, was so moved by the plight of women in niqabs that he proposed to ban them from his constituency office. Security concerns over ID and testifying in court are utterly unfounded: women are required to take off their niqabs for identification purposes - for drivers' licences etc - and they overwhelmingly comply. Once the security concerns are dispensed with, the last retreat of the niqab botherers is that the debate is out of anxiety for these women. But there has not yet been a single incident where the niqab debate was instigated by Muslim women themselves.\par \par \uc2 Muslim grooming gangs\par \par \uc2 In 2012, nine men were convicted of child exploitation and grooming of vulnerable young girls in Rochdale. Similar grooming gangs were identified in Derby, Rotherham and Oxford. Rather than the colour or religion of the assailant being incidental to the crime - which is taken for granted when they are white or Christian - the fact that these grooming gangs were Asian and Muslim, and their victims white, became central to their offences in public discourse and media coverage. How was this done? Newspaper articles, radio shows and TV panel discussions adopted, discussed and repeated the claim of Muslim grooming and abuse. By popularising a notion that their crimes were somehow mandated by a sharia law that condoned sexual exploitation of non-Muslims. That is, not only is their religion relevant, it is blessing their crimes, or at least informing their culture. This was simply not true but it was repeated and sublimated into fact. Rod Liddle in the Spectator approached this pivotal point, the purported reasoning for the entire grooming phenomenon, by saying: "Is there something within the religion or ideology of Islam which somehow encourages, or merely facilitates, extremist Muslim maniacs to maim or kill non-Muslims? I think there probably is. But you can't say that."\par \par \uc2 There you have it. He thinks there probably is. Never mind reports that Muslim girls were abused as well. Conveniently, this worldview chimes with the politically correct liberal somewhere out there who would rather your daughters were sexually groomed than dare call something out as related to religion.\par \par \uc2 Since Operation Yewtree started, there has been a healthy debate about sexism in the UK - the impunity of male celebrities, the cultural tolerance of sexual activity with minors and so on. But this nuance was not applied to the "Muslim grooming gangs", a description about as unhelpful as the "Christian paedophile Jimmy Savile". It was a scenario in which a factually erroneous religious justification was used to explain an anomalous episode.\par \par \uc2 Sharia courts\par \par \uc2 There have been two recent flare-ups of the sharia courts and "parallel Islamic law" scare story. In 2011, a bill was tabled in parliament to address concerns over sharia arbitration, and in early 2014 solicitors were allowed to draw up sharia-compliant wills, leading the Sunday Telegraph to pronounce that "Islamic law is adopted by British legal chiefs".\par \par \uc2 Since 2009, there have been sharia court investigations by the Independent, the Telegraph and the BBC. The political momentum against these courts is primarily from Baroness Cox, a crossbench member of the House of Lords and self-proclaimed "voice of the voiceless" Muslim women, who she claims are being victimised.\par \par \uc2 Of all the Muslim threats, this seems the most potent. It actually has "sharia" in the name. UK law has some scope to acknowledge the customary or religious laws of both Jews and Muslims. But going by the coverage, it would seem it is only Muslims that have both demanded and been granted exception. On closer inspection, it is clear sharia courts only have jurisdiction on civil matters and everyone must opt in to a sharia court. They only have an advisory capacity and address mainly property and financial matters, and rulings are then only enforceable by civil courts. In many cases, they are understaffed affairs, where one official settles petty disputes and draws up rudimentary documents.\par \par \uc2 The creeping sharia courts' "astonishing spread" was first reported by the Daily Mail in 2009. At the time, there were reportedly "no fewer than 85". In the most recent Daily Mail report on the issue in 2014, the number was, despite the warning about the pace of change whereby Islamic law was cannibalising British secular law, still "no fewer than 85".\par \par \uc2 Islamic banking\par \par \uc2 The most recent episode of this was a report that \uc2 Lloyds TSB\uc2  in the UK had reduced or eliminated overdraft fees on its Islamic bank accounts. This apparently "special treatment" might suggest that banks are overturning their commercial interests to keep customers happy. This alone should be a clear alert that the story is bunkum. When have you known a bank to do that? The reality is that Islamic bank accounts are, in fact, on average more costly for customers. Interest rates (yes, they are charged on Islamic bank accounts, under different mechanisms, usually fixed transaction fees) are often higher than the secular high street. More crucially, as Lloyds itself has explained, Islamic accounts "do not offer credit interest or other features that are available on our other products. A comparison with the overdraft charging structure on other accounts is meaningless." The question shouldn't have been, "Want to avoid overdraft fees? Open an Islamic bank account", but: "Want to avoid overdraft fees? Open an Islamic bank account where you will not receive any interest on savings or deposits." Again, this is a recycled story from 2009, so it is not an expose.\par \par \uc2 Halal slaughter\par \par \uc2 According to recent tabloid newspaper "revelations", halal meat is being slipped into food at major supermarkets, and Pizza Express has been "exposed" for stealthily replacing its chicken supply with halal poultry. Halal meat must come from animals that were killed with a cut to the throat, allowing all the blood to drain from the carcass. In the past four years, the UK media has broken the story to the British public at least a dozen times, warning about the widespread use of halal meat, yet somehow every new headline presents it as a new finding. In the latest Pizza Express episode, where the claim was that the chain was surreptitiously slipping halal chicken on to its menu, there was no secrecy at all: the chain's website clearly states it uses halal chicken.\par \par \uc2 The "secret" element, a popular angle in the halal story, serves to support the alarm that people are being hoodwinked by Muslims sneaking their way of life into the mainstream.\par \par \uc2 The supposed objection is that halal slaughter is a less humane method of terminating an animal than the supposedly more palatable methods of stunning, electrocution and gassing. But according to a 2012 Food Standards Agency report cited by the \uc2 RSPCA\uc2 , 97% of cattle, 96% of poultry and 90% of sheep slaughtered using the halal method in UK abattoirs are stunned first, desensitising the animal to pain. If the objection were really about the distress of slaughter, it would therefore apply to only a tiny proportion of halal meat.\par \par \uc2 The most recycled of stories, the halal debate began in earnest in 2003, with a \uc2 Farm Animal Welfare Council\uc2  report that recommended stunning for halal and kosher slaughter. Since then, every time the issue of religiously compliant slaughter has been resurrected, the kosher element has been less and less prominent, rendering it less an animal rights issue, and more an irrational rejection of halal slaughter as something tainted with something intangibly Muslim. In a nation that has been enjoying halal meat for years in curries, kebabs and shawarmas, the halal debate has distorted and hijacked the welfare dimension, in order to channel nasty resentment that a minority you don't like is being accommodated.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Fact or fiction?\par \par \uc2 'Shocking stories' from the Daily Star, Daily Express, the Sun and Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Scare stories\par \par \uc2 More Muslim 'news' from the Daily Mail and the Sun\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140513ea5d0000x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Front: Tories on top as Labour poll rating sinks to four-year low: Ukip surge adds to Miliband camp's nerves ahead of European and local votes\b0\par\par\uc2 Tom Clark   \par \uc2 1,174 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Labour's support is draining away, according to a Guardian/ICM poll which records the first Conservative lead in more than two years and gives Ed Miliband's party its smallest share of the vote for four years.\par \par \uc2 The Tories are on 33% in the monthly state of the parties poll, up a single point and two points ahead of Labour, which has sunk by six points since April. The poll will add to Labour nerves a week and a half before European and local elections, and less than a year before the general election.\par \par \uc2 It is the first time since March 2012 that the Conservatives have registered a lead over Labour in the Guardian/ICM poll.\par \par \uc2 Flush with publicity of all kinds before the European ballot, Nigel Farage's Ukip climbs four points to 15%. The Liberal Democrats edge up one to 13%. The ICM finding is surprising because although polling averages have pointed towards a narrowing gap between the two main parties, internet polls for the Sunday papers pointed to continuing Labour leads of between four and seven points.\par \par \uc2 However, a second telephone poll published yesterday, sponsored by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft, also points to a two-point Conservative lead. That poll has the Tories on 34% against Labour's 32%.\par \par \uc2 Haunted by memories of the Thatcher/Major years, when healthy opposition leads during mid-term repeatedly disappeared in the runup to polling day, Labour has long feared that Miliband's edge may not be big enough to take the party safely into power next May.\par \par \uc2 As a nervous Labour party seeks an explanation for its dwindling ratings, it may take some comfort from the fact that the Tories have barely advanced. However, with Europe, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and an improving economy in the spotlight, the party will now be wondering whether it faces an even stiffer task in persuading an uncertain country to entrust it again with the levers of power.\par \par \uc2 Labour's low ebb in the Guardian/ICM poll goes hand in hand with negative views of its leader. Despite a month in which Miliband has put regulation of rental agreements on the agenda, and made the running against the government over \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2 , 51% of voters believe he is doing a bad job, twice as many as the 26% who think he is doing well, giving him a net negative rating of -25.\par \par \uc2 This is the worst score for him that ICM has recorded on this occasional question, although it is only marginally worse than the net -22 he notched up when it was last asked, a year ago.\par \par \uc2 What has changed since then is where this leaves Miliband in relation to other political leaders. Nick Clegg remains comparably unpopular, with 51% also believing him to be doing badly and just 30% rating him as doing a good job.\par \par \uc2 But whereas \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  were also in negative territory last spring, after a year in which the economic recovery has picked up pace their standing is now much improved.\par \par \uc2 Some 44% of voters think the prime minister is doing a good job, against 42% who say the reverse. That gives him a net rating of +2, which compares with -15 last May.\par \par \uc2 The bounceback in Osborne's stock is more dramatic. After the "omnishambles" budget of 2012, his net score was -25, and in April 2013, when the question was last asked of the chancellor, it was -14.\par \par \uc2 But in the latest poll, 41% of respondents tell ICM that he is doing a good job, against just 36% who regard him as doing badly, which gives him a net +5.\par \par \uc2 ICM's monthly phone survey is best interpreted in the light of wider trends. Labour opened up a clear lead during the first half of 2012, after Andrew Lansley's \uc2 NHS\uc2  reforms and more particularly after that unpopular budget.\par \par \uc2 Ukip is now within three points of the 18% it notched up a year ago, in its best ever score with ICM. Curiously, however, the party's resurgence comes alongside flagging enthusiasm for Farage.\par \par \uc2 In May last year his job approval rating was +17. Today, 39% say he is doing a bad job as against 31% who see him as doing well, giving him a negative net rating of -8.\par \par \uc2 Among Lib Dem voters his score is -20, among Labour supporters -28, and even among Conservatives he notches up -11. By contrast, among his own tribe, his popularity is overwhelming: 93% of Ukip backers believe Farage is doing well, suggesting support for the man is translating into support for the party.\par \par \uc2 Clegg just scores in positive territory among current Conservatives, a contrast with 2010 Lib Dem voters, who now believe the man they supported last time around is doing a bad job, by 44% to 40%.\par \par \uc2 Miliband can draw some comfort from the narrow majority of current Labour voters, 52%, who believe that he is doing well, although - after Labour's "incredible shrinking man" broadcast assaulting Clegg - he will be disappointed that 54% of 2010 Lib Dems rate him as doing badly.\par \par \uc2 ICM also asked more specifically about voting intentions for next week's European elections. With only 37% of electors suggesting they are certain to cast their ballot, such projections inescapably depend on fewer respondents than those for Westminster.\par \par \uc2 Even so, the news is again encouraging for the Conservatives, and worrying for Labour.\par \par \uc2 The Tories are up two on April, which puts them on 27%, and in a virtual dead heat with Ukip, which has bounced up four in the European stakes to stand at 26%. Labour sinks by 12 points on April, to 24%, with appreciable proportions of the party's 2010 votes moving to Ukip and the Greens.\par \par \uc2 Together with Lib Dem defectors -Clegg's party languishes on 7% - this helps push the Greens up four and into a clear fourth place, on 10%. The Scottish and Welsh nationalists are on 2% each, and assorted independents and others notch up 3%.\par \par \uc2 Voters across the United Kingdom will elect 73 members of the European parliament next week. There are also local council elections for 4,200 seats in 161 councils and direct elections for mayors in four London boroughs. Labour is looking to reach at least 35% in the council elections. The polls are the last major test of public opinion before the general election, which is set for 7 May 2015.\par \par \uc2 ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,000 adults aged 18+ by telephone on 9-11 May 2014. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  takes a selfie with local people in Harrow, north-west London, yesterday Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140513ea5d0000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 William has taken on his mother's mission \u8212\'20\'14 I look forward to meeting him\b0\par\par\uc2 Rosamund Urwin   \par \uc2 1,348 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2014\par \uc2 London Evening Standard\par \uc2 NS\par \uc2 1; National\par 20,21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited   \par \par \uc2 Tonight the Duke of Cambridge will host a party to celebrate the new Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research. The designer tells Rosamund Urwin why London is so special to him\par \par \uc2 TONIGHT, Windsor Castle is home to a transatlanctic tie-up \u8212\'20\'14 a joint venture between British royalty and American fashion royalty. The Duke of Cambridge is hosting a charity gala in aid of the Royal Marsden Hospital, where he is president, with the event sponsored by long-term donor Ralph Lauren. Names on the starriest of guest lists include Benedict Cumberbatch, Cara Delevingne, Kate Moss and Cate Blanchett. And as the Evening Standard can reveal, they will all be celebrating the opening of the Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research at the hospital.\par \par \uc2 Chasing a cancer cure has been Lauren's philanthropic mission for almost a quarter of a century. His crusade began after a fashion editor friend, Nina Hyde, was struck down by breast cancer in 1990.\par \par \uc2 "In the beginning, I just wanted to help her," Lauren tells me in his gravelly voice. "I had had a brain tumour [which turned out to be benign] and I had the sense that because I was okay, I had some kind of magic \u8212\'20\'14 I eventually found I didn't. It wasn't a matter of creating a legacy for her, it was a matter of wanting her to live."\par \par \uc2 Hyde asked him to encourage the fashion industry to raise the profile of breast cancer. "I was involved because of her," Lauren explains. "And [after she died], I thought: 'What else can I do?' I do this out of passion. I still don't feel like I'm doing as much as I can, though: I feel there's more to come."\par \par \uc2 The designer \u8212\'20\'14 who looks dapper in a grey pinstripe suit and matching thin tie \u8212\'20\'14 is talking to me in the Royal Marsden's boardroom. We've just been shown the hospital's newest technology: the CyberKnife. It's a radiotherapy machine that can target tumours with highly concentrated radiation beams using a robotic arm. Walking into the room \u8212\'20\'14 a lead-lined space with a steel ceiling and the heaviest of doors \u8212\'20\'14 does feel like stepping into a hospital from a sci-fi novel. Lauren has long been impressed by the Marsden, though: "It has a reputation as a major research hospital, but it's also involved in the emotional care of the patients. Research is research all over the world, but this is a very connected hospital."\par \par \uc2 Lauren has given to a number of cancer cure units in the US, and even set one up in Harlem 11 years ago. The Bronx-born son of Belarusian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  may be the richest man in fashion (Forbes estimates his net worth at $6.8billion) but he has personal experience of the inequality of the US health system \u8212\'20\'14 hence his choice of Harlem.\par \par \uc2 "A doctor told me that a lot of [cancer] deaths are because of the person's economic situation," he says. "People are afraid to go to the doctor if they don't have the money. My mother once found a lump in her breast and was terrified that she might have to have an operation. She might have died just from the scare." Fortunately, his mother went on to live a long life.\par \par \uc2 Lauren is a charmer \u8212\'20\'14 his eyes really do twinkle and a perpetual smile shows off his toothpaste ad teeth. He's 74 now, and his skin hints at a few too many summers in the Hamptons sun, but he's so sprightly he'd put most twentysomethings to shame. "I don't even know what my age is," he laughs. "But I think I'm 26."\par \par \uc2 But while he's old enough to admit he doesn't much enjoy partying any more, he's clearly thrilled about the royal connection with tonight's event. Lauren knew Princess Diana, who was once president of the hospital, thanks to both their efforts to fight cancer. Tonight will be the first time he meets William, though: "I'm looking forward to it. He's taken up his mother's movement. Tonight's not a fashion moment as far as I'm concerned; it's a moment of connection."\par \par \uc2 ALTHOUGH the Duchess of Cambridge won't be attending, she has worn his clothes (there's a blazer she seems particularly enamoured of ) and inspires a Lauren panegyric: "Everyone loves her in the US. She's got a charming way about her and she's very beautiful. I think she's doing her job \u8212\'20\'14 as the Prince's wife and mother of the future King \u8212\'20\'14 perfectly. And the Prince comes across as a good guy \u8212\'20\'14 they seem like a couple you'd want to talk to \u8212\'20\'14 real people. Although you'll have to ask me again later..."\par \par \uc2 This is a rare visit to the UK, but Lauren loves London. "In the early part of my career, the men's clothes were very inspired by England so I've always had a special passion for it. It's a very masculine town. I always think Paris is for girls, London is for boys. It's changed a lot since I was last here, though \u8212\'20\'14 I see an energy now that's really terrific." He's such an Anglophile, he raves about Downton Abbey and Mr Selfridge: "It's the era and charm \u8212\'20\'14 I love them."\par \par \uc2 The Marsden opening isn't his only upcoming celebration: he'll soon also be marking 50 years of marriage to his wife, Ricky. She accompanies him to the Marsden, and they really seem like a dream team, with a sweet, jokey atmosphere between the two. When I ask how their relationship remains so strong, Lauren can't resist a quip: "My wife's very smart and beautiful. If she weren't so beautiful, I don't think I would have hung around that long."\par \par \uc2 The pair have three children: Dylan, a woman Willy Wonka with a chain of sweetshops; Andrew, a film-maker; and David, who followed his father into the family business: "Time passes very quickly. You're married, then all of a sudden you have three kids, and then suddenly one of the kids is walking around telling you what to do."\par \par \uc2 It strikes me that Lauren Senior doesn't need much bossing around. This is a man who's made it from the Bronx to the Billionaires' list via Bloomingdales. He planned to be a teacher and never went to fashion school, yet had the confidence to quit selling ties at 26 to design them. "[When selling] I'd make suggestions and they'd say 'the world's not ready for Ralph Lauren'. What did they know?' I quit because I felt I had something to say. It was right after the Mod movement \u8212\'20\'14 I started just as it died out, and my ties were elegant and unusual."\par \par \uc2 Shirts soon followed and later women's clothes and children's clothes. Although Lauren admits there were times he feared he'd go under, his empire now has a market capitalisation of more than $13 billion. And he remains heavily involved: "I work very hard to design the products. I have a team of people but it's not like I'm floating around \u8212\'20\'14 I'm working, I'm part of it. And it's fun."\par \par \uc2 I ask if it is difficult to remain relevant as a septuagenarian in an industry fixated on youth. He points to a shrinking gap between the generations: "It's easier to stay connected today. I think I'm at the best spot I've ever been. I'm not trailing and I'm not just there \u8212\'20\'14 I'm current." Besides, he adds, his clothes are about "timelessness, not the trend of the moment".\par \par \uc2 So would he ever put down his fabric scissors and retire? "I don't think so. Why would I? This is the best job in the world."\par \par \uc2 Document NS00000020140513ea5d0004n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

We forget, however, that all this has happened several times before, admittedly long ago.\par \par \uc2 I wonder if it would make a vast difference to unemployment if \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  were totally stopped. I'm not convinced that jobless Britons would race to take up vacancies. There are generations who have never worked and been, if not happy, at least content to idle away their lives. The welfare state has made that happen.\par \par \uc2 Eastern Europeans mostly come here prepared to work. Some will inevitably join the benefits brigade but thousands of them are doing jobs that Britons don't want and doing them well. Just ask employers whom they prefer. We need to face the truth.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140513ea5d0002z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 A FOREIGN killer has won the right to stay in Britain indefinitely \u8211\'20\'13 and to keep his identity secret \u8211\'20\'13 after claiming that his human rights would be breached if he was separated from his extended family.\par \par \uc2 The Somali man, who can only be identified by the initials MAI, was jailed for five years for manslaughter and has a string of other convictions.\par \par \uc2 Even though he is unmarried and has no children, the 38\u8211\'20\'13year\u8211\'20\'13old claimed he could not be deported by the Home Office because it would breach his human rights to separate him from his mother, grown\u8211\'20\'13up siblings, and other family.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  judges ruled that he would have his rights infringed under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to "private and family life".\par \par \uc2 The man also claimed he would be attacked in his homeland by relatives of the man he killed.\par \par \uc2 The judges granted him anonymity, meaning he can never be publicly named. Dominic Raab, the Tory MP who is campaigning for reform of human rights legislation, said: "It can't be right that such a dangerous man, a convicted killer, with a string of other violent offences to his name, can frustrate his deportation so easily by claiming family ties here.\par \par \uc2 "This is not even a case involving children or any other dependents. Frankly, his feet shouldn't touch the ground."\par \par \uc2 MAI has a long and violent criminal record. He was convicted of the manslaughter of another Somali, known only by the initials FA, in 1998 at Cardiff Crown Court.\par \par \uc2 After his release from prison, in December 2004 he was convicted of affray and handed a community order, and then a nine\u8211\'20\'13month jail term four years later for unlawful wounding.\par \par \uc2 In February 2012 he was fined for being drunk and disorderly, and in May that year \u8211\'20\'13 his most recent offence \u8211\'20\'13 MAI was jailed for six months for common assault.\par \par \uc2 The Home Office said it would appeal against the judges' decision.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140513ea5d0003m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw119\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1785\pichgoal600

Michelle Rhodes, of Simpson Millar solicitors, warned that the number of claims could run into hundreds. 'With successive cuts in staffing levels by governments, the workload has increased greatly,' she said.\par \par \uc2 'Officers have been forced to work for hours on end doing repetitive tasks leading to damage to their arms and shoulders. This problem has then been compounded by management.' Some of the border staff who are taking legal action worked at other French ports but most were employed at Calais, the busiest.\par \par \uc2 Lucy Moreton, of the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Services Union, said: 'Managers must address the issues rather than sweeping them under the carpet.'\par \par \uc2 The Home Office said: 'We do not routinely comment on individual cases. Border Force officers do a vital job protecting the border and we take the welfare of our staff extremely seriously.'\par \par \uc2 The ruling is the latest example of the compensation culture sweeping through the public sector.\par \par \uc2 Last year the Mail revealed that police officers are pocketing more than \u163\'00\'A320million a year in personal injury claims over mishaps on duty such as tripping up and slipping over. They are being encouraged to claim by a hotline run by the Police Federation.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140512ea5d0002s\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 TV&Showbiz\par \b \uc2 Another hair raising look!

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Bad peers could soon be out of the House for good\b0\par\par\uc2 Andy McSmith   \par \uc2 640 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2014\par \uc2 The Independent\par \uc2 IND\par \uc2 1ST\par 24\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News | The Diary\par \par \uc2 The most scandalous aspect of the story of Lord Hanningfield, the expenses cheat whose membership of Parliament has been suspended, is not the brass-necked way that he thinks he is entitled to \u163\'00\'A3300-a-day tax-free for doing no work, but that he will be allowed back in the Lords in 2015.\par \par \uc2 There is nothing anybody can do to take away a peer's membership of the House of Lords. Even the sanction of suspending them is new, and any suspension automatically ends when there is a general election. They cannot be sanctioned at all by Parliament if they commit a criminal offence that is not related to their parliamentary role.\par \par \uc2 In 2007, the Labour peer Nazir Ahmed was driving along the M1 when his car killed a man who had got out of his vehicle after an accident. Lord Ahmed had been sending and receiving texts while he was at the wheel, only minutes before the crash. He was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison. As soon as he was out of prison, he could resume his seat in the House of Lords, having done nothing that breached its code of conduct.\par \par \uc2 But slowly change is coming. The law will soon allow that a peer who is sentenced to a year in prison or more can be permanently expelled. It is proposed that the code of conduct be revised so that peers who bring the House into disrepute, such as Lord Ahmed, can be disciplined. None of this will affect Lord Ahmed or Lord Hanningfield, because the changes will not be retrospective.\par \par \uc2 An unhelpful hand?\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and Boris Johnson were travelling to Harrow when the Mayor spotted a woman collapsing in the street. They told their driver to pull over, and Cameron held the woman's hand until the ambulance arrived. It was, I suppose, the right and noble thing to do, yet for some people, to be lying on a pavement feeling ill would be bad enough. Having the Prime Minister looming over you would only make it worse.\par \par \uc2 Ukip's bottom line\par \par \uc2 Gary Robinson, a member of Ukip, has deleted a tweet in which he complained about Ukip being at the bottom of the ballot paper for the EU elections. "I was receiving an abusive tweet about it every few minutes. How would you like it?" he complains. Mr Robinson had not grasped that Ukip was at the bottom of the ballot paper because the parties are arranged in alphabetical order.\par \par \uc2 Equality BNP-style\par \par \uc2 The London spokesman for the fast-disappearing British National Party, one Steve Squire, has managed to out-xenophobe Ukip while accusing them of discrimination. He told the \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2  website: "Ukip's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy discriminates against white Europeans, whereas our \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy is non-discriminatory. We don't pick on white people from Europe: we don't care where you come from, black or Asian or white, we don't want you. We think that is a non-racist position."\par \par \uc2 Over their dead bodies\par \par \uc2 The campaign against the proposed HS2 rail link has been principally a protest movement by people worried about the value of their homes while pretending to be concerned about the environment; but in Camden someone has shown a flash of wit.\par \par \uc2 There is a letter on the website of the Camden New Journal purportedly signed by some of the famous residents of St James's Garden complaining about the disturbance they will suffer. The "signatories" are Charles Fitzroy, the First Baron Southampton, James Christie, founder of the auction house, the painters George Morland and John Hoppner, and Matthew Flinders, a hydrographer, each of whom has been dead for at least 200 years. St James's Garden is their burial ground.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140513ea5d0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 THE TUESDAY BOOK Family Life By Akhil Sharma \uc2 Faber & Faber\uc2  \u163\'00\'A314.99\par \par \uc2 Akhil Sharma's sharply observed autobiographical novel Family Life begins as a story about an aspirational \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  family's attempt to create a "better" life for themselves in the US. In his effort to assimilate, the narrator's father makes his sons watch the news and films such as The Empire Strikes Back. With religious devotion, the family prepares the elder son Birju for one of the best high schools.\par \par \uc2 These aspirations, however, are drowned at the bottom of a swimming pool. For this is where Birju hits his head one day and suffers brain damage. Henceforth, Family Life reveals the ways in which people respond to personal tragedy, including turning to the comfort and familiarity of religion, culture and community. The narrator's father becomes an alcoholic; in the middle of night he watches Hindi comedy films. The narrator's mother, clinging to an unerring faith that her son will get better, performs religious rituals, turns to "miracle" healers and eventually takes her son out of the nursing home to look after him at home. This faith also leads her, the novel suggests, to neglect her younger son, the narrator Ajay, who at the time of the accident is 10 years old.\par \par \uc2 For Ajay, it is reading, telling fellow pupils stories about his life and eventually writing that gives meaning to his life. For this is a novel, too, about writing as a mode of experiencing. "I began to see my family's pain as belonging in a story... at the idea of writing sentences that contained our suffering, I experienced both the triumph that I felt when I told Jeff and Michael Bu about Birju, and also a sort of detachment..."\par \par \uc2 While literature "saves" the narrator, there is also a suggestion that there is something disturbing about approaching emotions with such detachment; everything is material to be "used". Even as a child, the narrator is distant and self-aware; he performs love, anxious that it doesn't come naturally.\par \par \uc2 This self-awareness extends to the narrator's sense of inferiority and shame in respect to the West, to white Americans who curse as he and his mother walk down the street, who bully him at school. The novel reveals the subtle effects of white supremacy, and how it is internalised. For Ajay, the Indians with an American accent are better than recently arrived Indians. Above them are Jews, for they have white skin.\par \par \uc2 Stripped away, this version of Sharma's life tells a familiar story about the "suffocation" and "oppression" of South Asian family life (exacerbated by the accident) and his "escape" from this through literature and education. It is its compassion and complexity that makes this novel stand out.\par \par \uc2 Order for \u163\'00\'A313.49 (free p&p) from the Independent Bookshop: 08430 600 030\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140513ea5d0002c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

But the poster drew the ire of a Ukip councillor who complained to the police. The matter might have ended there but instead two officers were sent to interview Mr Abberton at his home.\par \par \uc2 The police's decision to question the blogger has led to calls for Theresa May, the Home Secretary, to investigate the matter and Julian Hibbert, the Liberal Democrat MP for Cambridge, described it as "astonishing". He is waiting for a detailed response from the police.\par \par \uc2 Writing on his blog, Mr Abberton described the incident - and claimed the officers told him that he should not publicise the visit. "They said [the visit] was in relation to a complaint that had been made by a certain political party in relation to tweets I had published about them and one tweet in particular which talked about 10 reasons to vote for them," he said.\par \par \uc2 "The PC wanted to know if I had made that poster. They asked me to 'take it down' but I said I couldn't do that as it had already been retweeted and copied many times and I no longer had any control of it. They said that they couldn't force me to take it down anyway."\par \par \uc2 The officers told him that he couldn't tweet about their visit as it might undermine their appearance of impartiality ahead of the upcoming elections.\par \par \uc2 A Cambridgeshire Police spokesman confirmed the visit but said officers had not told Mr Abberton to delete tweets.\par \par \uc2 But the Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said the police action was "both disturbing and surprising... That an apparently general complaint from a political party about not liking what was said about them could have led to a police visit... is an extremely serious incident."\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140513ea5d00020\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 COMMENT\par \b \uc2 Conservatives still fail to grasp the minority vote\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janan Ganesh   \par \uc2 858 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2014\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFTA\par \uc2 USA Ed1\par 07\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Conservative MPs who fancy themselves as no-nonsense should spend a day with the patriarch of an Asian household. Tories who think they are serious about faith and family should visit a black Pentecostal church. They will leave both establishments feeling like dilettantes. Self-reliance, enterprise, educational rigour - many causes imagined to be "rightwing" in London's politico-media zones constitute mere common sense in some ethnic minority communities.\par \par \uc2 So the Conservatives should fare well among such voters. Instead, they are not loosely competitive with the Labour party. Last week a report by the think-tank Policy Exchange charted the dimensions of a problem that has the potential to crush the Tories. Britain's five largest minorities - Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, black Africans and Afro-Carribeans - are growing from 14 per cent of the population to potentially 30 per cent by 2050. Even adjusting for income, they are overwhelmingly Labour. Sixty-one per cent identify with the opposition party; just 9 per cent favour the Tories. Even the most pro- Conservative group, Indians, prefer Labour by 54 per cent to 17 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Just as US Republicans struggle with the growing Hispanic electorate, the Tories face their own demographic reckoning. They are in this fix for the same reason they have been generally unpopular for a generation: they think politics is about policy. If someone agrees with you on most of the issues of the day - so this line of reasoning goes - you can count on their vote. This is exquisitely logical and very wrong.\par \par \uc2 Voters do not judge a party only or even mainly by its manifesto. Many cannot name a specific policy commitment even as they mark their ballot paper. A party stands or falls by the gut impression it creates during the sporadic flashes in which voters pay any attention to politics. Its "brand", to use an obnoxious but stubbornly useful term, is what it lives by. If all the Tory modernisers have achieved in the past decade is to make this point, their movement was worthwhile.\par \par \uc2 For many minority voters, the impression created by the Tory party is one of ambivalence about diversity. Specifically, they detect something verging on regret about the waves of migration from the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean that reconstituted British society after the second world war.\par \par \uc2 This impression is grievously wide of the mark; a prejudice in itself. Many Tories, including several in the cabinet, are effortless cosmopolitans. Even those who are not mean it when they say that Britain has been enriched by its newcomers over the past half-century and more. These are not people who daydream about going back in time and turning the Empire Windrush away at Tilbury docks. But a reputation does not have to be accurate to be fatal.\par \par \uc2 Some of this reality is dawning on the party. More Tories accept that, if even some very conservative people are voting Labour , policy might not be the decisive variable. They are especially taken by the example of the Canadian Conservatives, who improved their standing among minority voters through grand gestures and constant campaigning. There is another example nearer at hand. \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2 , the nationalist first minister of Scotland, has crafted that unusual thing: a nationalism that minority voters feel relaxed about signing up to. It probably helps that he talks about Scotland as an open country with an eye for industrious \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And here is the crux. The Tories quote impeccable research showing that minorities are at least as hostile to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as white voters. So the party talks about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  often and very negatively in the confidence this is not turning off blacks and Asians. And after all, the migrants who bear the rhetorical brunt are white Christians from eastern and central Europe.\par \par \uc2 This is where the politics of logic hits a wall. Put simply, a Tory complaining about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  "means" something different - in the mind of a voter - than a Labour politician saying the same words. It means unease with a diverse society. This is even true among white voters, who in focus groups are less likely to endorse a given \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy once they learn it belongs to the Tories.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is intensely unpopular in the country and within the Tory party. Its leaders would be quixotic to not reflect that view. But whenever they do, it risks aggravating their reputation among minorities. It is very difficult to hear the party grumble about the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  of the past decade without wondering what it makes of the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  of the past 60 years.\par \par \uc2 A political message can be popular on its own terms but still lose votes by hardening suspicions about the party propounding it. The Tories used to dominate entire centuries of British politics because they had the subtlety of mind to intuit this kind of human quirk, while others bet the house on cold logic and literalism. A party that used to define itself against rationalist naivety has become drunk on the stuff. It is only making it harder to entice a multicoloured electorate.\par \par \uc2 janan.ganesh@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140513ea5d0002p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

He said the Tory lead was slender and that only 12 per cent said "the economy is recovering from the recession and I am feeling better off as a result".\par \par \uc2 The latest round of coalition infighting over education policy is unlikely to boost support for either the Tories or Liberal Democrats, but the Ashcroft poll - in which 1,001 adults were interviewed by telephone between May 9 and 11 - suggests some voters would like to see Nick Clegg's party have a bigger say in government.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile Ed Miliband sought to shift the debate on to safer ground as he unveiled a new "GP guarantee" that anyone can get an appointment at their surgery within 48 hours.\par \par \uc2 Speaking in Manchester last night, the Labour leader said the proportion of patients receiving a GP appointment within two days had fallen from 80 per cent under the last Labour government to 40 per cent today.\par \par \uc2 Janan Ganesh\uc2 , Page 11\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140513ea5d0000h\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 I doubt Her Majesty will ever truly be ready to hand over to her son\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Hill   \par \uc2 1,025 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2014\par 01:01\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 NO ONE can fault the Queen for her workload. At 88, an age when most of her subjects have been retired for years, she still carries out scores of engagements with unflappable grace.\par \par \uc2 But she can\u8217\'20\'19t go on for ever and last week she finally gave in and agreed not to tackle steep stairs at Westminster Abbey, instead allowing the Prince of Wales to stand in at a ceremony.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Why doesn\u8217\'20\'19t the Queen hand over completely to her son, you might well ask. She has put in a lifetime of service and richly deserves a rest. Monarchs in other countries have no problem with abdication but in Britain the word has a bad connotation. It was Edward VIII\u8217\'20\'19s selfish decision to pursue his love life that led to Elizabeth\u8217\'20\'19s father becoming king, a role he was unprepared for and which probably contributed to his early death.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The Queen long ago resolved that it would be for life but I\u8217\'20\'19m sure she would heartily welcome some respite from endless meetings and greetings. It might seem like a dream job but just imagine seeing only fawning faces day after day, everyone on their best behaviour \u8211\'20\'13 apart from her husband \u8211\'20\'13 and \u8220\'20\'1CYour Majestying\u8221\'20\'1D. It\u8217\'20\'19s so unreal. Why not let Charles gradually take on more duties? And yet I doubt if the Queen will ever be ready to hand over. Hard luck, son.\par \par \uc2 ..........................................................................................................\par \par \uc2 Trip Advisor reviews are good entertainment, but no more\par \par \uc2 Some contributors to Trip Adviser have been accused of blackmailing hotels and restaurants, threatening to submit nasty comments if they don\u8217\'20\'19t get freebies or special deals. It\u8217\'20\'19s such an obvious flaw in the website that I suspect such abuses have been going on for years.\par \par \uc2 I do occasionally look on Trip Adviser and similar sites but there\u8217\'20\'19s little point because the comments are usually so diverse that it\u8217\'20\'19s impossible to draw a conclusion. A place can be the most wonderful experience ever and the weekend from hell. The same staff are smart and attentive and sloppy and rude. The food is heavenly and inedible.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s also the professional complainer who goes out of his way to find fault and gets a kick out of seeing his moans in print. At the other extreme are the customers who just want to be nice and will praise purgatory. The truth is these guides are no more than entertainment.\par \par \uc2 ..........................................................................................................\par \par \uc2 The Beeb, Claudia Winkleman and the nasty spread of\u160\'00\'A0Positive discrimination\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The BBC was determined to give Bruce Forsyth\u8217\'20\'19s job to a woman and it looks as if a woman will be picked to front the new mega version of Civilisation, not necessarily because she\u8217\'20\'19s the top candidate.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Positive discrimination is one of the nastiest types of political correctness. It leads to resentment and injustice and it has become part of our culture. Would anyone want a job on that basis? Don\u8217\'20\'19t kid yourself. Thousands would \u8211\'20\'13 it\u8217\'20\'19s dog eat dog, cat eat cat.\par \par \uc2 Equal pay for \u8220\'20\'1Cequal work\u8221\'20\'1D is another form of positive discrimination. Unions are pushing it to the limit and although some women\u8217\'20\'19s pay has increased it has also caused wages in general to stagnate and led to thousands of job losses because organisations can\u8217\'20\'19t find the extra money.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The unions haven\u8217\'20\'19t learned to be careful what they wish for. They either don\u8217\'20\'19t see the danger of unintended consequences or don\u8217\'20\'19t care.\par \par \uc2 ..........................................................................................................\par \par \uc2 Slowing down the Countdown\par \par \uc2 Drivers are fuming over plans for traffic lights to stay on red longer to give pedestrians more time to cross the road. Well I\u8217\'20\'19m no slouch but I find many crossings a rush. It\u8217\'20\'19s stressful when the lights change before you make it to the other side with drivers snarling at you through their windscreens.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The best crossings are those with countdown clocks. You know exactly how long you\u8217\'20\'19ve got and whether you can make it but of course some chancers abuse them by walking with just a second or two left.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 I fondly recall a holiday in New England where drivers stuck rigidly to 10 or 15mph limits on high streets and stopped to let pedestrians go even when there were no crossings. If only we had such New World courtesy here.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Some hope.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 ..........................................................................................................\par \par \uc2 Lazy Brits need to face the truth - Eastern Europeans are more prepared to work\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  has reached insane levels and the result is Britain\u8217\'20\'19s population will soon be completely changed because minorities are having more children than the natives. We forget, however, that all this has happened several times before, admittedly long ago.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 I wonder if it would make a vast difference to unemployment if \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  were totally stopped. I\u8217\'20\'19m not convinced that jobless Britons would race to take up vacancies. There are generations who have never worked and been, if not happy, at least content to idle away their lives. The welfare state has made that happen.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Eastern Europeans mostly come here prepared to work. Some will inevitably join the benefits brigade but thousands of them are doing jobs that Britons don\u8217\'20\'19t want and doing them well. Just ask employers whom they prefer. We need to face the truth.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 ..........................................................................................................\par \par \uc2 Gary Barlow performing a sell-out gig despite his recent tax evasion scandal [GETTY]\par \par \uc2 Gary Barlow dodges tax - but remains in popularity polls\par \par \uc2 Take That\u8217\'20\'19s Gary Barlow is apparently more popular than ever despite being caught out as a big-time tax dodger. He\u8217\'20\'19s not alone. Other stars such as Jimmy Carr aren\u8217\'20\'19t exactly shunned and huge companies such as Amazon, \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  are still reporting enormous profits while paying peanuts in tax.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 You\u8217\'20\'19d think the people trapped in pay-as-you-earn would boycott the fiddlers but they just wish they could join them.

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 With each new medical innovation, the odds that we will have to confront sudden death decrease. But\u160\'00\'A0is this a triumph or a tragedy? Jacob M Appel argues that the way we die now affects how we live\par \par \uc2 My great-grandfather, Simon Litman, Latvian \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , secular Jew, inept businessman, gifted egg candler, doting father, cigar-smoker and pint-sized omnivore who (at least in family lore) could devour his own body weight in gribenes, holds the distinction of being the last of my forbears to drop dead.\par \par \uc2 He made his dramatic exit on a balmy spring evening in 1950, strolling home with his wife from a Saturday supper at my grandmother's house. At the dinner table, he'd appeared in good health and good cheer. Nevertheless, several blocks up the avenue, opposite a fire station, he told my great-grandmother, "I don't feel so good," then clutched one hand to his chest, fell to his knees and stopped breathing. He was 60 years old.\par \par \uc2 To this day, my 91-year-old grandmother remains livid that none of the firemen responded to her mother's cries for help. "They must have heard her," she says. "How could they not have heard her?" Of course, that was before defibrillators and vasopressors, an era when dropping dead was a natural part of life. If the entire fire department had arrived en masse with paramedics in tow, they'd have had nothing therapeutic to offer.\par \par \uc2 Six decades after Great-Grandpa Simon plunged off his mortal coil, sudden death now threatens to go the way of rotary telephones and passenger pigeons. The exact rate at which we are not dropping dead is difficult to calculate: while governments keep meticulous records on the causes of our deaths, and the ages at which we perish, it makes no effort to estimate the speed of our grand finales.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, as a physician, my anecdotal sense is that we're not dying nearly as suddenly as we once did. "When I started as an intern," an elderly colleague recently observed at a staff meeting, "most patients only stayed in the hospital for a day or two. Either you got better or you didn't. Lingering wasn't part of the protocol."\par \par \uc2 Today, in contrast, lingering is the norm. You are forced out of hospital by insurance companies, not rigor mortis. Where, a generation ago, the expectation was for men to retire at 65 and keel over at 67 \u8211\'20\'13 the basis for the pension plans now bankrupting local governments \u8211\'20\'13 a massive myocardial infarction in one's fifth or sixth decade is no longer inevitable. Stress tests and statins and improved resuscitation methods mean we are more likely to survive to our second heart attack, live beyond our third stroke. Life ends with a whimper, not a bang.\par \par \uc2 That is not to say that the Grim Reaper never arrives on a bolt of lightning: I've lost a medical-school mentor to a plane crash, a neighbour to suicide, a childhood friend to a brain aneurysm. Thousands of people, smoking less but eating more, still do succumb to heart attacks in their fifties and sixties. But we greet these swift departures not only with grief, as we have always done, but also with a sense of indignation simmering toward outrage. In an age of prenatal genetic testing and full-body PET scans and rampant agnosticism, all varieties of death strike many of us as anathema. Death without fair warning becomes truly obscene.\par \par \uc2 Increasingly, our first associations with "sudden death" are metaphorical. "Sudden death" terminates World Cup matches, not the lives of our friends and relatives. Some time ago, I had the pleasure of seeing the singer Molly Hager in concert, a woman who embodies my \u8211\'20\'13 and many other men's \u8211\'20\'13 epitome of feminine beauty, and I made the mistake of observing to my date that Ms Hager was "drop-dead gorgeous". My date replied, acidly: "In that case, keep staring." Needless to say, as forcefully as I ogled, my heart beat only faster; it did not stop. "Drop-dead gorgeous", of course, means far less in a world where people don't actually drop dead. (Insert a comma between "dead" and "gorgeous" and it sounds like a threat Humphrey Bogart might have served up to Lauren Bacall during a spat.) We can speak figuratively about sudden death, trivialise it \u8211\'20\'13 even joke about it \u8211\'20\'13 because we do not actually expect to confront it. Not now, not soon, not until we've been afforded ample time to prepare. And with each new medical innovation, the odds are more likely that we won't.\par \par \uc2 My own family doctor has a sign on his office door that reads: "Sudden death is God's way of telling you to slow down." If that is indeed the case, God has been letting us accelerate with impunity for some time now.\par \par \uc2 In 1958, John Kenneth Galbraith's The Affluent Society reminded us that, for the first time in human history, we lived in a civilisation where a majority of people did not have to worry about basic subsistence. More than five decades later, we find ourselves belonging to the first human civilisation where sudden death is the glaring exception, not the expectation.\par \par \uc2 The novelty of our position is all too easy to forget; it is even easier to assume without questioning that the present state of affairs reflects progress. After all, which of us wouldn't rather die well-prepared at 90 than suddenly at 55? And yet, the more I see of death, the less convinced I become that, in this medical and social revolution, we have not lost something of considerable value. I certainly don't mean to glorify premature death: I suspect that both "dying with one's boots on" and "living fast, loving hard and dying young" are highly overrated feats. I do not believe that it is either dulce or decorum to die at 25 for one's country.\par \par \uc2 My concern is also not with the economic effects of the long goodbye: the per cent of healthcare cash spent in the last six months of life, the prospect of every gainfully employed worker supporting two retirees. Rather, my disquiet is principally for lost human dignity. Gloria Taylor, the Canadian right-to-die activist, who suffers from Lou Gehrig's disease, recently wrote: "I can accept death because I recognise it as a part of life. What I fear is a death that negates, as opposed to concludes, my life." Sudden death is a conclusion. Too often, I fear, the long goodbye devolves into a negation.\par \par \uc2 The contrast between the death of my grandmother's father and that of her husband 58 years later is highly revealing. Grandpa Leo, a Belgian refugee who earned a comfortable living in the jewellery business, developed prostate cancer in his early seventies, survived a mild heart attack at age 77, and by his mid-eighties had trouble remembering the names of his sisters. And then, at 86, he developed a metastatic lesion on the surface of his brain. In\u160\'00\'A01950, the cancer would have killed him in a matter of months. In 2006, a skilled neurosurgeon managed to scoop out the bulk of the tumour, enabling my grandfather to survive to a series of small strokes a full year later. Once again, these cerebral insults \u8211\'20\'13 as the medical chart termed them \u8211\'20\'13 would certainly have ended an octogenarian's life in his own father-in-law's generation. But after a two-month-long hospital stay and tens of thousands worth of hi-tech imaging, modern anti-coagulants enabled Grandpa Leo to roll into a nursing home that he actually believed to be his mother's apartment in pre-war Antwerp.\par \par \uc2 I visited him one afternoon and he announced how much he loved his wife \u8211\'20\'13 but he was actually referring to the young West African woman assigned to change his bed linen. It took two intubations, weeks on a ventilator, multiple courses of dialysis and a month of unconsciousness before my grandmother finally brought the process of her husband's dying to a halt. By then, the man I'd worshipped as a child for his vigour and independence had gone nearly a half a year without responding to his own name. When Grandpa Leo died \u8211\'20\'13 after the best nursing care imaginable \u8211\'20\'13 his entire torso had become one enormous bedsore, his back and shoulders assuming the colour of a side of tenderised beef.\par \par \uc2 Is my grandfather's longevity a triumph or a tragedy? On the one hand, I am grateful that I had an opportunity to know my grandfather well into my own adulthood \u8211\'20\'13 an opportunity that my father never had. On the other hand, faced with the prospect of following in my grandfather's footsteps, I'd much rather drop dead in front of a fire station at 60.\par \par \uc2 In medical ethics \u8211\'20\'13 the field in which I do my academic research and writing \u8211\'20\'13 the way we now die has led to the birth of entirely novel schools of thought. When life was truly brutish and short, whether in Hobbes's 16-century London or Great-Grandpa Simon's mid 20th-century New York, the idealistic notion that all life was sacred and must be preserved at any cost carried limited weight in medical and moral circles.\par \par \uc2 Although we have come to think of the modern era as one in which we tolerate less excess medical care than in past generations, the reality is that physicians and patients were once much more accepting of death than they are now. They had to be. The so-called "culture of life", so recently embraced by the Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention, generally advances the view that life in its essence, rather than its quality, is of paramount value. The impact of this viewpoint upon modern healthcare and medical discourse cannot be underestimated. Yet this dogma is far more a product of technology and material change than of theological evolution. In a world in which people keeled over on street corners without advance notice, the notion of controlling (or even defeating) death made little sense.\par \par \uc2 The slow demise of sudden death has also reshaped vast aspects of our culture and our iconography with little notice and less comment. How does it alter our society to live in a world influenced by elder statesmen \u8211\'20\'13 and then to watch those elder statesmen totter into decrepitude? Franklin Roosevelt will forever be a jaunty 63, Adlai Stevenson a distinguished 65. In contrast, Ronald Reagan, as his memory faded and his world grew smaller, lost much of his magic. Clark Gable didn't lock in his permanent sex appeal as Rhett Butler or Fletcher Christian, but with a catastrophic thrombosis at 59. It's not so clear that an extra two decades enhanced Marlon Brando's legacy.\par \par \uc2 Whether these changes are beneficial or deleterious, they are likely irreversible \u8211\'20\'13 at least by rational planning. Needless to say, we can't ethically go around inducing cardiac arrests in healthy 60-year-olds. What we can do \u8211\'20\'13 and what we have not been doing \u8211\'20\'13 is pay closer attention to the complex ways in which how we die is transforming how we live.\par \par \uc2 I fear that the most subtle, yet most pernicious, consequence of a world in which people do not die suddenly is a world in which people do not appreciate life. My great-grandfather's favourite expression \u8211\'20\'13 one of the few memories remaining of him to the rapidly shrinking circle of old-timers who still remember his earthly presence at all \u8211\'20\'13 was, fittingly: "We're so lucky to be alive!"\par \par \uc2 Great-Grandpa Simon uttered these words in Yiddish, of course; his limited English was reserved for essential business transactions with gentiles. And coursing through them was clearly not only an awareness of the vagaries of natural death, but also the threat of violent demise at the hands of his fellow human beings, the ever-fresh memory of his baby sisters and their families slaughtered by Nazi Einsatzgruppen in the Daugavpils ghetto. (Ironically and fittingly, a generation later, my Grandpa Leo's favourite expression was: "Where there's life, there's hope.")\par \par \uc2 Today, a brush with death often drives us to re-examine our lives, the starting point of many a popular movie and middle-age crisis. Half a century ago, men like my great-grandfather didn't require such a brush with death: living past 50 was itself enough of a risk to generate reflection and gratitude.\par \par \uc2 Jacob M.

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Comment and Debate Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: Salute the super-rich: It should be a cause for celebration that Britain's stability makes it a magnet for billionaires\b0\par\par\uc2 Ian Birrell   \par \uc2 645 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 28\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 There is something repellent about the likes of James Stunt, who married billionaire Bernie Ecclestone's daughter and drives around London with his security team in a fleet of flash cars worth a million pounds. So it is little wonder that the startling news that our capital is home to more super-rich than any other place on the planet has sparked outrage.\par \par \uc2 Britain now has more than 100 billionaires, according to a Sunday Times survey - more per head than any other country. Most live in London, and more than half were born abroad. For many Britons, such revelations confirm fears the nation has become a magnet for dodgy characters, crystallising concerns over globalisation, inequality, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and tax avoidance.\par \par \uc2 Certainly, it is wrong to see the ultra-wealthy dodge taxes as they flit around the world, and there should be far more scrutiny of people permitted to buy their way into Britain and launder their stained reputations. But however much it sticks in the craw to discover there is a market for gold-plated revolving safes, this is ultimately cause for celebration.\par \par \uc2 It is first and foremost a big vote of confidence in Britain. We moan about our public institutions, but the problems pale beside those facing most countries. Those super-rich Russians and Chinese - the biggest buyers of investor visas for people committing at least pounds 1m - see a stable political system, an open economy, honest courts and incorruptible officials. For all its faults, Britain remains a beacon of democracy, freedom and tolerance.\par \par \uc2 It also reflects the astonishing transformation of London, which in my lifetime has gone from being a dirty, dreary and declining place with rapidly falling population to one of the world's most diverse, vibrant and successful cities. Much of this is attributable to \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , attracted to the UK for many of the same reasons as those billionaires and multimillionaires. Cities are the motors of the global economy; the top 10 alone account for a fifth of output worldwide. This mix of rich and ambitious migrants has played a crucial role helping to power London into prominence. Other European cities can only look on with envy as they generate jobs and prosperity.\par \par \uc2 This influx of wealthy people also highlights how London and the south-east has become the most capitalist and globalised part of the UK, a thriving region that props up the economy and supports the welfare state. London alone accounts for close to a quarter of the economy while paying a similar share of income and corporation taxes; its output per person is about double the national average. The southeast is the only region making a positive contribution to the exchequer.\par \par \uc2 So it was absurd to hear the business secretary, Vince Cable, complain last year that London was sucking life from the rest of the country. Likewise, Labour should think carefully about plans to pursue the politics of envy or milk the capital with blunderbuss tactics such as a mansion tax.\par \par \uc2 It is wrong to be Panglossian. One property developer told me of a foreign investor buying 16 houses and wanting them "bubble-wrapped" - not bothering to rent them, merely seeking capital appreciation. But housing shortages are largely down to political failures, not rich foreign buyers. Meanwhile taxes paid on all those pads sold to oligarchs in Kensington and Chelsea contribute more than combined house sale proceeds in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\par \par \uc2 Public services may be stretched and resentment growing at the super-rich. Yet there is one thing that's far worse than Britain being a haven for the world's richest people - and that is when they move to more successful and welcoming destinations.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @ianbirrell\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140512ea5d00063\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Comment and Debate Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: Bigots come in all ages: Nigel Farage is wrong to say older people are anti-gay - but the caricature isn't a surprise\b0\par\par\uc2 Anne Karpf   \par \uc2 732 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 28\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Homosexuality makes most people over 70 feel uncomfortable, according to Nigel Farage. The Ukip leader was attempting to defend Roger Helmer, his candidate in next month's Newark byelection, who had claimed that some older people found homosexuality "distasteful if not viscerally repugnant". (Others would say that this was a better description of Ukip itself.) Farage clearly feels not only the need to protect the rights of prejudiced people of every stripe but also entitled to speak on behalf of most older people. In fact he was simply enacting the latest variant of how many people can you fit into a Mini: how many stereotypes can you fit into Ukip?\par \par \uc2 As it happens, Farage is wrong about acceptance of homosexuality diminishing with age. A recent Pew Research Centre study found that, in the UK, 79% of 18- to 29-year-olds thought that homosexuality should be accepted, as did 82% of 30- to 49-year-olds and 71% of those in the 50-plus group. Unless the older figure conceals a sudden lurch towards disapproval on our 70th birthdays, acceptance in Britain remains relatively constant across the age bands. In other words, age doesn't seem to be a significant factor in shaping attitudes to homosexuality.\par \par \uc2 But we shouldn't be surprised that Farage caricatures old people in this way, for the discourse around age is very similar to that surrounding \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 : both old people and \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are "other", regarded as homogenous, monolithic groups - a different species (and God help you if you're an older \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 ). Of course we form attitudes to all manner of things when we're young, but this doesn't mean that they never change. Behind the characterisation of older people as anti-gay lies the notion that age brings a kind of mental sclerosis and calcifying of ideas.\par \par \uc2 In reality older people are confronted by change on a daily basis: changes in cultural values and changes in their own bodies and physical capacities. The ability to adapt is a key attribute that enables us to grow through the ageing process. If we're going to indulge in age stereotyping it's more likely to be young people who are convinced of the correctness of their views than older people, who've witnessed such transformations both socially and personally. But of course older people are no more a homogenous group than young: bigotry doesn't discriminate on the basis of age.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Solomon\uc2 's fine book Far From the Tree, winner of the Wellcome prize, shows movingly how parents can come to accept difference in their children, whether they're deaf, prodigies or gay - what he calls "learned happiness". We may not be infinitely malleable, but the human capacity to change is awesome - the legalisation of gay marriage is already demonstrating that. It's still startling to hear a man talk of his husband or a woman of her wife. In five years' time I'll bet you Roger Helmer's deposit most of us won't notice it, whatever the year of our birth.\par \par \uc2 I've just come from talking to a group of older women - g.o.d. (Growing Old Disgracefully), founded in 1993. I asked them for their reaction to Farage's comments. They were unanimous: don't characterise people on the basis of age. As one of them put it: "It's about closed minds. But minds don't necessarily close with age." Another balked at the idea that you should excuse prejudice on the grounds of age, suggesting that people should be prepared to take responsibility for their views at any age. A third felt patronised by Farage's comments, as though most old people were halfway to Alzheimer's - not that this would inevitably make them prejudiced.\par \par \uc2 One other fact doesn't seem to have occurred to Farage: that many over-70s are themselves gay. Some had to conceal the fact when they were younger (and others became virulently homophobic instead). Indeed there are now so many older women coming out as lesbians that the phenomenon has acquired its own moniker - Out Late. Some of them might even live in Newark.\par \par \uc2 Anne Karpf is the author of How to Age\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140512ea5d00062\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Prime minister's comments follow 'cast-iron' pledge that referendum on UK membership of EU will take place by 2017\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  has said he would not resign as prime minister if Britain voted to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ahead of this month's European elections, the Conservative leader has said he "absolutely" gives a cast-iron pledge that a referendum on Britain's EU membership will happen before the end of 2017.\par \par \uc2 He also said he would not "sit on the fence" if he did not get the outcome he wanted in renegotiations about the UK's relationship with Brussels, hinting that he could campaign to leave the EU in certain circumstances.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether he would resign if the UK voted to leave, Cameron told ITV's Good Morning Britain: "The point about these referendums is that there is a question on these referendums and the question is not 'do you want the prime minister to stay or go?' \u8211\'20\'13 whether it's the case with Scotland or Europe; the question is, in the case of Scotland, 'do you want Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom?', 'do you want the United Kingdom to stay in Europe?'"\par \par \uc2 Cameron has been fleshing out some of his aims for EU reform, including tougher restrictions on migrants claiming benefits and exempting Britain from an obligation to be part of "ever closer union", which is written into the treaty of Rome.\par \par \uc2 However, he has come under pressure over his strategy on EU \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , after saying he did not want to change the right of current EU citizens to live and work in the bloc but might want tougher restrictions on freedom of movement rules imposed for new entrants if they had a low per capita income.\par \par \uc2 "Free movement within the \uc2 European Union\uc2  is important but it needs to be returned to the original concept, which was the freedom to be able to go and work in another country," he told the BBC's \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 Some Conservatives are worried about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  figures due to be published on the day of the European elections that are expected to show higher \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  into the UK from Romania and Bulgaria.\par \par \uc2 Ukip accused him of not going far enough to deal with \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from the EU. Nigel Farage, the party's leader, said voters would struggle to believe Cameron's promise to hold a referendum was "worth a row of beans".\par \par \uc2 Farage told BBC1's Sunday Politics: "He has difficulty being believed because five years ago I sat here talking to you about the European elections and you put to me: 'Well, it's going to be very difficult, Nigel, for people to vote Ukip because Mr Cameron has given a cast-iron guarantee that if he becomes prime minister next year he'll have a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.'"\par \par \uc2 "He didn't deliver on that and he knows that people struggle to believe firstly, that he will get a majority and secondly, that the renegotiation is actually worth a row of beans."\par \par \uc2 The prime minister has attacked Ukip more directly over the past week, calling the party a threat to Britain. In an appeal to his core vote, Cameron addressed an article in the Sunday Telegraph at those whose pencils were "hovering over the Conservative box on their postal votes" for the 22 May elections.\par \par \uc2 He also criticised those politicians who "refuse to be upbeat about Britain" in a thinly veiled attack on Ukip. "To them, pessimism equals patriotism," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 "They insist that our best days are behind us and that everything is bound to get worse. Like [Dad's Army's] Private Frazer politicians, they're perennially crying out that 'we're all doomed'."\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140512ea5d0008j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

In fact the figures were issued by the Office For National Statistics.\par \par \uc2 ANOTHER 30k HERE BUT.. Cam defends 'free movement'\par \par \uc2 DAVID Cameron has defended the free movement of EU migrants - amid warnings thousands more Bulgarians and Romanians have moved to Britain.\par \par \uc2 The PM sparked concern from Tory backbenchers as he declared the free movement principle was "important" ahead of vital local and European elections on May 22.\par \par \uc2 It comes after The Sun demanded that he makes \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  control a red line in his battle to win back powers from Brussels.\par \par \uc2 Figures out this week from \uc2 Oxford University\uc2 's Migration Observatory are set to show an extra 30,000 Bulgarian and Romanian workers were living in the UK in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year.\par \par \uc2 In the last quarter of 2013, there were 144,000 people - including workers and their family members - from the two countries in Britain. With 30,000 more workers expected to have arrived, the total with family members now is likely to have soared over 200,000. Restrictions on migrants coming to the UK from Romania and Bulgaria were lifted on January 1. Mr Cameron said: "I think free movement within the \uc2 European Union\uc2  is important. "But it needs to be returned to the original concept - the freedom to be able to go and work in another country."\par \par \uc2 His defence of the EU's key principle will worry Tories concerned about the rise of Ukip. David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouth, warned: "It doesn't make sense to bring people in to work when there are people here looking for jobs." The PM is renegotiating a return of powers from the EU ahead of a planned in-out referendum in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Q MR Cameron yesterday said he may call for Britain to LEAVE the EU if Brussels refuses to hand back powers.

It\u8217\'20\'19s just desperately sad that you have used your considerable charm and skills to take part in these activities.'\par \par \uc2 Izegbune is himself married to a Hungarian and has lived legally in the UK since 2009 with dual Nigerian and Hungarian nationality.\par \par \uc2 The father-of-two was jailed for 31 months after pleading guilty to five counts of conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  law.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Hungarian national Ivett Szanto, 31, admitted taking part in one fake marriage with a Nigerian man who was also seeking a visa.\par \par \uc2 She had conspired with Nigerian-born ringleader Izegbune to help set up two further marriages with men she knew from her native Budapest.\par \par \uc2 Szanto had her sham marriage stopped mid-ceremony on May 30, 2013, in Stoke, Staffordshire, the court heard.\par \par \uc2 Sentencing her to 20 months, Judge Stacey said: 'Your role in this was much more peripheral. You were a small cog in the wheel. It was Izegbune who was directing you.'\par \par \uc2 The court heard the fake brides handed over an unknown amount of cash in a bid to win the residence cards - which would have given them the legal right to remain in the UK and Europe.\par \par \uc2 But two of the weddings were stopped halfway through and a price list for a \u163\'00\'A37,500 ceremony was later recovered.\par \par \uc2 It showed just a \u163\'00\'A320 budget was allocated for the wedding dress, rings and shoes.\par \par \uc2 Nigerian women Nwabunwanne Eze, 35, and Chioma Nwangwu, 28, both from Birmingham, were all jailed for taking part in their own fake marriages.\par \par \uc2 Nwangu married her groom Birmingham registry office in June 2013.\par \par \uc2 Eze attempted to marry at Glasgow registry office in August 2013 - but the ceremony was raided by investigators.\par \par \uc2 She and Nwangwu pleaded guilty to one charge of breaching \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  law and were jailed for 16 months and 17 months respectively.\par \par \uc2 The court heard that four members of Eze\u8217\'20\'19s close family, including her own mother, were murdered on their farm in Nigeria in 2009.\par \par \uc2 She had studied Health and Social Care at South Birmingham College after arriving legitimately on a student visa in 2010.\par \par \uc2 She exhausted all the appeals to stay in the country and took part in the sham marriage just before she would have been forced to leave the country. She has since lodged an application seeking asylum.\par \par \uc2 Nwangwu worked in a bank in Nigeria before arriving in Birmingham to study at Birmingham City University in 2011.\par \par \uc2 She returned home, but came back on a six-month visitor visa and wanted to stay in the UK after that expired to be with her genuine partner - a Nigerian who is legally in the country.\par \par \uc2 The Nigerian women were all warned they would face possible deportation once they complete their prison sentences.\par \par \uc2 A Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is scheduled for Izegbune to be heard in September.\par \par \uc2 Speaking after sentencing Andy Radcliffe, from the Home Office\u8217\'20\'19s Criminal and Financial Investigations Team, said: 'Izegbune thought he could profit from abusing the marriage system and the UK\u8217\'20\'19s \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  laws.\par \par \uc2 'He was seen by the other individuals as their ticket to either stay in the UK, or gain financially. But all five are now behind bars.\par \par \uc2 'We will continue to work with registrars to tackle this issue.

\par\par \uc2 NEWS\par \b \uc2 Immigration\uc2  judges block foreign killer's deportation on 'human rights' grounds\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Barrett Home Affairs Correspondent   \par \uc2 738 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par 19:15\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Somali man convicted of manslaughter defeats bid to remove him from Britain, despite being single man with no children\par \par \uc2 A foreign killer has won the right to stay in Britain indefinitely - and keep his identity secret - after claiming his human rights would be breached if he was separated from his extended family.\par \par \uc2 The Somali man, who can only be identified by the initials MAI, was sent to prison for five years for manslaughter and has a string of other convictions, including acts of violence.\par \par \uc2 But even though he is unmarried and has no children, the 38-year-old killer claimed he could not be deported by the Home Office because it would breach his human rights to separate him from his mother, grown-up siblings, and other family.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  judges ruled that MAI would have his rights infringed under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to "private and family life".\par \par \uc2 He also claimed he would be attacked in his homeland by relatives of the man he killed, which his lawyers argued would be a further breach of human rights laws.\par \par \uc2 The judges also granted MAI anonymity, meaning he can never be publicly named.\par \par \uc2 Dominic Raab, the Conservative MP who is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10595652/New-bid-to-block-human-rights-claims-by-foreign-criminals.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 campaigning for reform of human rights legislation}}}\uc2 , said: \u8220\'20\'1CThis case highlights the perverse state of human rights law.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt can\u8217\'20\'19t be right that such a dangerous man, a convicted killer, with a string of other violent offences to his name, can frustrate his deportation so easily by claiming family ties here.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is not even a case involving children or any other dependents. Frankly, his feet shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t touch the ground.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 MAI has a long and violent criminal record. He was convicted of manslaughter of another Somali, known only by the initials FA, in 1998 at Cardiff Crown Court and jailed for five years.\par \par \uc2 After his release, in December 2004 he was convicted of affray and handed a community order, and then a nine month jail term four years later for unlawful wounding.\par \par \uc2 In February 2012 he was fined for being drunk and disorderly, and in May that year - his most recent offence - MAI was jailed for six months for common assault.\par \par \uc2 In August 2012, following his third and most recent prison term for violence, Theresa May, the Home Secretary, attempted to deport MAI on the grounds that it would be \u8220\'20\'1Cconducive to the public good\u8221\'20\'1D because of his violent history.\par \par \uc2 MAI appealed and the lower tribunal of the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  and Asylum Chamber overturned Mrs May\u8217\'20\'19s deportation order on Article 8 grounds.\par \par \uc2 MAI also claimed that he would be the target of a \u8220\'20\'1Cblood feud\u8221\'20\'1D by the family of the FA, who he killed in Cardiff in 1997, who was a member of the Somali Habr Awal tribe.\par \par \uc2 The Home Office appealed against the decision arguing the court had \u8220\'20\'1Cattributed insufficient weight to the public interest\u8221\'20\'1D and that MAI was a \u8220\'20\'1Cpersistent offender\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 But last month in the upper tribunal, Judge Nicholas Renton upheld the earlier ruling, meaning MAI cannot be deported.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe panel found that the appellant had a family life in the UK with his mother, his adult siblings, and his niece, nephew and cousins,\u8221\'20\'1D said the court ruling.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe appellant also had a private life. The panel concluded that the interference with that family and private life as a consequence of the appeallant\u8217\'20\'19s deportation was not proportionate.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn reaching that decision the panel found compelling and therefore exceptional factors in the appellant\u8217\'20\'19s favour being the fact that excluding the time spent in prison, the appellant had lived in the UK for over 20 years.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 His risk of reoffending was \u8220\'20\'1Clow\u8221\'20\'1D and he had not committed a serious offence since 2008, the court said.\par \par \uc2 Home Office spokesman said they would appeal against the decision.\par \par \uc2 A Home Office spokesman said: \u8220\'20\'1CWe firmly believe foreign nationals who break the law should be deported and we are appealing the tribunal\u8217\'20\'19s decision.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CUnder our \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Bill, those with no right to be here will not be able to prevent deportation simply by dragging out the appeals process.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Bill will reduce 17 rights of appeal to four, and give the full force of law to our policy that foreign criminals should be deported despite their claim to a family life.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140512ea5c004xt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Financial Pages\par \b \uc2 CBI 'on high alert' over house price rises: Business lobbyists expect 8% increase this year: Interest rates predicted to start climbing early in 2015\b0\par\par\uc2 Angela Monaghan   \par \uc2 705 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Britain's leading business lobby group has warned that policymakers must be ready to act on unsustainable house price rises in Britain.\par \par \uc2 The CBI said it was on high alert after annual house price inflation reached more than 10% in some areas. It now expects interest rates to rise in the first three months of 2015, six months earlier than it previously predicted and, crucially, before the general election.\par \par \uc2 John Cridland, the group's director-general, said: "We have to remain alert to the risks posed by unsustainable house price inflation, and the [\uc2 Bank of England\uc2 's] financial policy committee is poised to act when necessary.\par \par \uc2 "Housing has come back under the spotlight as annual house price inflation figures have reached double digits on some measures. While housing transactions are still running almost 30% below their last peak in 2006, they are picking up steadily."\par \par \uc2 The business lobby group is expecting house prices to rise by 8.2% this year, and by 5.1% in 2015. Prices rose 3.6% in 2013.\par \par \uc2 It raised its forecasts for economic growth this year and next, and said the recovery was becoming better balanced, with a sharp rise in business investment expected. It expects the economy to grow by 3% this year, stronger than an earlier forecast of 2.6%. Next year growth is expected to be 2.7%, compared with an earlier forecast of 2.5%.\par \par \uc2 The CBI warned that "loose talk" and anti-business rhetoric before next May's general election risked damaging investment and derailing the recovery.\par \par \uc2 "The UK now has more stable economic foundations, and political risks must not jeopardise this. Politicians must be wary of the risk of headline-grabbing policies that weaken investment, opportunity and jobs," Cridland said.\par \par \uc2 "We've got a combination of political risks that we've not had for some while. They range from UK general election to Scottish referendum on independence to the prospect of a referendum on \uc2 European Union\uc2 , so that's quite a cocktail of issues."\par \par \uc2 He said the message to all parties was to stick with what's working, including a commitment to cut the deficit.\par \par \uc2 The CBI brought forward its expectation for the first rise in interest rates to the first quarter of 2015, when it expects the first 0.25 percentage-point rise in rates. It had previously forecast that the first rise in rates would come in the third quarter of next year. Rates have been on hold at a record low of 0.5% since March 2009.\par \par \uc2 Cridland said the government's controversial Help to Buy scheme - blamed by some for creating a new housing bubble - was not responsible for unsustainable rises in house prices, arguing it was a relatively small part of the overall market.\par \par \uc2 "Help to Buy is primarily helping people outside London, on relatively modest mortgages, and appears very much still to be helping first-time buyers. Those were the CBI's core objectives."\par \par \uc2 He said it was important to remember that although London prices were 25% above the 2008 peak, in part fuelled by rich cash buyers, prices in the rest of Britain were still 2% lower.\par \par \uc2 The CBI chief said bold action was needed to address the chronic shortage of houses in the UK, so that supply had a chance of keeping up with demand. The CBI wants to see councils releasing more land, and the possibility of new garden cities to be explored by policymakers.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, \uc2 Katja Hall\uc2 , the CBI's chief policy director, said the warning on anti-business policies was meant for all parties, but admitted Labour's pledge to freeze energy prices and the hard line on banks were concerns.\par \par \uc2 "Political positioning must not be allowed to stifle investment, whether it's an unrealistic \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  target, unjustified interventions into specific markets, flirting with leaving the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , delaying vital long-term infrastructure projects or restricting labour market flexibility."\par \par \uc2 Caption:\par \par \uc2 Prices in London are 25% above the 2008 peak but in the rest of Britain they are 2% lower, said CBI chief\par \par \uc2 John Cridland\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140512ea5c00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NEWS\par \b \uc2 EU elections 2014: Is \uc2 immigration\uc2  good for Britain?\b0\par\par\uc2 By James Kirkup Political Editor   \par \uc2 3,226 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par 15:46\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The Telegraph\u8217\'20\'19s political editor James Kirkup examines how the town and society of Llanelli has coped with an influx of European migrants and how its story mirrors that of the UK\par \par \uc2 After a lifetime in the construction industry in south Wales, \uc2 George Parker\uc2  is a plain-spoken man, happy to call a spade and spade and a hydraulic earthmover a digger.\par \par \uc2 But on one subject, he picks his words with some delicacy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI have to be a bit careful, you know?\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Mr Parker, 55, is talking about his decision to give British jobs to foreign workers.\par \par \uc2 He runs Parker Plant Hire, a firm he founded in Llanelli with his father in 1981. He employs 60 people on two sites, and counts some of the biggest public companies in Wales as customers.\par \par \uc2 Six of Mr Parker\u8217\'20\'19s 60 staff are Polish. Some are doing jobs that used to be done by British workers: \u8220\'20\'1CThe jobs the Polish lads are doing, we used to have Welsh boys doing it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Parker\u8217\'20\'19s Poles are a small part of a great tide of humanity, numbered in the millions, that has delivered probably the biggest change in the British population in the country\u8217\'20\'19s modern history.\par \par \uc2 In the first decade of this century, net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to Britain \u8211\'20\'13 the balance of people arriving over those leaving \u8211\'20\'13 averaged just under 200,000 a year. In the 1990s, it was around 50,000. In the 1980s, less than 10,000. Even during the upheaval of the years from 1931 to 1951, net migration ran at around 25,000 people a year.\par \par \uc2 Britain\u8217\'20\'19s membership of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 European Union}}}\uc2  is an indivisible part of this \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  story.\par \par \uc2 " {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-the-functioning-of-the-european-union-and-comments/part-3-union-policies-and-internal-actions/title-iv-free-movement-of-persons-services-and-capital/chapter-1-workers/187-article-45.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the Union}}}\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D says the basic treaty of the EU. Being in the club means opening your borders to all of its citizens, a population that now passes 500 million.\par \par \uc2 LOOK EAST\par \par \uc2 Just over a decade ago, on 1 May, 2004, the EU changed forever, and as a consequence, Britain did too. The EU expanded to the east and took in 10 new member states with a combined population of almost 75 million, almost all of them poorer than their fellow Europeans to the west.\par \par \uc2 Unlike other western states, Britain chose not to restrict the entry of the Poles, the Czechs and others. They were free to come to this country.\par \par \uc2 Long-Term International Migration estimates from the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  suggest that around 713,000 Eastern Europeans came to the UK between 2004 and 2012. However, even the ONS admits that is almost certainly an underestimate, and most analysts put the total closer to 1 million.\par \par \uc2 They joined an already significant European population in Britain. The 2011 Census recorded that 2.7 million residents of the UK were born elsewhere in the EU. Of those, 1.1 million were from the new eastern member states.\par \par \uc2 When countries like Germany and France finally opened their borders and labour markets to the east, there were predictions that the flow of newcomers to the UK would slow.\par \par \uc2 That didn\u8217\'20\'19t happen. Last year, 209,0000 EU nationals came to the UK, up from 149,000 in 2012. Indeed EU arrivals helped push last year\u8217\'20\'19s net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  figure to 212,000, shredding David Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s pledge to reduce it to \u8220\'20\'1Ctens of thousands\u8221\'20\'1D before next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election.\par \par \uc2 Economic turmoil in western Europe helped push up that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 : the numbers of Spaniards, Italians and Portuguese registering for National Insurance numbers all rose sharply. But most of the new arrivals were Poles: 111,000 in all, a 39 per cent rise in a year.\par \par \uc2 Other factors are at play too. A socialist government in France has helped give London a substantial French population, many of them bankers fleeing high tax rates.\par \par \uc2 In the London districts of South Kensington and Clapham, French is spoken almost as commonly as English; both have heavily oversubscribed French-language schools.\par \par \uc2 The arrival of French financiers causes little controversy, since few politicians see votes in campaigning for British jobs for British bankers.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere though, the labour market effects of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  are of profound political importance.\par \par \uc2 Probably the biggest of the many questions raised by the arrival of EU citizens in Britain is this: do European \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  take jobs from British people?\par \par \uc2 If you listen to the UK Independence Party, the answer is a clear \u8220\'20\'1CYes.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The party has based its campaign for next week\u8217\'20\'19s election on the premise that bringing more European workers into Britain is bad for British workers.\par \par \uc2 Between the end of 1996 and the end of 2012, the number of European nationals employed in the UK rose from 420,000 to 1.45 million. That rise, of 1.03 million, was just short of the 1.1 million increase in UK nationals\u8217\'20\'19 employment.\par \par \uc2 The ONS\u8217\'20\'19s Labour Force Survey also suggests that European arrivals are more likely to be in work than Britons: EU visitors have an employment rate of 77.2 per cent, compared to 72.4 per cent for natives.\par \par \uc2 In Llanelli, does Mr Parker believe that the Polish arrivals have cost British workers their jobs? Quite the contrary, he says, offering a real-world story of the textbook economic theory that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  increases productivity, growth and employment.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Poles, their work is outstanding. The pride they take in it is amazing, a credit to them and their country. The way they look after a machine, it looks better and we get more use out of it. We spend less money and we do more business, and then we hire more people.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Government, for all Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s rhetoric, takes a similar view, albeit more quietly. \uc2 HM Treasury\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s basic statistical model for predicting economic activity still includes 0.25 percentage points of growth that wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be there without \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s an official, if tacit, admission that the arrival in the UK of predominantly young and industrious migrants makes the UK economy bigger.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, it also makes the population bigger. And some, like the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, would say that there\u8217\'20\'19s no point baking a bigger cake if you only have to cut it into more slices.\par \par \uc2 Some economists say \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  means healthier public finances too: the Treasury\u8217\'20\'19s Office for Budget Responsibility notes that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are more likely to be of working age, more likely to pay taxes and less likely to need to have money spent on them for education, health care and pension.\par \par \uc2 According to \uc2 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\uc2 , an international think-tank, the overall effect of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is that the \uc2 British Government\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s deficit is at least \u163\'00\'A37 billion a year smaller than it would otherwise be. That\u8217\'20\'19s money that would otherwise have to be found from higher taxes or lower spending.\par \par \uc2 Still, generating wealth and growth is one thing. Distributing it is quite another.\par \par \uc2 Politicians from all the parties fret that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  enriches employers and the better-off, but impoverishes low-skilled, low-paid Britons. As Ed Miliband put it in 2012, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was good for people who wanted a cheap conservatory, bad for people who build conservatories.\par \par \uc2 The economic evidence here is cloudy at best.\par \par \uc2 In the hope of shedding some light, the Home Office and the Department for Business this year carried out a comprehensive review of that evidence. Its conclusions were mixed, and cautious.\par \par \uc2 In essence, it found some evidence that non-European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  costs British workers jobs, but only in two years during the recent recession, 2009 and 2010.\par \par \uc2 As for the European arrivals, Whitehall\u8217\'20\'19s definitive search found \u8220\'20\'1Clittle evidence so far in the literature of a statistically significant impact from EU migration on native employment.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 What about wages? A lot of people suspect \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  pushes down wages. Again, the economic evidence is mixed. Few studies have offered firm evidence that wages fall, and some have found that average pay levels actually rise along with \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 albeit with the benefits more clearly felt by higher-skilled workers.\par \par \uc2 In Llanelli, Mr Parker cannot easily be accused of driving down wages to cut costs: his firm has achieved a rare gold standard in the Government\u8217\'20\'19s Investors in People scheme. He says he pays his Polish workers as much as their Welsh counterparts.\par \par \uc2 And he insists that none of his Welsh workers were dismissed to make way for his Polish staff. Instead, some locals chose not to work: \u8220\'20\'1CLet\u8217\'20\'19s put it this way: some people decide they don\u8217\'20\'19t need to work to have a nice life \u8211\'20\'13 benefits, you know?\par \par \uc2 Such views can cause local offence, but Mr Parker is in good company.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron has acknowledged that the welfare system gives some Britons an economic incentive to stay out of work. He\u8217\'20\'19s also admitted that an underperforming education system means some young Britons are \u8220\'20\'1Cnot fully capable\u8221\'20\'1D of competing in the job market against European rivals.\par \par \uc2 IT\u8217\'20\'19S THE SOCIETY, STUPID\par \par \uc2 Of course, economics is only one facet of the European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate. Even people who believe \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  brings economic benefits can accept that it can also have social consequences and costs. After all, the sudden arrival of large numbers of outsiders in any community would almost inevitably mean disruption.\par \par \uc2 So it was in Llanelli. The town and its nearby villages have a population of around 80,000. In recent years, as many as 5,000 Poles and other Europeans have arrived.\par \par \uc2 Many work at the Crosshands Food Park, a cluster of food processing plants north of the town centre and part of an industry that relies on foreign labour: 41 per cent of all food processing workers are \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the early years after 2004, a lot of the new arrivals were young and single and most spoke poor or no English. Keri Thomas, a Labour member of \uc2 Carmarthenshire Council\uc2  for a ward in central Llanelli, said that led to problems in his community.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey were bringing people into town, they weren\u8217\'20\'19t vetting them. They couldn\u8217\'20\'19t speak English, they didn\u8217\'20\'19t have anywhere to live. They were bringing in the people the country doesn\u8217\'20\'19t need. Some of them had criminal records. They were horrible.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Such was the local unease over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  that in 2008, the British National Party won a seat on the community council in Llandybie in the Amman Valley above Llanelli, something almost unheard of in Left-leaning Wales.\par \par \uc2 The following year, the trend continued nationwide. The BNP won two seats in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For Vanessa Marsh and other residents of Cllr Thomas\u8217\'20\'19s Tyisha ward, it all got too much.\par \par \uc2 She helped found the Safer Community Action Group, a group of volunteers intent on tackling modern Llanelli\u8217\'20\'19s social problems, including some associated with \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CA lot of them were single males who seem to think it is acceptable to drink all day in the streets, and urinate and leave their rubbish around,\u8221\'20\'1D she says. \u8220\'20\'1CIt reached such a place that we decided we had to do something about it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Such complaints are not unique to Llanelli. Several police forces and MPs have reported similar problems of anti-social behaviour linked the arrival of largely young, single male migrants.\par \par \uc2 Across the UK, other newcomers are responsible for more serious transgressions, with drink-driving and violence especially prevalent.\par \par \uc2 There are almost 1,000 Poles in jail in England and Wales, more than 1 per cent of the total prison population.\par \par \uc2 The Llanelli residents\u8217\'20\'19 response, developed with local police, was a \u8220\'20\'1Cdesignated public places order\u8221\'20\'1D covering much of the town centre, allowing officers to confiscate alcohol from people drinking in public and impose immediate fines.\par \par \uc2 Notices telling residents of the new rules were posted in shop windows, the warnings printed in three languages: English, Welsh and Polish. According to Mrs Marsh, the change is working: drink-related trouble is down, and residents are happier.\par \par \uc2 Aged 67, she has lived in Llanelli since birth, and seen the town change a lot in the last decade. Is she unhappy at the arrival of her European neighbours? She says not.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe world is always changing, that\u8217\'20\'19s just a fact of life. None of us has a problem with the Polish community \u8211\'20\'13 they are hardworking, family-orientated people. Most of them don\u8217\'20\'19t want to be associated with the problems either.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Cllr Thomas agrees, saying Llanelli has \u8220\'20\'1Cturned a corner\u8221\'20\'1D and describing the town\u8217\'20\'19s Poles today as \u8220\'20\'1Ca credit to the community.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 As a Labour politician, what does he think of his party\u8217\'20\'19s decision to allow Eastern Europeans free access to Britain in 2004?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt was wrong, it was a mistake. It put a burden on services, on the GPs and the hospitals and the schools. It still does, but we\u8217\'20\'19re coping. We are coping, but it is a burden.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  undoubtedly means spending more on public services, though just how much is highly uncertain.\par \par \uc2 According to a Department of Health study last year, short-term European migrants consume \u163\'00\'A3261 million worth of \uc2 NHS\uc2  services each year. A \uc2 European Commission\uc2  report suggests UK health spending on \u8220\'20\'1Cnon-active\u8221\'20\'1D EU migrants is more like \u163\'00\'A31.5 billion.\par \par \uc2 On the other side of the coin, \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are essential to providing those services. Some 26 per cent of health professionals in the UK are \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As for education, the National Audit Office last year estimated that England is short of more than 250,000 primary school places, a shortage that leaves many parents unable to send their children to their chosen schools. The NAO said that some \u8211\'20\'13 but not all \u8211\'20\'13 of that shortage is down to higher migration, as some migrants bring children to Britain, while others start families here.\par \par \uc2 The presence of foreign-born children in British schools can be emotive, not least since it produces schools where many pupils do not speak English as their first language. The majority of children in 1,755 English primary and secondary schools - almost a tenth of the total \u8211\'20\'13 have English as a second language.\par \par \uc2 But the consequences of linguistic diversity often confound the fears of critics. Many polyglot schools have high ratings from school inspectors. Last year, the Centre for Economic Performance, a think-tank, found that the arrival of Polish children in British schools had helped lift their native classmates\u8217\'20\'19 results. The researchers said one explanation is that Polish children\u8217\'20\'19s stronger work ethic encourages their British peers.\par \par \uc2 COMING, AND STAYING?\par \par \uc2 While the Poles are the most numerous of the new arrivals, it is more recent migrants \u8211\'20\'13 and potential migrants \u8211\'20\'13 who tend to attract the most attention.\par \par \uc2 Cllr Thomas says he worried about the next phase of European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Since January, Romanians and Bulgarians have also had free access to Britain and its labour market.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Poles we\u8217\'20\'19ve got are good, but it\u8217\'20\'19ll be those Romanians next and that\u8217\'20\'19ll be a problem.\u8221\'20\'1D Are there many Romanians in Llanelli? \u8220\'20\'1CNo. But they could come here. They\u8217\'20\'19re perfectly entitled to, as long as we\u8217\'20\'19re in Europe.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Fear of the unknown, and acceptance of the familiar, are common features of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  experience: the more direct experience of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  someone has, the more likely they are to accept it.\par \par \uc2 A Survation/Sky News poll in November found that 71 per cent of people who don\u8217\'20\'19t know any \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  well want \u8220\'20\'1Cdrastic action\u8221\'20\'1D to cut \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Among those who know \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  well, the figure drops to 58 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps, just perhaps, more \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  will mean more acceptance, though those figures remain high: plainly, Britain is unhappy about the arrival of so many newcomers.\par \par \uc2 Will that unhappiness persist? The Europeans are hardly the first big \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  group to come to Britain. In living memory, the country has seen the arrival of people from India and Pakistan following Indian independence, from Uganda following Idi Amin\u8217\'20\'19s pogroms, and from the Caribbean aboard ships like the Empire Windrush.\par \par \uc2 None of those groups was anywhere near as large as the new European population, but each changed the country profoundly, by becoming part of it.\par \par \uc2 On the front benches of both the Conservative and Labour Parties are men of such heritage who can plausibly be described as potential prime ministers: Sajid Javid, the son of a Pakistani bus driver, and Chuka Umunna, the son of a Nigerian businessman. Will Polish Britons eventually become part of our national make-up in the same way?\par \par \uc2 The extent and nature of the changes brought about by European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  will depend in part on how many of the recent arrivals stay. Many are transitory migrants whose temporary presence here depends on economic circumstance: they earn and save, then leave for home, or another country with higher wages, especially Germany. In 2012, some 75,000 European nationals left the UK, 30,000 of them from the east.\par \par \uc2 But others will stay, putting down roots, raising families, becoming a permanent part of the country.\par \par \uc2 Radek Tuczynsky, 37, came to Llanelli from western Poland seven years ago. He knows exactly how much longer he\u8217\'20\'19ll be here: \u8220\'20\'1CAnother 24 years \u8211\'20\'13 that\u8217\'20\'19s when I\u8217\'20\'19ll have paid off the mortgage.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Tuczynsky works for Parker Plant building portable accommodation blocks, skilled technical work his boss says he does well. In his time in Wales, he says he\u8217\'20\'19s never experienced hostility from the locals, and gets along happily with his Welsh colleagues and neighbours.\par \par \uc2 Still, he says he understands why \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  sometimes leads to tensions, especially when it comes to his transitory compatriots.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSome of them live poor lives here, they just take the money back to Poland, they don\u8217\'20\'19t settle. I can see why people have a problem with them.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He is not that sort of migrant, he suggests.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLast year, I bought a house. I have a mortgage here. I pay taxes here. In seven years, I\u8217\'20\'19ve never taken benefits. The \uc2 British Government\uc2  has given me nothing and that\u8217\'20\'19s fine. I just want to work.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Settling down may ease social tensions, but ironically, becoming \u8220\'20\'1Cnormal\u8221\'20\'1D Britons will eventually make European \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  less economically useful to their adopted home. Those that stay will age and require health care and pensions, and have children who must be educated. A \uc2 University College London\uc2  study last year found that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who arrived in the Eighties and Nineties, then stayed and had children, now pay in only 85p for every \u163\'00\'A31 of public services they consume.\par \par \uc2 That remains some way off for the new \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , however.\par \par \uc2 For now, the UCL figures suggest recent European arrivals are young and industrious, contributing a third more in taxes than they receive in services.\par \par \uc2 Mr Tuczynsky and his partner, a dental nurse, have a young daughter. They need more space at home, so they\u8217\'20\'19re converting the garage into a bedroom.\par \par \uc2 Since he tends to work seven days a week, Mr Tuczynsky doesn\u8217\'20\'19t have the time to do the work himself. So he hired builders. And where are those builders from?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey\u8217\'20\'19re Welsh builders, Welsh boys. They\u8217\'20\'19re reliable, they do a good job. I used them once before. I want someone reliable, so I get people I know.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/european-elections-the-immigrants/index.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 What does Europe think of us?}}}\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140512ea5c00105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FINANCE\par \b \uc2 Earlier rate rise may be needed, warns CBI\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rebecca Burn-Callander  \par \uc2 670 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par 13:48\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.  \par \par \uc2 The Bank of England may need to raise interest rates before May's general election, six months earlier than predicted, amid fears of a housing bubble\par \par \uc2 Interest rates may need to rise sooner than expected to offset the impact of the UK\u8217\'20\'19s overheating housing market as the economy\u8217\'20\'19s growth accelerates, business leaders have said.\par \par \uc2 London house prices have risen 25pc on their 2008 high, fueling speculation of a bubble. While housing transactions are currently running at 30pc below their 2006 peak and, nationwide, prices remain around 2pc down on 2006, the market is picking up pace. Property prices are set to increase by 8.2pc this year and 5.1pc in 2015.\par \par \uc2 According to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), this could force the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the first three months of next year, before the general election, as opposed to the third quarter previously forecast.\par \par \uc2 This has been echoed by economists, who claim that Bank governor Mark Carney will confirm interest rises on Wednesday, when the bank lifts its growth forecasts as part of its scheduled inflation report.\par \par \uc2 The CBI upgraded its GDP predictions from 2.6pc to 3pc for 2014 in its growth forecast, released today. Next year, the economy will expand by 2.7pc, rather than the 2.5pc previously forecast, it added.\par \par \uc2 While the growth is encouraging, the CBI said that a housing bubble could still derail the recovery. \u8220\'20\'1CWe have to remain alert to the risks posed by unsustainable house price inflation,\u8221\'20\'1D said CBI director-general John Cridland. \u8220\'20\'1CHousing has come back under the spotlight as annual house price inflation figures have reached double digit figures on some measures.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 His comments follow last week\u8217\'20\'19s warning from economic thinktank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which said that if measures were not taken to further \u8220\'20\'1Crestrain housing demand\u8221\'20\'1D, such as cutting back the Government\u8217\'20\'19s Help to Buy scheme or forcing borrowers raise higher deposits, the market could quickly overheat.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cridland also voiced fears that the imminent general election could see business investment and tough decisions take a back seat to political electioneering.\par \par \uc2 In a thinly-veiled reference to Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s promise to freeze energy prices last year, he said: \u8220\'20\'1CBusinesses recognise the realities of election time but want all parties to ensure their policies make a positive difference. Politicians must be wary of the risk of headline-grabbing policies that weaken investment, opportunity and jobs.\par \par \uc2 "The UK now has more stable economic foundations," he added. "Political risks must not jeopardise this."\par \par \uc2 The CBI has called for all parties to focus on reforming public services, boosting the supply of new homes, reducing the deficit and investing in UK infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Unrealistic \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  targets, unjustified interventions into various markets, further flirtations with leaving the EU, and any lever-pulling which could delay long-term infrastructure projects or restrict labour market flexibility must be avoided if the business community is to continue to flourish, it said.\par \par \uc2 A slew of economic data, released today, confirmed that the UK economy is thriving. According to the latest Business Trends report from accountancy firm BDO, UK manufacturers\u8217\'20\'19 growth prospects for the rest of 2014 strengthened in April as confidence within the sector rose to a new all-time high.\par \par \uc2 The increased confidence in the manufacturing sector is evidence of economic rebalancing, as power shifts away from the London and City-centric services industry.\par \par \uc2 The latest Lloyds Bank Regional Purchasing Managers\u8217\'20\'19 Index (PMI) also revealed further strong improvement in business conditions across England and Wales, with manufacturers and service providers taking on more staff and reporting strong rises in their order books.\par \par \uc2 Across the English regions, the seasonally adjusted index measuring overall business activity reached 59.3 in April, up from 58.1 in March and well above the 50.0 value that indicates no change. This was the strongest monthly rise in business activity since December 2013.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140512ea5c0008g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

Politicians must be wary of the risk of headline-grabbing policies that weaken investment, opportunity and jobs.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The CBI now expects unemployment to drop to two million by the end of next year.

He\u8217\'20\'19s somebody of 70 years of age who grew up with a strong Christian Bible background.\par \par \uc2 "He grew up in an age when homosexuality was actually imprisonable, and he had a certain set of views which he maintained for many years which he now says he accepts the world\u8217\'20\'19s moved on and he\u8217\'20\'19s relaxed about.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAnd actually, if we asked the 70s and over in this country how they felt about it, most of them still feel uncomfortable.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere are a lot of people in this country who are disconcerted by the change in the traditional meaning of marriage, and I think in a tolerant society we understand that some people have different views.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Helmer has said he now accepts gay marriage and told the Guardian last week he had modified his views after "catching the zeitgeist".\par \par \uc2 Ukip's views on same-sex marriage are somewhat blurred and Farage recently retracted a statement from his party saying it would not repeal the Marriage Act of 2013.\par \par \uc2 Ukip candidate Winston McKenzie, 60, recently said the party is not racist, but he thinks gay adoption is "child abuse".\par \par \uc2 Douglas Denny, 66, a Ukip candidate in Portsmouth, recently said gay sex is "disgusting" and that gays are "abnormal".\par \par \uc2 During the Sunday Politics show Farage was keen not to talk about individual candidates but the European election which he believes will prove to be "interesting".\par \par \uc2 Related articles Protestor who egged Ukip leader Nigel Farage charged with assault Oops!

\par\par \uc2 CULTURE\par \b \uc2 Sigrid Rausing on money, addiction and collective farming\b0\par\par\uc2 By Mick Brown   \par \uc2 3,793 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par 11:41\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Sigrid Rausing, owner of the Granta publishing house and one of Britain's richest women, says that with great wealth comes great responsibility\par \par \uc2 Sigrid Rausing is one of the wealthiest women in Britain. Quite how wealthy, she declines to say. \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19m not telling you,\u8217\'20\'19 she says firmly when you ask \u8211\'20\'13 knowing even as you do that she will find the question tiresome, presumptuous and, though she is much too polite to say so, vulgar. Rausing is a philanthropist, a human rights activist, and the owner of the publishing house Granta and its literary magazine of the same name. As the benefactor of one of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s largest private charitable trusts she is responsible for the dispensation of some \u163\'00\'A322 million a year.\par \par \uc2 There are two things that everybody knows about the Rausing family. One is that most of us have in some small way contributed to the considerable Rausing fortune. Sigrid\u8217\'20\'19s grandfather Ruben was a food-packaging manufacturer who in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9390214/Tetra-Pak-How-a-carton-took-over-the-world.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 1950s developed the Tetra Pak}}}\uc2 , the watertight cardboard container for storing milk and fruit juice that is to be found in virtually every refrigerator in the land. Ruben\u8217\'20\'19s sons, Gad and Hans \u8211\'20\'13 Sigrid\u8217\'20\'19s father \u8211\'20\'13 inherited the business, turning Tetra Pak into the largest food-packaging company in the world.\par \par \uc2 The second thing is that the family fortune has provided no immunity to tragedy. In July 2012 Sigrid\u8217\'20\'19s younger brother, Hans Kristian, was arrested on suspicion of possessing Class A drugs. Searching his home in Belgravia, London, police found the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9392206/Money-and-drugs-the-lethal-cocktail-for-Eva-Rausing.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 decomposing body of his wife, Eva}}}\uc2 , in an upstairs room where it had lain for two months, behind a locked door, after Eva had died of a heart attack. The couple, it transpired, had fought a long and failing battle against drug addiction.\par \par \uc2 The chequered mosaic of the Rausing family provides an easy template for speculation about the mixed blessings of extreme wealth. But what Sigrid Rausing is concerned with right now is the slush pile in the offices of Granta \u8211\'20\'13 the mound of unsolicited manuscripts that arrive at publishers, and which is usually left to minions to deal with.\par \par \uc2 Last year Granta found itself embroiled in a tempestuous period \u8211\'20\'13 described by one employee as \u8216\'20\'18a total shit storm\u8217\'20\'19 \u8211\'20\'13 that resulted in the number of staff being cut by a third and Rausing emerging as not only the publisher of the magazine but also its editor. In her new role she has been methodically ploughing through the slush pile. \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19m very committed to the idea of Granta publishing unknown writers alongside known writers,\u8217\'20\'19 she says. \u8216\'20\'18And so I feel it\u8217\'20\'19s necessary to read every piece. It is a reflection of my feelings about people\u8217\'20\'19s access to the cultural institutions that people could reach us.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Rausing gives interviews rarely. Serious-minded, with the quiet, earnest demeanour of the academic that she once imagined she would become, there is nothing the least bit frivolous about her. Nor is there anything in the least ostentatious. There is no trace of make-up on her pleasant, smiling face. Her brown, resolutely unstyled hair is being allowed to go naturally grey.\par \par \uc2 Rausing is 52. Her husband is Eric Abraham, a South African-born film producer who is best known for producing the Academy Award-winning Kolya, which won Best Foreign Language Film in 1996, whom she married in 2003. She has a teenage son by a previous marriage, to Dennis Hotz, a South African publisher and art dealer.\par \par \uc2 Rausing has three homes. There is Aubrey House in London, a spectacularly beautiful Georgian mansion, tucked away behind a high wall in Holland Park, which she bought in 1998 for a reported \u163\'00\'A320 million, and which is said to have the second largest private garden in London after Buckingham Palace. \u8216\'20\'18Well, so they say, but who knows really? I don\u8217\'20\'19t know if it has ever been measured.\u8217\'20\'19 She loves the garden, but as to gardening, \u8216\'20\'18I can\u8217\'20\'19t bend down. I have a back problem.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 There is a farm in Sussex, which she regards as the proper family home, and where she spends much of her time, walking her three dogs. \u8216\'20\'18I love to walk. I need to walk.\u8217\'20\'19 Her sister, Lisbet, who is also a noted philanthropist, lives nearby; as does their father, Hans, who is now 88, and lives on an estate described by its architect as \u8216\'20\'18a palace\u8217\'20\'19, and who, according to an article in Tatler, gets his hair cut at the local barber and has been known to ask for the OAP discount.\par \par \uc2 Sigrid Rausing also owns a 40,000-acre estate in the Monadhliath mountains in the Scottish Highlands, from where she waged a long but unsuccessful battle against the plans of her neighbour the Bahamas-based multi-millionaire Sir Jack Hayward to install 33 wind turbines on his Dunmaglass estate. What she prefers to call \u8216\'20\'18wind power stations\u8217\'20\'19 in \u8216\'20\'18wild areas\u8217\'20\'19 are a particular b\u234\'00\'EAte noire of Rausing\u8217\'20\'19s. \u8216\'20\'18It\u8217\'20\'19s a form of industrialisation,\u8217\'20\'19 she says, \u8216\'20\'18but because it\u8217\'20\'19s supposed to be \u8220\'20\'1Cgreen\u8221\'20\'1D people describe it as something other than what it is. I like things to be described as what they are. If we are content with industrialising the Highlands and the wild landscapes of Britain, then let\u8217\'20\'19s have wind farms \u8211\'20\'13 but we must be aware it means widening narrow roads, it means pylons everywhere, and it means an uncertain power supply as well. So I am not sure that, cradle-to-grave, that form of energy is particularly \u8220\'20\'1Cgreen\u8221\'20\'1D if you take everything into account.\u8217\'20\'19 This short peroration \u8211\'20\'13 softly spoken, understated but at the same time unequivocal \u8211\'20\'13 seems typical of Rausing.\par \par \uc2 We are talking at the offices of Granta, a row of converted shopfronts in west London. There are shiny wooden floorboards, glass walls, chic, ergonomic leather chairs. Rausing first entered the world of publishing in 2005 when along with her husband she founded a small publisher, Portobello Books (at the same time, Abraham founded his own film production company, Portobello Films). Later that year Rausing acquired Granta Books, and the literary journal Granta, from Rea Hederman, who also owned the New York Review of Books. Under Rausing\u8217\'20\'19s tenure, and the direction of its publishing executive Philip Gwyn Jones, Granta Books went from strength to strength: last year the company won the Man Booker Prize for the first time with The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton, and also the Women\u8217\'20\'19s Prize (formerly the Orange Prize and now the Bailey\u8217\'20\'19s), also for the first time, with AM Homes\u8217\'20\'19s May We Be Forgiven. All in all more than a dozen books were shortlisted for different prizes. At the same time Granta, the magazine, consolidated its reputation, largely established in the 1980s by the editor Bill Buford, as the pre-eminent platform for literary writing and as an important arbiter of contemporary fiction through its 10-yearly list of the best of young British novelists.\par \par \uc2 This serene progress was rudely interrupted last year by a massive upheaval that resulted in the departure of Gwyn Jones and John Freeman, the American editor of the magazine, along with a number of other staff \u8211\'20\'13 an exodus that saw the number of the Granta team reduced from 34 to 24, and led to speculation in literary circles about whether Rausing was losing the plot.\par \par \uc2 Rausing smoothes over the event. The changes, she says, were prompted by her decision to restructure sales in the book division, making two people redundant, which resulted in \u8216\'20\'18a much bigger wave of \u8220\'20\'1Ccorrection\u8221\'20\'1D in the Jonathan Franzen sense\u8217\'20\'19, with people leaving. At the same time, costs on the magazine, which has a circulation of 30-50,000 around the world, were \u8216\'20\'18spiralling out of control\u8217\'20\'19 (she declines to say by how much).\par \par \uc2 Following the departures, Rausing took over full executive control of the company, becoming the publisher of Granta Books and the acting editor of the magazine (a position she has formalised). So was this really a question all along, I ask, of Rausing being Roman Abramovich but wanting to be Jos\u233\'00\'E9 Mourinho? She looks baffled. The chairman wanting to pick and manage the team\u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Well, it is much more involving, more interesting, and more fun to be the editor of the magazine than to be the publisher,\u8217\'20\'19 she says. \u8216\'20\'18But I didn\u8217\'20\'19t know that.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Rausing grew up in the quiet university town of Lund. By Swedish standards, her life was an opulent one. \u8216\'20\'18There were a handful of wealthy families in Sweden and we were one of them,\u8217\'20\'19 she says. \u8216\'20\'18Wealth is socially distorting \u8211\'20\'13 as, of course, is poverty. It\u8217\'20\'19s hard to see that when you grow up with it \u8211\'20\'13 what seems normal to you is not necessarily normal to other people. I wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t say I felt guilty \u8211\'20\'13 there was no poverty as such in Sweden \u8211\'20\'13 but I certainly felt different.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Her parents, she says, were \u8216\'20\'18completely uninterested\u8217\'20\'19 in money. Her father was passionately interested in technology, and was himself an inventor; her mother was an academic who taught medieval German at the university in Lund. \u8216\'20\'18So money was never the focus for us.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 In 1982 her father moved his family to Britain to avoid Sweden\u8217\'20\'19s punitive tax rate. His brother, Gad, and his family also acquired a home in Britain. By 1993 the two brothers were heading the Sunday Times rich list as Britain\u8217\'20\'19s wealthiest men. Two years later Hans sold his share of the business to his elder brother for \u163\'00\'A34.9 billion. Gad died in 2000.\par \par \uc2 Sigrid had first come to England in 1980, to attend St Clare\u8217\'20\'19s, a sixth-form college in Oxford. She went on to study history at the \uc2 University of York\uc2 , and, with a view to becoming an anthropologist, took a PhD at \uc2 University College London\uc2 . To complete her anthropological fieldwork, in 1993 Rausing spent a year living on a collective farm in a remote area of Estonia, studying the effect of Soviet rule and its aftermath. Her thesis, History, Memory, and Identity in Post-Soviet Estonia, was published by Oxford University Press in 2004. She has now written a book on her experiences, Everything Is Wonderful. (There is no suggestion of vanity publishing: the book is being published by Grove Atlantic, not Granta.)\par \par \uc2 Rausing\u8217\'20\'19s interest in Estonia had initially been spiked by hearing stories of the large number of Estonian Swedes who had fled to Sweden when Estonia was occupied by Germany in 1941; those who remained behind were widely tainted as \u8216\'20\'18Nazis\u8217\'20\'19 \u8211\'20\'13 a taint that was in turn eclipsed when Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1944, presaging the long, harsh Soviet rule of the country that finally came to an end in 1991, when Estonia regained its independence.\par \par \uc2 Arriving at the former Lenin Collective Farm \u8211\'20\'13 a \u8216\'20\'18broken, dirt-poor community where people were leaving every week on rickety Soviet lorries for some new future somewhere else\u8217\'20\'19 \u8211\'20\'13 Rausing took a room in a house with a drunken landlord and his long-suffering wife and set about gathering data and writing long reports: \u8216\'20\'18Sanity and Representativeness\u8217\'20\'19, \u8216\'20\'18Silence and Distance\u8217\'20\'19 and \u8216\'20\'18Transience and the Extraordinary Variety of Breakfasts\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 In the book she depicts a place where food is scarce, the heating never works, and where large swaths of the population are determinedly drinking themselves to death. Smiling at strangers is greeted with a stony indifference; when Rausing starts asking questions about life under the Soviets some people immediately suspect that she is a spy.\par \par \uc2 Everything Is Wonderful is an intriguing portrait of a society in transition \u8211\'20\'13 once the westernmost part of the Eastern bloc, now the easternmost part of the Western one \u8211\'20\'13 where people are struggling to forget the immediate past while seizing on symbols of what is thought to constitute a new \u8216\'20\'18normal\u8217\'20\'19 \u8211\'20\'13 which is to say Western \u8211\'20\'13 life: washing powder that costs two days\u8217\'20\'19 wages, Michael Jackson records and, bizarrely, the opening of a topless car wash in Tallinn (Rausing did not actually visit this). \u8216\'20\'18They\u8217\'20\'19d lived through the stagnating years of the Soviet Union, with a functioning, if impoverished, welfare system, with doctors and nurses, a nursery for the children, a free collective dining room \u8211\'20\'13 but all of that had gone,\u8217\'20\'19 Rausing says. \u8216\'20\'18So the harshness I saw that year was new for them as well \u8211\'20\'13 and much harsher because they had no sense of how long it might take them to come out of that. They really could not have predicted how quickly that process would happen, how well Estonia was to do, and how soon.\u8217\'20\'19 (The country now stands 33rd in the United Nations Human Development Index; the UK ranks 26th.)\par \par \uc2 Everything Is Wonderful is a book that, in many ways, says as much about Sigrid Rausing as it does about Estonia: a less hardy and more materialistic soul might have thrown in the towel long before her year\u8217\'20\'19s stay was over. \u8216\'20\'18I was there out of my own free will, but sometimes it felt like a sentence,\u8217\'20\'19 she writes, noting the daily round of her stay in the village with a lugubrious attention to detail. \u8216\'20\'18I went home, depressed, to read Freud\u8217\'20\'19s \u8216\'20\'18Dora\u8217\'20\'19 case study\u8230\'20\'26 The next day it rained steadily and I stayed inside.\u8217\'20\'19 And, \u8216\'20\'18There was cabbage soup for lunch.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 But the quality of the writing, and her ability to find beauty in the bleak landscape, and a quiet stoicism in the struggle of the villagers to make sense of their changing lives, invests the book with the haunting, poetic quality of a Bergman film. There is something about melancholia, I suggest, that she finds particularly appealing. \u8216\'20\'18Well, I am Swedish\u8230\'20\'26 Swedes like melancholy. The landscape and some of the older people I met were very marked by the war and the Soviet oppression. It was a very poignant experience for me.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Rausing had had first-hand experience of the hypocrisies of the Soviet system. In the 1970s Russia attempted to copy the Tetra Pak manufacturing process. Hans Rausing travelled to Moscow, not to demand royalties but to arrange for a team of his own engineers to improve the Russian design free of charge. \u8216\'20\'18He intensely disliked Soviet communism but he loved Russia and had a real affinity with the Russians.\u8217\'20\'19 Rausing went with him. \u8216\'20\'18It was a strange, corrupt, bizarre society, and very upsetting to see: the endless poverty, the queues, the harshness the people had to endure. And my father and I were feted with 15-course, vodka-fuelled dinners. It felt very unethical to me, even though I was only 16.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 It was her time in Estonia, she says, that focused her interest on philanthropy, and in particular on the cause of human rights. She had noticed the stark contrast between Estonian Swedes who had left the country as children, returning to visit, and their relations who had stayed behind. The Swedes were taller; they had their own teeth. The ones who had stayed behind were stiff and bent, with gaping holes in their mouths, \u8216\'20\'18raised,\u8217\'20\'19 as she writes, \u8216\'20\'18on poor food, on caution and mistrust\u8230\'20\'26 their bodies marked by \u8220\'20\'1Cbad governance\u8221\'20\'1D, that seemingly abstract concept, just as \u8220\'20\'1Cgood governance\u8221\'20\'1D was written on the bodies of the Swedes.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Human rights is a very difficult and complicated idea to communicate,\u8217\'20\'19 Rausing says, \u8216\'20\'18and not least in Britain; and I think seeing that made me understand much more clearly than I had understood before the relationship between bad governance and poverty. The people on the collective farm in Estonia were poor because they had lived under the Soviet machine; one knew that already, of course, but I understood it in a much more real and vivid way.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 In 1995, following the sale of her family\u8217\'20\'19s share in Tetra Pak, Rausing ploughed \u163\'00\'A360 million of her inheritance into a charitable trust which she established in the name of her grandparents Ruben and Elisabeth. She added a further \u163\'00\'A350 million in 2001, and two years later the trust took her name. Over the years, the Sigrid Rausing Trust has given away some \u163\'00\'A3209 million. Last year alone it dispensed \u163\'00\'A322.5 million. It now supports about 200 organisations around the world, across a variety of human rights causes, including the treatment and rehabilitation of torture victims in Uganda; LGBT rights in Moldova; sex-trafficked women in Albania; slum dwellers in Kenya; and a group combating violence against women, predominantly in the Muslim community, in Southall, London.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18The reason I\u8217\'20\'19m so interested in human rights is because I think they are the best principles we have for insuring an independent judiciary, the rule of law and a liberal market economy,\u8217\'20\'19 Rausing says. \u8216\'20\'18The implementation of the Human Rights Act by \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  judges has meant that the media in Britain has been able to frame the narrative around the idea of \u8220\'20\'1Cstop this human rights madness\u8221\'20\'1D. But I believe if you have signed to a convention you should abide by it. The arguments about Britain versus the EU are almost exactly the same as the arguments about Scotland versus Britain. \u8220\'20\'1CWhy should they be able to tell us what to do?\u8221\'20\'1D And I\u8217\'20\'19m rather for Britain, in the same way that I\u8217\'20\'19m rather for the EU.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Rausing says she is a firm believer in the maxim \u8216\'20\'18with great wealth comes great responsibility\u8217\'20\'19. \u8216\'20\'18I feel that very strongly. I didn\u8217\'20\'19t earn it. And I don\u8217\'20\'19t particularly feel that I \u8220\'20\'1Cown\u8221\'20\'1D the money, because I\u8217\'20\'19m the beneficiary of it. I\u8217\'20\'19m the guardian of it. It\u8217\'20\'19s not like owning a book. It\u8217\'20\'19s an existential condition; it\u8217\'20\'19s as real as you make it. And you make it real by taking it out and spending it. So in a sense the more I give away the wealthier I become.\u8217\'20\'19 She pauses. \u8216\'20\'18Wealth brings power, too, which is perhaps particularly distorting for women, at least in Britain \u8211\'20\'13 we don\u8217\'20\'19t quite know what to make of powerful women here. Mocking their shoes \u8211\'20\'13 Guardian irony \u8211\'20\'13 is always an option.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Rausing, one notices, is wearing a pair of sensible leather shoes, along with a fine wool sweater and a nice pair of grey flannel slacks. When I ask where she bought them, she looks momentarily thrown.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Oh God, I don\u8217\'20\'19t actually know.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Do you like to be noticed?\par \par \uc2 She laughs. \u8216\'20\'18No.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Are you extravagant?\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I don\u8217\'20\'19t think I am.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 With great wealth too \u8211\'20\'13 or so the less wealthy would like to believe \u8211\'20\'13 comes great problems. The tragedy surrounding her brother afforded Rausing a sharp personal perspective on the question of addiction as an illness that money can neither prevent nor cure. \u8216\'20\'18When addicts are either very rich, or very poor, money \u8211\'20\'13 or the lack of it \u8211\'20\'13 is seen as somehow causative,\u8217\'20\'19 she says. \u8216\'20\'18But I don\u8217\'20\'19t think for a moment it had anything to do with my brother. There are narratives that have grown up that just get repeated again and again, and they\u8217\'20\'19re partly about wealth, and partly about an idea of my father being a tyrannical or overbearing presence \u8211\'20\'13 but you know, none of that is true.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Hans became addicted to drugs shortly after leaving university, during a gap-year expedition, when with a group of friends he travelled through the Soviet Union and China before ending up in India. \u8216\'20\'18He certainly wasn\u8217\'20\'19t a hippie,\u8217\'20\'19 Rausing says. \u8216\'20\'18He was genuinely interested in exploring different cultures. But then they ended up in Goa on the beach, and on that beach they met some Italian girls, and the Italian girls gave them some heroin to smoke, and that was it. I think at various points he could have stopped it \u8211\'20\'13 but he didn\u8217\'20\'19t. So the reality is that from that moment he was an addict.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Thus began an interminable cycle of rehabs and relapses. \u8216\'20\'18It was a theme of my 20s,\u8217\'20\'19 she says. Undergoing treatment in an addiction clinic in America, he met another recovering addict, Eva Kemeny; they married in 1992. After many years, during which they were free of drugs, had four children, and donated millions of pounds to charities concerned with drug awareness and treatment, the couple relapsed. In the months leading up to Eva\u8217\'20\'19s death, they had secluded themselves in their home, resisting any attempts by their family to intervene.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18If you take large amounts of narcotic drugs you are no longer capable of feeling,\u8217\'20\'19 Rausing says. \u8216\'20\'18It\u8217\'20\'19s rather like leprosy, where you lose the feeling in your limbs. If you\u8217\'20\'19re a drug addict you bump yourself against other people all the time, and you hurt their feelings, because you have no inkling how destructive your actions are, and how people around you are screaming, overcome with anxiety and sadness, and mourning. You think of them as people who are annoyingly trying to take control of your life and stopping you taking drugs.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Every interaction with family carries within it the potential for an intervention \u8211\'20\'13 and we did many interventions, and each one was intensely threatening to Hans and Eva. So therefore they entirely isolated themselves. It was a folie \u224\'00\'E0 deux.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 While his wealth may not have contributed to his addiction, Rausing acknowledges that the \u8216\'20\'18shadow existence\u8217\'20\'19 Hans and Eva were able to lead, with a house and staff, would not have been possible without it. \u8216\'20\'18I think without that he would either have died of neglect or an overdose \u8211\'20\'13 or he would have been arrested and sent to prison.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Hans pleaded guilty to delaying the burial of the body and received a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. He emerged last year, apparently fit and well, and almost unrecognisable from the gaunt and haunted figure at the time of his arrest. Last month he announced his engagement to Julia Delves Broughton, a senior director at Christie\u8217\'20\'19s auction house, and the younger sister of the fashion stylist Isabella Blow, who took her own life seven years ago. In all the years of struggle and heartache that the family had been through, had Rausing ever dared to hope that there would be such a happy outcome?\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I had no hope,\u8217\'20\'19 she says simply. \u8216\'20\'18I don\u8217\'20\'19t think any of us did. But we are delighted. It\u8217\'20\'19s very moving to see Hans and Julia together.\u8217\'20\'19 Rausing pauses. We have been talking for almost two hours. As an author, publisher and editor, other matters are crowding her mind. She has said enough.\par \par \uc2 * Everything Is Wonderful (Grove Atlantic, \u163\'00\'A315.99) is available for \u163\'00\'A313.99 plus \u163\'00\'A31.35 p&p from Telegraph Books (0844-871 1514; {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://books.telegraph.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780802122179"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 books.telegraph.co.uk}}}\uc2  )\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/10815781/Everything-is-Wonderful-by-Sigrid-Rausing-review.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2  READ: EVERYTHING IS WONDERFUL, REVIEW }}}\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140510ea5a000mb\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 David Cameron rules out EU migrant cap despite fears over Bulgarian and Romanian influx\b0\par\par\uc2 By Macer Hall   \par \uc2 368 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par 11:38\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 CAPPING migration from EU countries was ruled out by David Cameron yesterday despite concerns that thousands of Bulgarians and Romanians are coming to Britain every month.\par \par \uc2 Official figures to be released later this week are expected to show that at least 30,000 from the two eastern European nations have arrived since work permit restrictions were removed on January 1.\par \par \uc2 The surge will take the total living in the UK from both countries to around 200,000, once non-working family members are taken into account.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 European elections 2014\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  has defended the free movement of labour in Europe, as he braces himself for new \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  figures expected to show a rise in the numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians living in Britain.\par \par \uc2 The prime minister said that he wanted to return the principle of open borders to its "original concept" rather than fundamentally altering it as part of his plans for EU reform.\par \par \uc2 "I think free movement in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  is important but it needs to be returned to the original concept which was the freedom to go and work in another country," Mr Cameron told the \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show on BBC One.\par \par \uc2 "Many British citizens go and work in other European countries; other European citizens come and work here. Freedom to apply for a job to go and work in another country is one thing, but I think what we've seen recently is something else."\par \par \uc2 He raised the prospect of imposing a minimum threshold for GDP per capita before countries joining the \uc2 European Union\uc2  qualified for full freedom of movement. Such an arrangement, he said, would be a way of avoiding the "big migratory flows" that resulted when poorer countries, such as Poland, joined the union.\par \par \uc2 A new analysis yesterday estimated that an extra 30,000 people came to Britain from Bulgaria and Romania in the first three months of 2014 compared with the same period last year, an increase of 25 per cent.\par \par \uc2 The figures by economists at the \uc2 University of Oxford\uc2 's migration observatory, which were published in The Sunday Telegraph, come before employment statistics are released on Wednesday that will provide the first assessment of new arrivals from the two EU accession countries since a temporary ban expired on January 1. They are expected to compound Mr Cameron's woes over a promise to cut net migration to the "tens of thousands" by the 2015, a figure that he was already on course to miss.\par \par \uc2 The prime minister said that he would instead focus on restricting access to benefits for those who come to Britain from other \uc2 European Union\uc2  states.\par \par \uc2 He reiterated a series of pledges on plans for reforming Britain's relationship with Brussels as he seeks to counter the threat posed to the Conservatives by Ukip. The anti-EU party is a strong contender for first place in European elections at the end of this month.\par \par \uc2 A Ukip victory would put intense pressure on Mr Cameron to take a tougher stance on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to win back supporters at the general election in May 2015.\par \par \uc2 The Conservative leader repeated a promise that he would not take on the role of prime minister for a second time unless he could guarantee that his promised in/out EU referendum would take place in 2017.\par \par \uc2 He said that "perhaps the most important" tenet of his plan for reforming Europe was an end to the concept of "ever closer union", the founding principle of the European project.\par \par \uc2 The Tory leader accepted that this would require treaty change, which fellow leaders on the continent are reluctant to agree to.\par \par \uc2 "Some of the things I'm calling for will require treaty change and that is one of them," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron will today make a joint appearance on the campaign trail with Boris Johnson, the mayor of London. It comes amid intense speculation about whether or not Mr Johnson will stand for parliament in 2015 in order to provide a launch pad for a leadership bid in the event of a Conservative defeat.\par \par \uc2 Writing in The Sunday Telegraph yesterday, Mr Cameron said that "real" patriots should vote Tory rather than be tempted to support Ukip. The Conservatives are expected to be beaten into third place behind Ukip and Labour in the European elections on May 22.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140512ea5c000ax\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Political meddling could threaten recovery, says CBI\b0\par\par\uc2 Kathryn Hopkins   \par \uc2 575 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par \uc2 The Times\par \uc2 T\par \uc2 2; National\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A cocktail of political risks could undermine the burgeoning economic recovery, Britain's biggest business lobby group has warned, as it sounded the alarm over the housing market.\par \par \uc2 The CBI, which represents tens of thousands of businesses across the country, argued that political positioning, including an unrealistic \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  target, unjustified interventions into specific markets and flirting with leaving the \uc2 European Union\uc2  must not be allowed to stifle investment.\par \par \uc2 John Cridland, the director-general of the CBI, said: "The UK now has more stable economic foundations, and political risks must not jeopardise this. Politicians must be wary of the risk of headline-grabbing policies that weaken investment, opportunity and jobs." The lobby group urged whichever political party won the next general election to stick with what was working from this parliament and not create "unnecessary uncertainty".\par \par \uc2 This included setting a market framework to encourage long-term investment and allowing the independent competition authority and economic regulators to do their job, free from political interference.\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, has already pledged to intervene in the energy markets if he comes to power next year. Last week he suggested that he could bring a number of railway lines back into public ownership.\par \par \uc2 Other key actions, according to the CBI, would include scrapping the coalition's "unhelpful" \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  target, committing to the recommendations of the Davies commission on aviation capacity and making a renewed push on housing supply to meet the urgent need for homes.\par \par \uc2 Katja Hall\uc2 , chief policy director at the CBI, said: "We're a year away from the general election and politicians must stick with what's working. That means the new government, of whatever colour, keeping the deficit reduction strategy on track. It must also tackle the UK's economic challenges and not duck the tough decisions, such as reforming public services."\par \par \uc2 The warning comes as the economic backdrop brightens, with the CBI pushing its UK growth forecast for this year and next up to 3 per cent and 2.7 per cent, from 2.6 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively.\par \par \uc2 While the recovery in 2013 was largely driven by consumer spending, the CBI said that there were encouraging signs of growth becoming broader based. It expects business investment growth of 8.3 per cent this year and 9.1 per cent next year. Unemployment is also forecast to tumble to 6.2 per cent by the end of 2015, far below the 7 per cent threshold that the Bank of England set for raising interest rates.\par \par \uc2 On the back of the improved growth outlook, the CBI now expects the Bank to lift interest rates from their record low of 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent in the first three months of next year, instead of the third quarter.\par \par \uc2 The CBI raised concerns over house price inflation, which it predicts will top 8 per cent this year. Mr Cridland warned of the risks of unsustainable house price inflation. "Housing has come back under the spotlight as annual house price inflation figures have reached double digits on some measures. While housing transactions are still running almost 30 per cent below their last peak in 2006, they are picking up steadily," he cautioned.\par \par \uc2 Last week the \uc2 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\uc2  told the government and the Bank to consider scaling back its controversial Help to Buy scheme.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140512ea5c000al\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrats have accused the education secretary of raiding his budget to divert money to free schools. This could be avoided by letting schools turn a profit\par \par \uc2 Over the course of a quarter of a century, since the 1988 Education Reform Act, under governments of all political complexions, Britain has undergone a notable revolution in the standards in its schools. The story of British education is, in fact, an unheralded success story.\par \par \uc2 A large part of the reason for the improvements that have taken place is that schools have slowly been freed up from excessive interference from local education authorities. First, the community technology colleges, then city academies and now free schools have been released from some of the curricular and regulatory requirements that held back schools in the past. Head teachers have been given the power and the outcome has been, by and large, salutary.\par \par \uc2 That is the context in which the latest spat between members of the coalition over schools policy should be viewed. Michael Gove, the education secretary, has been accused by senior Liberal Democrats of raiding a \u163\'00\'A3400 million education fund to divert the money for his programme of free schools. Mr Gove is accused of cutting a budget known as Basic Need \u8212\'20\'14 which is used to create extra school places in areas of some need \u8212\'20\'14 and using the money to cover overspending in the free schools budget of \u163\'00\'A3800 million.\par \par \uc2 This battle comes on the back of a report from the public accounts committee (PAC) last week which suggested that standards of governance and financial management in free schools were "not up to scratch". The PAC also said that the free schools programme was being rushed and that places were not opening in the areas where they were most required. This is a pungent criticism because a baby boom and increased \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  are putting great pressure on school places, especially at primary level and in particular in the major urban areas and towns in the southeast of England. The truth, though, is that seven out of every ten places in a free school are being created in areas of great need. It is also a less strong criticism of free schools to say that some are failing than is often thought. When new entrants are invited into the arena, not all of them will work out. The existence of failure is intrinsically a part of innovation and all the evidence from school reforms around the world suggests that improving practice comes from allowing new entrants. If parents choose to send their children to new schools \u8212\'20\'14 which they are doing \u8212\'20\'14 that judgment should be respected.\par \par \uc2 That is not to say, however, that the criticisms of the free school programme are invalid. The first point to make is that the education secretary does seem to spend an awful lot of time \u8212\'20\'14 if not money \u8212\'20\'14 on a project that provides the tiniest fraction of the nation's 24,000 schools. There are more problems in British education than are solved by the programme of free schools. So far, the trickle of interested parties keen on establishing new schools has been rather slow and the competitive pressure on the existing schools in poor areas is almost nonexistent.\par \par \uc2 Greater success in the free schools programme would, in fact, bring with it new problems. The education secretary is committed to providing the capital requirements of any free school. It is quite possible, in due course, that this capital requirement will be very onerous.\par \par \uc2 At that point, when money is tight, it is reasonable to ask whether the money is being spent where it is most needed. Mr Gove could step around this problem easily enough if he consented to allow schools to turn a modest, regulated profit. That would allow him to demand that such schools had to bring their own risk capital, which would lift the demand on the taxpayer to fund new school places. Whenever there is criticism of the free school policy it is assumed that the answer must be more planning and oversight. It is more likely that a better answer is that there should be less.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140512ea5c0006l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

A weekend poll put them just nine points behind the Tories. And \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  looks unable to do a single thing about it.\par \par \uc2 Our readers tell us that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is their number one priority at the moment.

But when there is no limit, in a time where many of our own kids struggle for jobs, concerns are understandable.\par \par \uc2 Until Cameron shows willingness to have Britain not Brussels control this key issue, he is going to struggle.\par \par \uc2 He needs to find something soon, though, if Farage the Weeble is to be knocked over.\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140512ea5c00096\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

That promise is \u8220\'20\'1Ccast iron\u8221\'20\'1D, he said.\par \par \uc2 Britain is seeking tougher rules to restrict welfare payments to EU migrants as part of that renegotiation process, Mr Cameron said. However, he said their freedom to work in the UK will not be changed.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister said: \u8220\'20\'1CWe need to make sure that the freedom to move to work is about that \u8211\'20\'13 it\u8217\'20\'19s to go and get a job, not to claim.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 EU free movement rights should be used mainly to allow people to move to work, Mr Cameron suggested, pointing out that British people also take advantage of the rules.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think free movement within the \uc2 European Union\uc2  is important, but it needs to be returned to the original concept, which was the freedom to be able to go and work in another country,\u8221\'20\'1D he told the BBC.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNow many British citizens go and work in other European countries. Other European citizens come to work here. Freedom to apply for a job to go and work in another country, that is one thing, but I think what we\u8217\'20\'19ve seen recently is something else.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ukip has made opposition to EU migration a central part of its campaign for the European elections this month. Polls suggest the party could win the elections, with the Conservatives in third place.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip approach would be harmful to Britain, Mr Cameron said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CUkip are saying put up the barriers, we can\u8217\'20\'19t succeed and compete in the modern world, let\u8217\'20\'19s give up on Europe." Mr Cameron said that very different levels of income between EU countries has led to \u8220\'20\'1Cmassive moves\u8221\'20\'1D of workers to Britain, including the arrival of many Polish people after 2004.\par \par \uc2 People from any future EU members should face limits on their movements until their home countries reach a certain economic standard, Mr Cameron said.\par \par \uc2 \u8221\'20\'1DYou could have transitional controls that say, for instance, that you don\u8217\'20\'19t have the freedom to move and get a job in another country until, say, your income per capita is at a certain level. That would be a way of avoiding some of the difficulties in the past.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron insisted he was so serious about his commitment to an EU referendum that he would rather cease to be prime minister at the general election next year than lead a government that does not deliver a vote.\par \par \uc2 Holding a referendum would be one of the Conservatives\u8217\'20\'19 non-negotiable demands for entering any second coalition or power-sharing deal with a smaller party after the next election, he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8221\'20\'1DI\u8217\'20\'19ve said very clearly that whatever the outcome of the next general election \u8211\'20\'13 and of course I want an overall majority and I\u8217\'20\'19m hoping and believing I can win an overall majority \u8211\'20\'13 but people should be in no doubt that I will not become Prime Minster unless I can guarantee that we can hold that referendum.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Plans for an In/Out referendum have raised the prospect of a Conservative split over Europe. But Mr Cameron insisted he leads a party that is united in support of his policy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Conservatives in Government are all committed to this plan of a renegotiation and a referendum and we are all convinced that it is possible to achieve these changes,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140511ea5b005eh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 FOUR years ago to the day, in the sun-kissed surroundings of the Downing Street rose garden, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and Nick Clegg launched their shiny new coalition government with a string of grandiose claims.\par \par \uc2 Their language was beyond effusive: 'Today we are announcing a new politics where the national interest is more important than party interest. Where co-operation wins out over confrontation. Where compromise, give and take, reasonable, civilised, grown-up behaviour is not a sign of weakness but of strength.'\par \par \uc2 How hollow those words sound today. With a year to go to the General Election, the Government has descended into a shambles of infighting and embarrassing Punch and Judy politics.\par \par \uc2 The latest spat over education began with a story leaked to the BBC that Nick Clegg's much-vaunted proposal to give free school meals to all pupils was far more costly than he was admitting and could be achieved only at the expense of cuts in front-line teaching budgets.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems responded with a retaliatory attack on Education Secretary Michael Gove's free schools programme, saying it was stealing resources from mainstream schooling. A 'senior government source', presumed to be Lib Dem schools minister David Laws, described his boss Mr Gove as 'an ideologically obsessed zealot'.\par \par \uc2 These are hardly isolated examples of acrimony at the heart of government. Iain Duncan Smith's welfare reforms, Home Secretary Theresa May's crackdown on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and knife crime, and Mr Cameron's tax breaks for married couples, are all bitterly opposed by the Lib Dems.\par \par \uc2 Indeed the Coalition is now so incapable of agreeing on any major policy area that Parliament will shut down on Thursday for a 19-day break because MPs have so little to do.\par \par \uc2 It follows their ten-day February vacation and 17 days for Easter, and precedes a six-week summer break from July 22. They return in September for eight days, then have another month off, leaving even more time for party posturing and poisonous backstage briefings.\par \par \uc2 This has been aptly described as a 'zombie government', but because of the five-year fixed term of office laid down in the Coalition agreement, we can't get rid of it for another 12 months.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile of course, MPs draw full salary and allowances while enjoying their seemingly endless holidays.\par \par \uc2 Is it any wonder the electorate is so disillusioned with Britain's increasingly remote and self-serving political class?\par \par \uc2 Con trick on care\par \par \uc2 ALTHOUGH the Government has promised a lifetime cap on care fees of \u163\'00\'A372,000, calculations by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries show better-off elderly people could end up paying double that amount before the State steps in.\par \par \uc2 Many believe the limit is already too high, but it now transpires that hidden charges could mean only a tiny minority of pensioners will receive any help at all.\par \par \uc2 With a rapidly ageing population and the public finances still in trouble, how to fund the huge costs of care is a real dilemma.\par \par \uc2 But to promise a cap, then ensure that almost no one benefits from it would be little more than a confidence trick.\par \par \uc2 Courting crime\par \par \uc2 THE revelation that nearly a third of 'prison' sentences handed down by the courts are suspended - up from just two per cent a decade ago - is a disturbing illustration of how the justice system is quietly becoming more and more lenient.\par \par \uc2 Some 11,000 criminals had more than ten previous offences on their record, yet still received suspended sentences.\par \par \uc2 With this kind of ludicrously soft justice, aren't they just being encouraged to keep on preying on the law-abiding public?\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140511ea5c00008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH Established 1855\par \par \uc2 Next week, the country will go the polls to elect its representatives to the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  for the next five years. In truth, however, it would come as a surprise if much more than one third of the electorate bothers to vote. Although a large proportion of our laws start life in Brussels, it is tempting to dismiss the importance of the parliament; indeed few of us can even identify our MEP.\par \par \uc2 Yet the parliament does matter because it can influence and instigate some policy initiatives; and the parties for the first time have the power to nominate a candidate to run the commission, though a final decision is still a matter for the \uc2 Council of Ministers\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Although disgruntled voters in many countries use the European elections as an opportunity to register a mid\u8211\'20\'13term protest against whichever domestic government is in office at the time, these contests take place against a backdrop of renewed debate about the EU's future. The Daily Telegraph will this week, both in the newspaper and online, explore many of the relevant issues, beginning today with James Kirkup's analysis of the impact of European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on the UK.\par \par \uc2 The free movement of people is a fundamental principle of the EU and, as \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  said yesterday, it enables British people to settle and work in member states just as much as the other way round. However, the rapid changes wrought in some communities by high levels of migration, especially from eastern Europe, is a concern that Ukip is exploiting in its campaign to top the poll next week.\par \par \uc2 The only guaranteed way in which the UK would be able to prevent EU citizens entering the country would be to leave, which is not the policy of any of the mainstream political parties. However, Mr Cameron, in his interview with \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  on the BBC, said he was determined to get a better deal for Britain before staging an in/out referendum on membership in 2017 should he win the general election.\par \par \uc2 Gradually, the prime minister is beginning to set out the areas for negotiation, which include making it harder for migrants to claim the dole, stop child benefit being sent to families living across the EU, a guarantee that Britain will never be forced to join the euro and an exemption from the federalist aim of "ever closer union".\par \par \uc2 But Mr Cameron needs to be clear and realistic about the chances of success \u8211\'20\'13 and also about the limits of his ambitions. The overriding reason for the cynicism that will ensure a poor turn\u8211\'20\'13out next week is that voters are fed up being promised reforms that can't be delivered or told things that turn out not to be true. One thing this debate needs above all is honesty.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140512ea5c0005r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

CITY AM.   \par \par \uc2 YES Ruth Lea The Prime Minister has outlined a list of seven changes to stop Britain being "sucked into a United States of Europe". They include demands for reforming the EU's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and trade policies, freeing business from "red tape", and an end to "ever closer union". These are laudable and quite radical aims which, if delivered, would be worthwhile. But sadly there seems little prospect they will be delivered (setting aside the issue of the outcome of the 2015 election). Any negotiated changes are likely to be minor. Bluntly, there is little appetite for any major concessions to Britain by the EU's political elite, which is all but consumed by the Eurozone - the project from which Britain resolutely stands apart. Even Germany's Angela Merkel, who is well-disposed towards Britain, has said those who expected "fundamental reform" were in "for a disappointment". Commission president \uc2 Jose Manuel Barroso\uc2  was even blunter, saying that Cameron's ambitions were "doomed to failure".\par \par \uc2 Ruth Lea\uc2  is economic adviser to the \uc2 Arbuthnot Banking Group\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 NO Christopher Howarth Nick Clegg has set himself up against Ukip's Nigel Farage as the "In" candidate come what may. But both are in total agreement that \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's renegotiation policy will fail, with Clegg saying it will only be "mild" and "minor". This is unsurprising, as both have a vested interest in renegotiation failing. For Clegg, powers flowing back to the national level is anathema. And for Farage, reform gets in the way of his rush for the exit. Confusing the issue is the fact Cameron has not said what he wants to reform. He has outlined some areas, including powers flowing back to member states, less regulation, more free trade, and reform of benefits for EU migrants. But success in these areas will be difficult to discern. That leaves Cameron with a dilemma. Ask for too much, and Clegg will either object or say he has failed if he does not achieve it. Ask for too little, and he will not be able to persuade the British people things have changed before his 2017 referendum. \uc2 Christopher Howarth\uc2  is senior policy analyst at Open Europe.\par \par \uc2 Document CITYMO0020140512ea5c0000z\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 British industry most confident in two decades\b0\par\par\uc2 MICHAEL BIRD   \par \uc2 208 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par \uc2 City AM\par \uc2 CITYMO\par \uc2 1; National\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014.

The poll's index for manufacturing has climbed even further to 120.8, far above 100, the level which indicates the sector's long-term average.\par \par \uc2 Before now, the UK's industrial base has not recovered as quickly as its services firms since the start of the crisis, and output in total still remains some way below what it was before the start of the financial crisis and subsequent recession.\par \par \uc2 BDO's \uc2 Peter Hemington\uc2  said that a turn towards protectionism by politicians could be harmful to the sector's current recovery: "Policymakers' restrictions on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  have not helped the UK labour market. It would be disappointing if there was an equivalent move in industrial policy to protect companies in so-called strategic sectors."\par \par \uc2 Hemington added: "Open trade creates higher wealth and income and the UK's tradition in this respect is a fine one."\par \par \uc2 Document CITYMO0020140512ea5c0000g\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s no to cap on EU migrants: PM says free movement is \u8216\'20\'18important\u8217\'20\'19 right as figures show growing number of Romanians and Bulgarians have come to the UK\b0\par\par\uc2 JACK DOYLE, HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT and JASON GROVES, DEPUTY POLITICAL EDITOR   \par \uc2 763 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par 01:03\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

He said that he will refuse to form a Coalition or lead a minority government unless he can ensure the referendum will go ahead.\par \par \uc2 And he indicated that he could urge Britain to leave the EU if his attempt to claw back powers fails.\par \par \uc2 He told the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s Andrew Marr Show he would not \u8216\'20\'18sit on the fence\u8217\'20\'19, adding: \u8216\'20\'18We have the referendum whether or not I have successfully negotiated. I think the negotiation will be successful.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron said that he wanted curb EU migrants\u8217\'20\'19 access to benefits, with a longer waiting period before people to claim and an end to making child benefit payments to children living abroad.\par \par \uc2 He also said he wanted Britain to be excluded from the EU\u8217\'20\'19s historic drive towards \u8216\'20\'18ever-closer union\u8217\'20\'19 - a move that will require a change to the EU\u8217\'20\'19s founding Treaty of Rome.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister also repeated his view that future countries joining the EU, such as Turkey, should have to wait far longer before their citizens could come to the UK to work.\par \par \uc2 Government sources have floated the idea in the past that ministers could try to impose an annual cap on EU \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - a move that would lead to a furious stand-off with Brussels.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Cameron yesterday indicated that he had no plans to limit EU migrant labour - the issue credited with driving support for Ukip.\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8216\'20\'18I think free movement within the \uc2 European Union\uc2  is important, but it needs to be returned to the original concept, which was the freedom to be able to go and work in another country. Now many British citizens go and work in other European countries. Other European citizens come to work here.'\par \par \uc2 His comments on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  will disappoint those Tory MPs calling for an end to free movement and the repatriation of border powers from Brussels.\par \par \uc2 This week official \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  statistics are expected to confirm a spike in numbers since border controls were abolished in January.\par \par \uc2 Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva from the Migration Obseratory said he expected to see a \u8216\'20\'18big increase\u8217\'20\'19 in numbers.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It is almost certain that we are going to see an increase in that number from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter in 2014.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18We would expect at least 30,000 more. It is difficult to predict, but that would be the minimum you would expect.'\par \par \uc2 It appears impossible for ministers to hit their pledge to cut net migration to the \u8216\'20\'18tens of thousands\u8217\'20\'19 by the end of the Parliament.\par \par \uc2 The figure fell to around 150,000 in 2012 but leapt again last year to 212,000 driven by the arrival of workers from southern European states in economic turmoil.\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140511ea5c009fe\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 World\par \b \uc2 British legal hypocrisy, so obvious in Northern Ireland, has spread to Syria - and of course the rest of the Middle East\b0\par\par\uc2 Robert Fisk   \par \uc2 1,185 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par \uc2 The Independent\par \uc2 IND\par \uc2 1ST\par 24,25\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 World\par \par \uc2 The law is the law is the law. So I was taught as a child. But it's all baloney. Take the case of Gerry Adams, "arrested" and then released after chatting to the Northern Ireland police - I notice the cops did not use the old clich\u233\'00\'E9 about "helping the police with their inquiries" - about the torture and murder and "disappearance" of Jean McConville. It is, to quote Fintan O'Toole, that wise old bird of Irish philosophy, "an atrocity that cries out for accountability" - in which Adams has consistently denied any involvement. Sinn Fein announced that Adams's "arrest" was political, a remark that got the usual tsk-tsk from Unionists and British alike.\par \par \uc2 But alas, Theresa Villiers, the latest in the hordes of Northern Ireland secretaries to be visited upon Belfast, also announced, a wee bit before Adams's "arrest", that there would be no independent inquiry into the killing of 11 unarmed civilians in Ballymurphy in August 1971 by soldiers of the Parachute Regiment, the most undisciplined British military unit to be sent to the province, which later killed another 14 civilians in Derry on Bloody Sunday. In the Ballymurphy shooting, the Brits managed to kill a Catholic priest carrying an improvised white flag, and a mother of eight children who went to help a wounded boy. The deaths of Father Hugh Mullan and Joan Connolly were also deaths that "cry out for accountability". But of course, there will be none. Ms Villiers has seen to that.\par \par \uc2 She also ensured that there would be no inquiry into the fire-bombing of the La Mon hotel in 1978, when the IRA burned 12 people to death. Families of the dead have their suspicions that transcripts of police interviews with IRA suspects to this crime were removed from the archives to protect important people involved in the "peace process" in Northern Ireland. No complaints about that, needless to say, from the IRA. But you can see the problem: if arresting Adams just before the European elections was not political, then surely the British refusal to inquire into the slaughter in Ballymurphy - assuming the soldiers involved have not died of old age - was political. After all, the Brits know who these soldiers were, their names, their ages and ranks. They have much more than the statements of two dead IRA supporters - the "evidence" against Adams - to go on.\par \par \uc2 Now you may argue that the Saville inquiry into Bloody Sunday cost far too many millions of pounds to warrant another investigation into the Ballymurphy deaths. But then you may also ask why the soldiers who gave evidence to the original inquiry were given the cover of anonymity. This was something Gerry Adams was not offered - nor, given the favourable political fallout, was he likely to have asked for it. But then it would also be pleasant if the Brits who know something about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings during the worst days of the Irish war could pop over to Dublin and give a little evidence about this particular atrocity. No chance of that, of course.\par \par \uc2 And you don't have to stick in Ireland for further proof of legal hypocrisy. Take our beloved Home Secretary's decision to deprive British \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  of their British passports if they go to fight Assad's regime in Syria. Quite apart from the fact that William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, and his friends originally supported the armed Syrian opposition, there are problems with the passport story. Many British supporters of Israel, for example, have fought on Israel's behalf in Israeli uniform in that country's wars. But what if they served in Israeli units known to have committed war crimes in Lebanon or Gaza? Or in the Israeli air force, which promiscuously kills civilians in war. Are they, too, to be deprived of their passports if they were not born in the UK? Of course not. One law for Muslims, another for non-Muslims - not unlike Spain's offer of passports to the descendants of those driven from their homes in the 15th century, a generous act somewhat damaged by the fact that only Jews (not Muslims) may take advantage of it.\par \par \uc2 We will not dwell upon all the other hypocrisies of the Middle East - the outrage at any Iranian interest in acquiring nuclear weapons, for example, when another country in the region has an awful lot of nuclear weapons; or US fury at Russian annexation of Crimea but no anger at all about the annexation of Golan or the theft of Arab land in the West Bank, which are equally illegal under international law. Upon such foundations is aggression built: the illegal invasion of Iraq, for instance.\par \par \uc2 I contemplate all this because of a little research I'm undertaking about a Moroccan air force colonel who, in 1972, tried to stage a coup against the brutal King Hassan who was also, by the way, quite an expert on "disappearances". Mohamed Amekrane flew to Gibraltar and threw himself upon the dodgy mercy of Her Majesty. He pleaded for asylum (after all, the coup had failed) but we packed him off back to Morocco because, while the European Convention on Human Rights gives anyone the right to leave his or her own country, no international treaty obliges a country to give that person asylum. So back Amekrane went - and was, of course, put to death. His widow eventually got \u163\'00\'A337,500 from the \uc2 British government\uc2  - ex gratia, needless to say, out of goodwill not guilt, you understand - and Colonel Amekrane was then erased from history. Interesting to see what happens to the ex-Brits who lose their passports for going to Syria - and have to go back to the country of their birth. They might be better off - and live longer lives - if they to go off to fight in another jihad.\par \par \uc2 The Great War's forgotten victims in the Levant\par \par \uc2 Horrors of the Great War you will not read about this year: among the casualties were another million dead, the men, women and children of the Ottoman Levant - for which read modern-day Lebanon and Syria - who died of famine, victims of both the Allied blockade of the east Mediterranean coastline (which is why we ignore these particular souls) and of the Turkish army's seizure of all food and farm animals from the civilian population; all this in addition to the million and a half slaughtered Armenians of 1915. Many Lebanese remember parents who ate nettles to stay alive, just as the Irish did in the famine. I have a book by Father Antoine Yammine, published in Cairo in 1922, illustrated with photos of stick-like children and of a priest in his habit lying dead on a Beirut street, another of a baby suckling at his dead mother's breast outside their front door. "And some there be which have no memorial; who are perished as though they had never been\u8230\'20\'26"\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140512ea5c00019\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 WORLD NEWS\par \b \uc2 Survey shows gloomy mood of EU voters; Pessimism expected to boost eurosceptics\b0\par\par\uc2 By Gordon Smith in London   \par \uc2 686 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFTA\par \uc2 USA Ed1\par 02\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

More than a third of those questioned felt the economy was worse than a year ago and 43 per cent said it was no better.\par \par \uc2 The gloomy responses show the challenges confronting mainstream politicians across Europe as they seek to persuade disenchanted voters about a nascent recovery in the economy that many still do not discern.\par \par \uc2 That sense of frustration and insecurity is expected to propel a band of eurosceptic and populist parties to new heights in the European parliament when -voters go to the polls from May 22-25.\par \par \uc2 Respondents in France, the EU's second-largest economy, stood out as the most negative, according to Harris, which questioned more than 5,000 people in the UK, Spain, Italy, Germany and France.\par \par \uc2 Thirty-nine per cent of respondents in France said the economy was "much worse" than it was a year ago, while 22 per cent said it was "slightly worse". In Italy, too, a majority of voters felt the economy was weaker than it was a year ago. Asked if they felt more secure in their jobs, 58 per cent of Italians answered: "No, not at all."\par \par \uc2 By contrast, more than a third of voters in Britain felt the economy was in better shape than it was a year ago, providing another example of growing consumer confidence. The UK recently had its 2014 growth forecast upgraded by the \uc2 OECD\uc2  club of mostly rich nations to 3.2 per cent, giving it the strongest economic outlook of any G7 country.\par \par \uc2 France, by contrast, was downgraded by the \uc2 OECD\uc2 , emphasising the sluggish rate of recovery that has compounded the deep unpopularity of president \uc2 Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Hollande\uc2  . Mr Hollande conceded last week that he would not run for re-election if the persistently high unemployment rate was not falling by the time of the next presidential election, in 2017.\par \par \uc2 "French people have no confidence in politics and are worried about unemployment and they think they will not have enough money for tomorrow," said Jean-Daniel Levy, head of opinion and political research at \uc2 Harris Interactive\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The survey also shows that French voters are the most disillusioned with the European parliament, with only 10 per cent viewing the institution as more relevant than it was at the last EU elections, in 2009 - even though its powers have increased dramatically since then.\par \par \uc2 In Britain, where the City was stung by a cap on banker bonuses, which MEPs had pushed for, respondents were twice as likely as their French counterparts to judge that the parliament had become more relevant.\par \par \uc2 But British voters were clearly the most eurosceptic when asked which party they were likely to vote for.\par \par \uc2 Thirty-six per cent of Britons said they were "most inclined" to vote for a party that campaigned for their country's withdrawal from the EU. That compares with just 15 and 16 per cent in Germany and Spain, respectively. In France, where the rightwing National Front is leading neck and neck with the centre-right UMP, 22 per cent of voters said they would support a party that sought an exit from the EU.\par \par \uc2 The survey also underlined the importance of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as an issue in the European elections.\par \par \uc2 More than half of all voters asked - rising to 77 per cent in the UK - agreed with the statement their country had "too many \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from the EU".\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140512ea5c0001n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Lobby group says 'headline-grabbing' as elections near is bad for investment, write \uc2 Brian Groom\uc2  and Emily Cadman\par \par \uc2 Corporate Britain faces a "cocktail" of political risks that present a serious threat to the economic recovery , the head of the biggest business lobby group has warned.\par \par \uc2 John Cridland , director-general of the CBI , urged politicians to refrain from "headline-grabbing policies that weaken investment, opportunities and jobs".\par \par \uc2 He said business faced an unusually intense combination of political risks because of next spring's general election, this autumn's Scottish independence referendum and a possible referendum on EU membership.\par \par \uc2 The CBI raised its growth forecast to 3 per cent this year and 2.7 per cent next, up from its previous prediction of 2.6 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively, but said that "political uncertainty remains a major risk to the recovery".\par \par \uc2 Although the organisation insisted it would remain non-partisan, many business chiefs are alarmed by salvos by Ed Miliband , the Labour leader, against banks, energy companies, betting companies, pension providers, housebuilders and transport companies.\par \par \uc2 They fear that if Labour were elected and Mr Miliband translated his rhetoric into action, it could create a climate more hostile to big business than at any time since the 1970s.\par \par \uc2 However, the CBI said its concerns applied to all the main parties. It called for the coalition's "unhelpful" net migration target to be scrapped and urged the parties to commit themselves in advance to implementing the recommendations of the Davies Commission on airport capacity .\par \par \uc2 It also cited "flirting with leaving the \uc2 European Union\uc2 " as a risk. \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , the prime minister, proposes to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU and hold a referendum by 2017 if the Conservatives win the election.\par \par \uc2 The CBI also urged the next government to "stick with what's working" and keep the deficit reduction strategy on track.\par \par \uc2 "Political positioning must not be allowed to stifle investment, whether it's an unrealistic \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  target, unjustified interventions into specific markets, flirting with leaving the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , delaying vital long-term infrastructure projects or restricting labour market flexibility," said \uc2 Katja Hall\uc2 , chief policy director.\par \par \uc2 She cited Mr Miliband's promises to freeze energy prices and break up big banks as concerns. Other business leaders are worried about Labour's plan to raise the top income tax rate to 50p, but Labour says it is seeking to protect consumers and champion small businesses.\par \par \uc2 "If Miliband carries through with the interventions he has promised, it would certainly damage the economy's competitiveness," said the head of a large professional services business.\par \par \uc2 The business leader added: "We have to hope he would be more pragmatic in office, and realise that investment can move very quickly these days."\par \par \uc2 A FTSE 100 chairman said the speed of reaction of global markets had changed since the 1970s. "The markets wouldn't let Miliband get very far if they didn't like what he was doing. In France, President [Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois] Hollande has had to change course more rapidly than [Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois] Mitterrand did."\par \par \uc2 The CBI urged the next government to be prepared to raise the "tier two" visa cap for skilled migrants as the economy recovers. It called for current industrial strategy to continue and urged swifter opening-up of public services to private sector bids. The CBI gave strong backing to the government's flagship Help to Buy scheme , which has faced criticism over concerns it is contributing to rapidly rising house prices.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cridland said it was important to remember the scheme had been introduced because the market "was completely stuck" and pointed to evidence it had mostly been used outside London and mainly for first-time buyers. "Its original purpose is being achieved," he said, adding Britain had "ducked for too long" the fundamental requirement to build more houses.\par \par \uc2 Latest figures from Acadata, whose numbers include cash sales, unlike other indices, suggest house prices rose 7.3 per cent in the year to April. Mr Cridland said the housing market was high on the CBI's risk register but he was confident that regulators were ready to act.\par \par \uc2 The CBI joined the market consensus in bringing forward its expectation of interest rate rises to the first quarter of next year, on the back of a sharp upgrade in its growth forecasts to 3 per cent for this year. In particular, it forecasts businesses becoming more willing to invest.\par \par \uc2 The business organisation said there were encouraging signs growth was becoming more broad-based, but it played down hopes that exports would play a big role in the recovery. It said exports were likely to strengthen as the global economy picked up but that this was likely to be neutralised by increasing consumer demand for imports.\par \par \uc2 Despite concerns about a hit to the export sector from the growing strength of sterling, which hit a new five-year high against the dollar last week, Mr Cridland stressed that the pound was still substantially weaker than its pre-crisis peak and unlikely to be a large inhibiting factor.\par \par \uc2 Areas of concern Policies vexing the employers' group\par \par \uc2 - Energy price freeze\par \par \uc2 - Airport capacity\par \par \uc2 - Break-up of big banks\par \par \uc2 - \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  targets\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020140512ea5c0000x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw160\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2400\pichgoal600

He says that the biggest threat to businesses is a lack of awareness.\par \par \uc2 "SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), in particular, have no idea of the cost of a security breach. .. it''s not just financial, it''s not just the theft of money or of credit card details, but the theft of information and the damage to reputation," he said.\par \par \uc2 "If you have five or 10 people in a company, if most of the sales come from online \u8212\'20\'14 if a website goes down for two or three days, lost sales and damage to reputation can be hugely expensive.\par \par \uc2 "The cost of one hacking attack would be enough to put many small firms out of business. It''s been estimated that just three to five days of a website being down could cost between \u163\'00\'A330,000 and \u163\'00\'A350,000.\par \par \uc2 "Initiatives like the Innovation Voucher and the 10 Steps to Cyber Security plan are a step in the right direction but there needs to be more awareness. Hackers are gaining access to customer lists and credit card information. In lots of cases companies are hacked and they don''t know it. A customer''s credit card details will be used and tested in small transactions and eventually the rate and size of the transaction may increase.\par \par \uc2 "I think with the the surge in online and mobile payments, which is set to really increase over the next two years, and with the increase of things like online and mobile checkins at airports, more avenues for cybercrime will be opening up and this raises a lot of questions.\par \par \uc2 "Will identity have to become further embedded in phones, will physical attributes become part of security? Clever electronics companies like Apple and Samsung are already looking at fingerprint and retinal ID technology."\par \par \uc2 Northern Ireland is already home to some major companies which specialise in security and biometrics.\par \par \uc2 One such firm is Core Systems, which makes software which drives security systems in a growing number of jails in the UK, the US, and other parts of the world. From its Crumlin Road base, it develops security and biometric software which can identify people from their personal characteristics, such as fingerprints or eyes.\par \par \uc2 That lends itself to the the custody sector, including prisons, police stations and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  centres, and it has found an eager market for its high-tech products.\par \par \uc2 Core Systems is investing \u163\'00\'A3700,000 in an expansion and research and development project to secure new opportunities in the US market. The firm frequently appears in the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 Awards, a list of the top 50 fastest-growing technology companies in Ireland and recently won an award at the \uc2 Invest NI\uc2 /\uc2 British Airways\uc2  Export Challenge Competition.\par \par \uc2 A far younger company, which has spun out of the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) at Queen''s University Belfast, is Liopa, the world''s first lip authentication processor for mobile devices, which could eventually replace the traditional security password. Initial product development has been funded through the Technology Strategy Board and the company is now working with a local point-of-sales firm Countering the attack \u201\'00\'C9 In March, The Economist Intelligence Unit launched CyberTab, a free and anonymous calculator that helps companies tally the cost of specific cyber attacks. \u201\'00\'C9 CyberTab users can input a range of expenses and estimated costs for either a specific attack scenario or actual breach. The tool will then generate a report details the cost and enables a cost-benefit analysis of security strategies. \u201\'00\'C9The Cyber Security UK Challenge is bringing together experts to design and develop a series of challenges and competitions that will test the nation's cybersecurity skills. This group is led by a management team consisting of professional bodies, government departments, private industry, and public sector organisations. \u201\'00\'C9The Technology Strategy Board in the UK has launched Innovation Vouchers for SMEs, entrepreneurs and early-stage start-ups who see value in protecting and growing their online business by having effective cyber security. The TSB makes \u163\'00\'A35,000 available to each successful applicant to fund initiatives such as a ''cyber audit'' for existing processes and for start-up companies needing to build cyber security into the business.\par \par \uc2 \u201\'00\'C9The Cyber Security Guidance for Business, produced by CESG (the information security arm of GCHQ), the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, aims to help the private sector minimise the risks to company assets. The guidance includes a ''Ten Steps to Cyber Security'' programme for companies.\par \par \uc2 to trial the software with a view to including it in their verification process.\par \par \uc2 David Crozier, from the firm, was involved in organising the fourth annual cyber security conference hosted by the CSIT, at Queen''s University recently.\par \par \uc2 Speakers from 12 different countries on four continents \u8212\'20\'14 representing \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , Intel, \uc2 IBM\uc2 , GCHQ, the Korea Information and Security Agency, Estonian Information System''s Authority and McAfee \u8212\'20\'14 all addressed the event.\par \par \uc2 The conference heard that Queen''s University is to offer a new masters degree in cyber security, which will be launched this September.\par \par \uc2 "Having our first reference company for Liopa is a big step and we are looking to build the company out, seek investment and ramp up recruitment and sales from an initial team of four," said Mr Crozier.\par \par \uc2 "The selling point for lip biometrics is that companies don''t need to invest in biometric hardware like fingerprint scanners or sensing equipment \u8212\'20\'14 we are taking advantage of sensors and cameras already installed on phones, there is very little additional hardware needed," he explained He added that Northern Ireland is well placed to fill the global cybersecurity gap.\par \par \uc2 He said: "If you look at the Belfast market in terms of skills, the raw material is. .. really well placed, in. .. our computer science and electronic engineering graduates, and the roll out of the MSc will just enhance that.\par \par \uc2 "We try not to play up concerns but we are seeing more industrial espionage \u8212\'20\'14 attacks on intellectual property and trade secrets and the details of major infrastructure projects or sensitive security matters.\par \par \uc2 "Small companies making tiny parts, which are part of a bigger international supply chain, need to look very carefully at their security as they could be seen as a weak link where criminals can gain an access point.\par \par \uc2 "Network intrusion to seek customer databases and records, can sometimes not only be used to cause financial damage but to set up mirror companies and websites which can then be used for more advanced organised crime."\par \par \uc2 The cost of one hacking attack would put most small firms out of business\par \par \uc2 Document WBEL000020140511ea5c0001j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Most over-70s in Britain still feel uncomfortable about homosexuality, the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, has said.\par \par \uc2 The politician made the claim as he defended Roger Helmer, the Ukip byelection candidate in Newark, who said in a pamphlet from 2000 that homosexuality is "abnormal" and "undesirable". Helmer also questioned the concept of homophobia, and compared allowing equal marriage to legalising incest.\par \par \uc2 Defending his candidate, Farage argued that many older people were not happy with the idea of homosexuality, let alone the idea of gay people marrying.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader has repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether he supports gay marriage, retracting a statement from his party saying it would not repeal same-sex marriage legislation.\par \par \uc2 He told BBC1's Sunday Politics: "Roger Helmer is fighting this byelection for us; he's somebody of 70 years of age who grew up with a strong Christian Bible background. He grew up in an age when homosexuality was actually imprisonable, and he had a certain set of views which he maintained for many years which he now says he accepts the world's moved on and he's relaxed about."\par \par \uc2 Farage pointed out that the comments were made when Helmer was a Conservative MEP and not a member of Ukip. "I've never seen a single comment from Roger Helmer on race that would be deemed to be offensive, ever. Really," Farage said.\par \par \uc2 Helmer has said he now accepts gay marriage and told the Guardian last week he had modified his views after "catching the zeitgeist".\par \par \uc2 Farage's comments come a few days after Harry Perry, a Ukip council candidate in Stockport, was suspended for branding David Cameron a "gay-loving nutcase".\par \par \uc2 Farage also gave his support to Victoria Ayling, who has been selected as a Ukip parliamentary candidate despite having been recorded on tape saying of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 : "I just want to send the lot back."\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader claimed the Lincolnshire county councillor had been misquoted and she had only been referring to migrant workers who were in the country illegally. "I've seen the tape and it's a complete misquote, and she says it in the context of illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , and she says: 'That's what I'd like to say, but now I can't say it."\par \par \uc2 Deflecting the questions about his candidates, Farage said: "We can talk about this, or what we could talk about is the fact that in 12 days' time, we have a national election - a European election . . . and it's really interesting."\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, David Cameron has given a guarantee that he would deliver a \uc2 European Union\uc2  referendum by the end of 2017 as he urged voters not to succumb to Ukip's belief that "we're all doomed".\par \par \uc2 On BBC's \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show he said he was confident of being able to negotiate reforms of the EU, but if not, he would not "sit on the fence" in the subsequent referendum, suggesting he has not ruled out campaigning for Britain to leave.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140511ea5c0002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Comment and Debate Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: Who really wants to roll back the state? Not the right: This government props up big business and delves into our private lives. The left should reclaim individualism\b0\par\par\uc2 Owen Jones   \par \uc2 1,110 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Behold, the onward march of the state. Describing the current occupants of No 10 as statists might sound provocatively counterintuitive. Ever since the neoliberals began reshaping Britain in their own image, from the 1970s onwards, state-bashing has become a kind of national religion. Critics of austerity - such as myself - have slammed today's Tories for rolling back the state in ways Margaret Thatcher would have dismissed as too radical. The Lib Dems are fellow travellers: when Nick Clegg became their leader, he promised to "define a liberal alternative to the discredited politics of big government". Projections by the \uc2 Office for Budget Responsibility\uc2  suggest day-to-day spending on public services will drop to levels unseen in Britain for decades.\par \par \uc2 And yet, in so many ways, this government has promoted the growth of the state through its policies. Take what the government and its allies call "welfare dependency". Last week it was revealed that, since the Clegg-Cameron love-in began, wages have tanked and the number of people in work claiming housing benefit has jumped by 59%. There were 650,561 workers claiming housing benefit when the coalition was formed. That soared to more than 1 million last year, costing the taxpayer an extra pounds 4.8bn. Overall, 4.3 million are now thought to claim in-work benefits. The state has grown because we are subsidising employers who are paying wages workers cannot live on and private landlords charging rents tenants cannot afford.\par \par \uc2 Statism intrudes into people's lives in more pernicious ways under the coalition. The long-term unemployed will be compelled to march to a jobcentre every day: more a means for the state to humiliate those without work and treat them as feckless leeches than a serious attempt to find them employment. The state has come up with other sticks to discipline those thrown out of work: benefit "sanctions" strip unemployed people - including poppy-selling war veterans such as Stephen Taylor - of support, for the most spurious reasons.\par \par \uc2 The Lobbying Act - in reality, a gagging law - imposes onerous new regulations on nongovernmental organisations. Michael Gove is centralising education, leaving free schools and academies in the clutches of the secretary of state rather than accountable to local authorities. The idea of a crackdown on tax avoidance is hugely popular, but George Osborne proposes giving HMRC the power to seize money from people's accounts - a statist measure that lacks due process. Rather than going after giant corporations such as Amazon and \uc2 Google\uc2 , who find devious means to avoid paying what they owe, the state is after the little people.\par \par \uc2 Then there's the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  bill, which compels landlords to check the status of their tenants, transforming them into agents of the state. The government repeatedly tries to resurrect attempts to give itself powers to monitor emails. The first wave of student protests against the coalition was met with police batons and kettles, a form of state repression condemned by the UN as "detrimental to the exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly". And what else is Help to Buy than a reckless state subsidy for mortgages, fuelling yet another a housing bubble?\par \par \uc2 Thatcherism promised to set the individual free, but authoritarian statism was always part of its creed. It imposed laws boastfully described by Tony Blair as "the most restrictive on trade unions in the western world"; David Cameron now proposes to make them more restrictive still. The police were given sweeping powers to batter down the miners 30 years ago; then came legislation giving them the right to stop and search citizens without reasonable suspicion, and anti-terror laws that eroded individual rights in favour of the state. We've even had undercover police officers having sexual relationships with radical activists: statism has invaded the bedroom under false pretences.\par \par \uc2 It falls to the left, then, to roll back the state. The state dependency of poverty-pay employers and rip-off landlords could be reduced with a living wage and by allowing local authorities to build homes. State powers that intrude on the civil rights of trade unionists, protesters and ethnic minorities could be repealed. A new federal Britain could take power away from the central state in favour of regions and local authorities. Public ownership is often caricatured as being about as statist as it gets, in large part because of the postwar model pioneered by Peter Mandelson's grandfather, Herbert Morrison, who introduced the Attlee government's top-down, bureaucratic form of nationalisation. Instead, the left could propose a form of democratic social ownership for rail, energy, water and other utilities that hands management to workers and consumers.\par \par \uc2 There is a long tradition of individualism on the left waiting to be reclaimed. At the beginning of the 20th century, the French socialist leader Jean Jaures wrote about how capitalism alienated workers from their "very individuality". Indeed, the individual needs to be defended from more than the state. Poverty strips individuals of their freedom, imposing limitations on every aspect of their lives, from what they can eat to how they spend their leisure time. To provide for themselves and their families, workers are compelled to work some of the longest hours in Europe, losing time that could be spent on more fulfilling activities. Hence the need to limit the working day and crack down on unpaid overtime. Freed from financial hardship, excessive work and the constant fear of job and housing insecurity, the individual can prosper and fulfil her or his potential.\par \par \uc2 For the right, rolling back the state means allowing the wealthy to behave as they wish, while coming down hard on the poor. They hand public assets to profiteers at knockdown prices, robbing the taxpayer and leaving individuals at the mercy of private companies who have no interest in their wellbeing. Taxpayers spend far more on subsidies for privately owned railways than they did in the era of \uc2 British Rail\uc2 : "rolling back the state" in this case means "socialism for the rich". "Individualism" for the right means leaving the rich to prosper at the expense of society while those at the bottom must sink or swim.\par \par \uc2 The authoritarian statists in No 10 have got away with dressing themselves up as freedom-loving champions of the individual for too long. The fight for personal freedom and liberty is a great historic cause, but it now falls to the left to take it up.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @owenjones84\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140511ea5c0000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 : in-out referendum on EU by 2017 is cast-iron pledge\b0\par\par\uc2 Rowena Mason   \par \uc2 theguardian.com\par \uc2 805 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2014\par \uc2 Guardian.co.uk\par \uc2 GRULTD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Guardian News & Media Limited. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 PM turns on Ukip 'doom-mongers' and suggests he would not be prepared to lead minority government after 2015 election\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  has said he would deliver a referendum on Europe if he remains prime minister after 2015, as he urged floating voters not to succumb to Ukip's belief that "we're all doomed".\par \par \uc2 "I will not become prime minster unless I can guarantee that we can hold that referendum," Cameron told the BBC's \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show on Sunday. His comments suggest he would not be prepared to lead a minority government after the 2015 election, as he would not be able to secure a referendum on Britain's EU membership from that position.\par \par \uc2 The prime minister's pledge echoed his "cast-iron guarantee" when in opposition that he would hold a poll on the Lisbon treaty \u8211\'20\'13 which never happened because \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  had already ratified it by the time Cameron came to power.\par \par \uc2 Ukip held up Cameron's failure to meet his promise as a sign that the Conservative leader could not be trusted to hold a referendum on EU membership.\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage, Ukip's leader, said voters would struggle to believe Cameron's promise was "worth a row of beans".\par \par \uc2 Farage told BBC One's Sunday Politics: "He has difficulty being believed because five years ago I sat here talking to you about the European elections and you put to me: 'Well, it's going to be very difficult, Nigel, for people to vote Ukip because Mr Cameron has given a cast-iron guarantee that if he becomes prime minister next year he'll have a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.'"\par \par \uc2 "He didn't deliver on that and he knows that people struggle to believe firstly, that he will get a majority and secondly, that the renegotiation is actually worth a row of beans."\par \par \uc2 Cameron used his BBC interview to say he was confident of being able to negotiate reforms of the EU and then hold a poll by the end of 2017. If he could not secure concessions from Brussels, Cameron said he would not "sit on the fence" in the subsequent referendum, suggesting he had not ruled out campaigning for the UK to leave.\par \par \uc2 Asked if holding a referendum was a cast-iron pledge, he said: "Absolutely. We will hold that referendum by the end of 2017; it will be a referendum on an in-out basis \u8211\'20\'13 do we stay in a reformed \uc2 European Union\uc2  or do we leave? And I've said very clearly that whatever the outcome of the next general election \u8211\'20\'13 and of course I want an overall majority and I'm hoping and believing I can win an overall majority \u8211\'20\'13 but people should be in no doubt that I will not become prime minister unless I can guarantee that we can hold that referendum."\par \par \uc2 In advance of this month's European and local council elections, Cameron fleshed out some of his aims for EU reform, including tougher restrictions on migrants claiming benefits and exempting Britain from an obligation to be part of "ever closer union", which is written into the treaty of Rome.\par \par \uc2 But he also signalled he did not want to scrap rules giving EU citizens the right to live and work in Britain. Instead, he suggested new restrictions could be applied when poorer countries join, so that their citizens could only move to the UK when their per capita income was high enough.\par \par \uc2 "Free movement within the \uc2 European Union\uc2  is important but it needs to be returned to the original concept, which was the freedom to be able to go and work in another country," he said.\par \par \uc2 His support for the principle of free movement is likely to be seized on by Ukip as evidence Cameron will not try to rip up EU rules to curb \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from existing member states. Some Conservatives are worried about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  figures due to be published on the day of the European elections that are expected to show higher \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  into the UK from Romania and Bulgaria.\par \par \uc2 In an appeal to his core vote, Cameron addressed an article in the Sunday Telegraph at those whose pencils were "hovering over the Conservative box" on their postal vote ballot papers for the 22 May elections, which are due to arrive on doormats over the next few days.\par \par \uc2 He also criticised those politicians who "refuse to be upbeat about Britain" in a thinly veiled attack on Ukip. "To them, pessimism equals patriotism," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 "They insist that our best days are behind us and that everything is bound to get worse. Like Private Frazer politicians they're perennially crying out that 'we're all doomed'."\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140511ea5c0005q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer Review Agenda\par \b \uc2 The New Review: Agenda: PEOPLE: Q&A: \uc2 Antonio Pappano\uc2 : The \uc2 Royal Opera\uc2 's music director on elitism, overwork, Beyonce - and why conductors are like football managers\b0\par\par\uc2 Fiona Maddocks   \par \uc2 1,386 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Antonio Pappano\uc2 , 54, is bringing his Orchestra and Chorus of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, Rome to London and Birmingham for three concerts this month.\par \par \uc2 Nowadays you get described as an "opera conductor and TV personality". Does it get any better for a classical musician?\par \par \uc2 I've never thought of myself as a TV personality! I'm not complaining. If it brings classical music out in the open and stops it being something to be fearful of, I'm happy. TV is about performance too - in my case it's about the communication of passion, emotion, belief.\par \par \uc2 We're used to you being in the opera pit as music director of the Royal Opera. Now you're doing a concert - one with a theme, the music of freedom.\par \par \uc2 I've chosen music from Beethoven's Fidelio and the Ode to Joy in his Ninth Symphony, as well as Dallapiccola's Il prigioniero, linked by the idea of political imprisonment and freedom. I'm particularly interested in programmes in some way connected with war. Most people of my generation haven't gone to war. We've been lucky. We're also doing Verdi's Requiem which, like Italian religion itself, is highly theatrical. It wails, cries, storms, explodes. . .\par \par \uc2 Who or what is the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia? Can we shorten the name?\par \par \uc2 No we can't shorten it! It's born out of a school in Rome named after the patron saint of music - dating back to 1585 and Pope Sixtus V. For the past seven years I've been music director and we've developed a wonderful chemistry - technically, musically. For me, given I spend so much time in the opera pit, getting so involved with the multifaceted aspects of opera, it's a far more intimate collaboration between musician, music, composer.\par \par \uc2 You could pass for an Italian (parentage) or American (upbringing) or a Londoner (birth and early childhood). Who is the real \uc2 Antonio Pappano\uc2  and where is he most at home?\par \par \uc2 I'm very flexible. I've had to be. All my life I've had to adapt - my parents were \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to London and then all of us, when I was a child, moved to the States and so we were \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  twice over. I try to use everything I've seen, everywhere I've been, in my work: the American \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  work ethic, the Italian theatricality, the British grit and professionalism. But I'm very much at home in London. I'm involved with a theatre I adore and the people in it. The Royal Opera House is a wonderful platform.\par \par \uc2 You've made a film with the Santa Cecilia orchestra called The Italian Character? Can you sum up the reality versus the cliche?\par \par \uc2 An orchestra is about teamwork. The cliche is that getting all these highly individual Italians to work as a team is the hardest thing in the world. That cliche is a bit worn out now, as any conductor who works with the orchestra will tell you: the opposite is true. There's a desire to work together.\par \par \uc2 Any connection in this respect with Italian football?\par \par \uc2 There's some truth in the idea that being a conductor is not dissimilar to being the manager of an elite football team. You've always got certain star performers with specific gifts who have to be handled in a particular way. You can't put them in a straitjacket. You have to focus them all while letting them have their freedom. If a player has a big solo coming up, you have to give them the space to explore the music. It's a difficult balance.\par \par \uc2 In Italy opera was always the art form for the masses. Why has it become elite - in the UK, anyway?\par \par \uc2 It's still a popular art form in Italy, though for the past 20 years or so Italian opera houses have been stagnating - money issues, union problems, a lack of adventure, bored audiences. I've said often enough that opera houses in Italy have to reinvent themselves. But people are fearful of change. If you look at the Royal Opera House in London, audiences are pouring in, upstairs too, where the seats are cheaper but the sound is better. This elitist label is tiresome. Opera is so visceral, so emotional - and so incredibly thrilling when it's good.\par \par \uc2 In Germany you are quite likely to go to the opera and see Angela Merkel in the audience. And in Italy all the top politicians turn out for the opening night of La Scala. Politics and music in England?\par \par \uc2 Not too good. I wish politicians would be open to what's going on in the arts - they could learn so much in every way. Theatre, opera, concerts are brain-openers as well as heart-openers. Instead they seem scared to show their faces.\par \par \uc2 Have you met the new minister of culture, Sajid Javid?\par \par \uc2 No! But I have been out of the country for more than a month. . .\par \par \uc2 What is a golden voice in opera? Most people would think this still means Pavarotti? Is it God-given?\par \par \uc2 Great singers are those who project their voice, but also their personality and the essence of what's behind the words they sing. That's why Pavarotti was such a star. My father was a tenor so I'm fascinated by the struggles and qualities of that voice range. The singers I grew up listening to - Corelli, Del Monaco, Di Stefano - and others like Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras all had that dual ability. To ping the voice out and the emotion too: that's the package.\par \par \uc2 You've been outspoken on the question of young singers being pushed and then having to cancel. . .\par \par \uc2 Quite a few journalists attacked me for my remarks but not one singer. Life in general is more stressful than it ever was. Everything is more, more, more. With singers it's sooner, faster, louder. If something I said was heard, I am glad. The cancellations won't stop. I've had to cancel myself - when I had tennis elbow and couldn't conduct. It's to do with knowing when work becomes overwork. If I'm preaching, I'm preaching as much to myself as anyone.\par \par \uc2 Are you a workaholic? Do you fidget at the word "relaxation"?\par \par \uc2 I'm very good at relaxing! I've set up my life to be a workaholic but that means being able to switch off too. Reading, which requires silence and solitude, is my big thing, especially long novels. I've just finished Bleak House. And I've been reading the Russians - Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev.\par \par \uc2 At least Turgenev novels are short. . .\par \par \uc2 Yes but wow, they are dense. Maybe I need that kind of escape. . .\par \par \uc2 As if you don't get enough in opera plots. . .\par \par \uc2 Maybe that's the way I like it!\par \par \uc2 I've heard you're quite keen on Beyonce? And Tony Bennett and Bill Evans - your Desert Island Discs favourite. High art? Low art? Are you at heart a rock'n'roller?\par \par \uc2 I grew up in the 1970s so the names of bands like Earth, Wind and Fire, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, or singers like David Bowie, are part of my life. My interest is only in good music. How singers survive. . . why they survive. But really, I don't spend all my day listening to Beyonce.\par \par \uc2 You've spent quite a lot of time early in your career playing as a lounge-bar pianist. That old Broadway and jazz classics repertoire is in your bloodstream. . .\par \par \uc2 Yes, it's there in my background. You never know, if my conducting career goes down the tubes, you might find me there at the back of some cocktail bar, tinkling away.\par \par \uc2 Antonio Pappano\uc2  conducts the Orchestra and Chorus of Santa Cecilia at Symphony Hall, Birmingham on 16 May and the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 on 17 & 18 May\par \par \uc2 Caption:\par \par \uc2 Antonio Pappano\uc2  at the Royal Opera House.

\par\par \uc2 Observer Magazine Pages\par \b \uc2 Observer Magazine: Billie's next trick: Billie Piper has been a pop star, teen bride and acclaimed actor... So what's next after Belle de Jour? A Victorian prostitute. Megan Conner talks to her about fame, family and her restless spirit\b0\par\par\uc2 Megan Conner   \par \uc2 1,841 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Billie Piper is talking about "special effects" and "action sequences" with all the enthusiasm you would expect from someone who has signed up to make a multimillion-pound TV series airing on both sides of the Atlantic. She can riff on the show's main themes and the script - and we are just getting on to the point about the "dexterous text" when she says: "I'm sure this is all really boring. I play a prostitute. I'm just in it for the sex!"\par \par \uc2 Piper has an excellent sense of humour: a mischievous giggle, a willingness to sacrifice her point for the sake of a good joke. It's why she's so brilliant on chat shows - the last time I saw her, on Alan Carr's Chatty Man, she imitated a dance move popularised in the Channel 4 series My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding for laughs. She also told of how she had recently found a "filthy nightclub" on a night off from looking after her sons, making me wonder if Billie Piper is still quite the wild child.\par \par \uc2 She's certainly played a few of them on screen. Just three years after hanging up the whip she wielded while playing hooker Belle de Jour in ITV's Secret Diary of a Call Girl, Piper is back simulating sex on film sets for a major new TV series. Set in Victorian London, Penny Dreadful is a big production, a 10-part thriller written by \uc2 John Logan\uc2  and executive produced by Sam Mendes. As Piper explains, it's "a more darkly dressed version" of a period drama: "Savage and gory. Loads of blood. Loads of sex." It certainly has more of the spirit of Game of Thrones than Downton Abbey (and, like GoT, it is filmed on an enormous set in Dublin).\par \par \uc2 It also features a roster of international stars, including Timothy Dalton, Josh Hartnett and Eva Green, who - with Piper - play the series' principal characters. The rest of the roles are based on popular literary characters from the time: Dorian Gray, Mina Harker, Victor Frankenstein. It's a brilliant mash-up: she plays an Irish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  called Brona Croft who speaks with a thick Belfast accent. Nude or not, Piper manages to be both gregarious and vulnerable and steals the show in pretty much every scene she's in.\par \par \uc2 I'm assuming that by now Piper has no problem with sex scenes. This month she will also star in Foxtrot, a 30-minute film written for the Sky Arts Playhouse Presents strand by young playwright Polly Stenham (who won rave reviews for her Royal Court debut That Face at the age of 19). In what's becoming a "bit of a running theme", Piper is playing another prostitute. "I don't know why I'm always asked - I try not to overthink it," she laughs.\par \par \uc2 It was the abstractness and theatricality of the Playhouse series - now in its third run, with a cast as diverse as Matthew Perry and Cara Delevigne - that attracted Piper to it, along with the opportunity to work directly with two other actors, Lindsay Duncan and Ben Whishaw, who have won plaudits for their stagework.\par \par \uc2 Having starred in two plays in 2012 and 2013 - Reasons to be Pretty at the Almeida and The Effect at the National Theatre (she was nominated for an Olivier for the latter) - Piper has got the bug: "I think I just enjoy getting slightly wound up," she says, not entirely messing around. "To me, going to the theatre every night and putting myself through that process is like a strange sort of drug."\par \par \uc2 She is looking to do another play this year. She has signed a big contract for Penny Dreadful, so it might be challenging; if the show gets re-commissioned, she says it could become her "life for the next six or seven years". I wonder how she feels about that: earlier in our chat she had described her struggle playing Rose Tyler, the first assistant of the revived Doctor Who, for two years, remembering it as "almost impossible. It was very hard to have a life and take care of my family because I was always away in Cardiff. Also, it was a totally different level of fame. I don't miss that, myself."\par \par \uc2 If you only knew the bare facts about Piper, it might be hard to swallow the idea that she could be turned off by too much notoriety. This is the girl who left her hometown, Swindon, at the age of 12 to go to the Sylvia Young stage school in London, and was on TV three years later, blowing bubblegum in an advert for Smash Hits magazine. Pretty soon after that, at 15, she launched a pop career and had her first number one hit with "Because We Want To" in 1998. This feat made her the youngest debut artist in history to top the charts.\par \par \uc2 In 2001 Piper sensationally quit music to elope with Chris Evans, 16 years her senior, and was frequently pictured in the tabloids with him on boozy benders. They married when Piper was 18 - in Vegas - in what appeared to be the ultimate act of rebellion. But Piper maintained that they were in love, even if she did feel a compulsion to escape the pressures of a pop career that she'd ignited so young.\par \par \uc2 As we have seen in the reality series The Big Reunion, up for a Bafta this year, this was an era of pop that was incredibly tough. Given that the show has featured so many of Piper's peers (including her ex-fiance, Ritchie Neville, from the boy band 5ive), has she been tempted to watch?\par \par \uc2 "I did see a few minutes of the first series," she shudders, slightly clamming up. "But I just couldn't watch it without feeling incredibly tense." She sighs. "It was such a rough ride for a lot of people at the time. . . the industry was such a beast and it was making so much money - for everyone but the acts. And the truth of it was that they worked you like dogs."\par \par \uc2 She talks about "the ambition of children" in conjunction with the greed of music bosses. Is she saying that they were partly to blame? "We were just kids, but we were out there, going: 'Love me, love me, love me.' And we were impressed, like: 'Wow, I was just doing a paper round and now I'm doing the Smash Hits tour.'"\par \par \uc2 Piper claims not to have kept in touch with anyone from that time, "because we weren't friends. We were just five years of passing ships. My friends were my dancers, or my family."\par \par \uc2 Now 31, her personal life has changed dramatically in the past few years. In 2007 she married the scion of the Fox acting dynasty, Lewis actor \uc2 Laurence Fox\uc2 , with whom she now has two children, Winston, five, and Eugene, two. In place of a wedding ring she has the letters F-O-X tattooed on her finger. The two lead characters in Stenham's Playhouse play are called Fox and Badger. Is she playing Fox? "No, I'm called Badger," she grins. "Which I love. I love that name." For a girl or a boy? "For a girl, but then she'd be Badger Fox. Or maybe Badge. . . But no! I don't think we could."\par \par \uc2 Relatively recently, the Fox clan moved back to London (although they still go back to their home in the country regularly) for work. "I've been flying to Dublin back and forth and Laurence has been in plays." This was after Piper had a spell at home with her children - "for quite a long time, really". Was she tempted to stay and quit acting, the way Lily Allen vowed to quit music? "I think if you're creative that's a bit unrealistic. You can't stamp it out. But of course there are times when I am like: 'I hate this!' and I just want to be with my children in peace and quiet. But everybody has that. And there are other days where you go: 'Ooh, what if I did that. . .'"\par \par \uc2 In addition to acting - which Piper will have been doing for a decade this year - she has other creative ambitions. "There are some other areas I would like to explore," she says coyly, "but I don't really want to discuss them, because it's just pressure to make them real." But is it safe to say she wouldn't go back to music? "Yes.\par \par \uc2 Definitely not. That much is true." So does she want to be a breakdancer or something? "No," she laughs. "But I would love my children to do that."\par \par \uc2 The constant changes in direction, the flitting between artforms, her kaleidoscopic public life/career. . . A psychologist would say that she doesn't like to be pigeonholed.\par \par \uc2 "I would like to know what a psychologist has to say about it, actually," Piper bats back. "It might be very helpful." Has she ever seen one? "I did, when I was young. I just found the whole thing really unhelpful and I felt like [the psychologist] wasn't telling me anything I didn't already know about myself. It was. . . very shortsighted. It was at the beginning of a process that I opted out from. So, you know, maybe [I did that] unfairly."\par \par \uc2 She doesn't think she has any major psychological problems to fix, though? "I think I'm restless. . . as a person." Always? "Yeah." Does that make her worry? "Yeah. But I just think you're either wired that way or you're not. Members of my family are like that as well."\par \par \uc2 "It's funny," she adds, "because maybe you just have to accept that that's your lot - that you're like that." I think it's more funny that she's using the phrase "accept your lot" to validate her sense of adventure, her desire to break her own norms. "But maybe I will just settle one day," she says. "Who knows?"\par \par \uc2 Knowing the Billie Piper we have seen so far, it's unlikely.\par \par \uc2 Penny Dreadful starts on Sky Atlantic later this month.

\par\par \uc2 Observer Home News Pages\par \b \uc2 Bankers, house prices ... and hedgehogs: the capital as you have never seen it before: The London Mapper website, launched today, gives a stark illustration of the city's social, political and demographic dividing lines\b0\par\par\uc2 by Daniel Boffey, Policy Editor   \par \uc2 1,042 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It is a London that few have seen before. Hundreds of impenetrable sets of data about the capital - its people, property, burgeoning numbers of bankers and its haemorrhaging of hedgehogs - have been mapped to be brought alive, researchers hope, in a project that has been two years in the making.\par \par \uc2 Professor Danny Dorling's London Mapper, to be launched online today, is intended to draw attention to the capital's extreme financial and social divides, while illuminating its trends, population movements and economic endeavours in a way that will be accessible to an audience beyond the confines of the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Each of London's boroughs, or wards, depending on the map, has been made smaller or larger, depending on the issue being number-crunched, illustrating stark differences across 300 topics.\par \par \uc2 For all the warnings of a housing price bubble, and the countless statistics cited by estate agents to prove the point, a map highlighting London's increase in property values from 2012 to 2013 compared with the rest of England and Wales tells the story of the recent property boom more eloquently than most.\par \par \uc2 "It jumps out of the page at you," said Mubin Haq, director of policy and grants at the Trust for London charity, which has funded the project. "It shows what is happening in a way that the figures cannot do."\par \par \uc2 London emerges, swirling out, pushing up the property values of satellite areas, driven by an epicentre of wealth in Kensington and Chelsea and in Westminster - larger than the rest of the boroughs to signify their affluence. The total value of housing has increased by pounds 1bn in Kensington and Chelsea and pounds 921m in Westminster between 2012 and 2013.\par \par \uc2 "London is very different," Haq said. "There are huge differences compared with the rest of the country but there are just as significant disparities within London. Lots of people in London aren't sharing in the wealth we see in the property-value map.\par \par \uc2 "The homelessness map is interesting. Where have we seen the greatest increase in sales value in housing? One of the boroughs that stands out is Westminster. But where have we got the largest number of homeless people? That very same borough."\par \par \uc2 In the map of homelessness, based on counts and estimates of rough sleeping in autumn 2013, London appears almost as a black hole, with Westminster in dark blue, dominant at the centre. Around 140 rough sleepers are estimated to live in Westminster, according to the \uc2 Department for Communities and Local Government\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Two boroughs - Barking and Dagenham, and Sutton - disappear from the capital because there are believed to be no rough sleepers there.\par \par \uc2 Skip to maps documenting where particular ethnic groups or people of particular faiths have settled and London looks very different. There are just 263 Sikhs in Kensington and Chelsea, out of a population of more than 158,000, meaning the borough is crushed to its east and west on the map.\par \par \uc2 To the north, more than 54,000 Jews live in Barnet alone, but there are only about 9,000 south of the Thames, according to the 2011 census.\par \par \uc2 Dorling, who was aided in his mapping by Dr Benjamin Hennig of \uc2 Oxford University\uc2 's school of geography, said: "You can also see a move of Jewish people back to the east of London, where they were 100 years ago. They almost entirely left the East End as new \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  came in, but young people from that community are not moving back as it is becoming gentrified."\par \par \uc2 It is not only people that are mapped. The geography of peregrine falcons, stag beetles, muntjac deer and even hedgehogs has a place on the site. The 1,272 sightings of hedgehogs in Richmond upon Thames last year hugely distorts London's familiar features. In contrast, there were no sightings in the City, only one in Tower Hamlets and five in Kensington and Chelsea.\par \par \uc2 It is unlikely to hinge on the hedgehog map, but Dorling hopes the London Mapper will be as big a success as its forerunner, the World Mapper, which mapped the globe according to indices such as GDP per capita and life expectancy.\par \par \uc2 Dorling said: "When we started putting stuff out there in 2006 on World Mapper we expected some small academic interest. It has now had something like 26m hits. It nearly brought down the server at \uc2 Sheffield University\uc2  where I was then working."\par \par \uc2 London Mapper will continue to grow, potentially to hold three times more maps, building on a database that covers everything from obesity to car ownership and income.\par \par \uc2 "You will be able to see the housing bubble inflate," said Dorling. "You can show people the numbers and they switch off. But these maps are like fancy pie charts, and if something is twice the size of something else it is obvious. We just want to spark a debate about the differences in one big city.\par \par \uc2 "London was the obvious city to do because it is the one on which we probably have more quality data than anywhere else. That's partly because the British are obsessed with collecting numbers. The next step is to do continental Europe and other major cities.\par \par \uc2 "I think the maps will work for people under a certain age - 35 or under in particular. There is an incredible increase in capacity to understand abstract concepts, images and maps, generation by generation. We can do things now for the public that we would have shown only in a university hall 20 or 30 years ago."\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Danny Dorling and his team working on London Mapper have taken tables of data on hundreds of different social issues and created maps that are distorted according to what the numbers mean; for example, if it is much more expensive to rent in Westminster than in Ealing, then the borough of Westminster will be stretched and bigger on the map than Ealing. The large number of hedgehog sightings in Richmond distorts the familiar geography.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140512ea5b00024\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Only one in 10 UK voters say they can name a member of the European parliament in their region, and even fewer have ever contacted one, according to a new poll that highlights widespread public disengagement with the EU.\par \par \uc2 The Opinium/Observer survey, conducted a fortnight before European elections later this month, shows that people are five times more likely to be able to name their local MP than any of their MEPs.\par \par \uc2 Just 11% say they would be confident of naming one of their MEPs, against 52% who say they could name their MP and 31% who could name one of their local or county councillors. Just 8% say they have made contact with an MEP, while 79% say they have never considered doing so.\par \par \uc2 While there is clearly a low level of engagement with MEPs, the poll shows that more people (43%) think the European parliament is important in the way Britain is governed than those who think it is unimportant (37%).\par \par \uc2 With turnout in the European elections likely to be low - in 2009 it was just 34% - the findings will alarm members of the EU establishment who fear that voter apathy and lack of involvement with the European project is allowing anti-EU forces such as Nigel Farage's Ukip to gain a bigger foothold in the European parliament.\par \par \uc2 Today a special Observer report shows anti-EU sentiment is also on the rise throughout the continent. Brussels is braced for a historic breakthrough for Eurosceptic parties in this month's elections, as polls across the EU show they could obtain as much as 30% of the vote and up to 200 MEPs.\par \par \uc2 The Front National leads French polls, having campaigned on a platform of withdrawal from the euro and a crackdown on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . The party's leader, Marine Le Pen, and the Dutch far-right populist Geert Wilders are hoping to form a new anti-EU alliance of at least seven parties within the European parliament.\par \par \uc2 The grouping could include the Flemish nationalists of Vlaams Belang and the Italian separatists of the Northern League. Meanwhile, the Italian comic Beppe Grillo's grassroots Five Star Movement, which is campaigning for an Italian referendum on the euro, is on course to win 25% of the vote and send more than 20 MEPs to the Strasbourg parliament. In the last European elections in 2009, Ukip won 13 seats and could double that number in these elections with a share of the vote that could be as high as 30%.\par \par \uc2 In today's report on the rise of Euroscepticism, the celebrated Italian satirist and playwright Dario Fo backs Grillo's calls for a referendum on the single currency.\par \par \uc2 Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and leader of the Liberal group in Strasbourg, told the Observer: "You will see a kind of victory for the Eurosceptics in the election. But that will hopefully lead to the emergence of a pro-European electorate and eventually to the new leap forward that we need."\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140512ea5b0001u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer In Focus Pages\par \b \uc2 In Focus: EU elections: A postwar dream of a united Europe is fading in the face of bitter hostility from left and right. How did the EU lose its way? And what can save it?: The \uc2 European Union\uc2  was designed to bind in peace a continent ravaged by the second world war. It transformed Europe politically and economically but is now under fierce attack. Opponents rage at waste, austerity economics, a democratic deficit and erosion of sovereignty. Before next week's Euro elections Julian Coman travels to Italy, France and Belgium to find out: is this the end of the postwar dream?\b0\par\par\uc2 Julian Coman   \par \uc2 5,781 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 30\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Entering the central courtyard of the European parliament in Strasbourg, the visitor is surrounded by a collection of giant larger-than-life posters from which smiling faces gaze out. One striking, bohemian-looking couple catch the eye. "On 22 May," reads the legend above their black fedora hats, "Jens and Sedsel will choose who's in charge in Europe. And you?" Below their feet is the slogan: "European elections 22 May 2014. Act. React. Impact."\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the Strasbourg assembly should be careful what it wishes for. Jens and Sedsel may be signed up to the programme. But across the continent, those who may not have the best interests of the \uc2 European Union\uc2  at heart are marching on the parliament, from both the right and left of the political spectrum. The insurgents are certainly looking to "act, react and impact", but not in the way that the designers of the Strasbourg posters may have hoped.\par \par \uc2 In Britain, Ukip's Nigel Farage, pint in hand, has already pulled British politics to a place close to the EU exit door. But euroscepticism is no longer a curiosity of these islands. Marine Le Pen, leader of France's Front National, has even grander designs than Farage. Le Pen plans to use the forthcoming elections to form an alliance dedicated to wrecking the "monster in Brussels" from within. Her party is on course to top the polls in France.\par \par \uc2 In Italy, an ex-comic, Beppe Grillo, whose anti-establishment shtick has its origins in the anarchic left, ridicules the recent succession of Italian prime ministers who have "become the slaves of financial interests and economic decisions taken elsewhere". The Five-Star movement which he founded in 2007 is second in Italy's polls, predicted to win 25% of the vote. The Greek socialists of Syriza are riding high from Athens to Alexandroupoli on the back of a promise to roll back crushing EU-imposed debt repayments.\par \par \uc2 Even in the land of Borgen, where consensus politics provided an unlikely template for cult television viewing, rebellion is in the air. The Danish People's party - anti-EU, anti-multiculturalism and anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - is pledging to "assert Denmark's independence and to guarantee the freedom of the Danish people in their own country". The DPP, which like Ukip has profited from popular resentment at the extension of welfare benefits to \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  workers, sits in first place in the polls, also with a share of 25%. In the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, and across much of eastern Europe, it is a similar story.\par \par \uc2 Two weeks from the elections, it seems possible - probable even - that Eurosceptic parties could gain up to a third of the total vote and up to 200 of the 751 seats in the next European parliament. Given that less than half of the Union's electorate are likely to vote at all, those figures suggest an overwhelming majority of Europeans are either apathetic towards the ongoing project of a common borderless European home or actively hostile. Never mind Jens and Sedsel. If they were still among us, Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, Altiero Spinelli, founding fathers all of the EU, might be wondering: "How did Europe lose its way?"\par \par \uc2 Left behind in the 'global race'\par \par \uc2 EU officials in search of an answer could do worse than travel to Forbach in the region of Lorraine, at the historic core of the union. A former mining town, Forbach was there at the birth of the European dream, one of the dynamos of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) brought into being after the war by victorious France and defeated Germany\par \par \uc2 The ECSC, proposed by Robert Schuman, the French foreign minister at the time, and inspired by the visionary French diplomat Jean Monnet, was created in 1951 by Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The unprecedented pooling of sovereignty over vital resources was a statement of intent: the western half of a devastated continent was determined that the wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45 should never be repeated. By 1957 the ECSC had morphed into the European Economic Community, or Common Market, and the road to the \uc2 European Union\uc2  had begun. But six decades on, blue-collar Forbach is no longer a showcase for the federal dreams of Schuman and Monnet. In fact, it's about to vote heavily for the self-styled patriots of the FN.\par \par \uc2 The last mine here closed in 2004 and nothing much has taken its place as France has been gripped by economic stagnation and austerity following the crash of 2009. At the well-funded Musee les Mineurs, newsreels from the postwar glory days are shown on a constant loop. A narrator in 1947 asks: "How could the miners not feel proud of what they represent? The reconstruction of France!" But in the Forbach of 2014 unemployment stands at 14% and is far higher among the young. Vandalism and car-burning is common in the town's bleak suburbs, where refugees and migrants now occupy the postwar estates built for generations of miners. Shops, cafes, even the last bookshop, have disappeared. The town is dying.\par \par \uc2 The sorry tale of decline is repeated in industrial and manufacturing towns across the EU, where the economic crisis of the last five years has finished off communities that were already losing their place in the new global economic order. China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam are where the new Forbachs are to be found. Ageing, economically insecure and fearful for the future, more and more Europeans are listening to populist calls for retrenchment behind old borders and old certainties. A generosity of spirit towards the outsider is being replaced by an embittered "welfare chauvinism", and an insistence that French, Danish, Austrian or British workers come first.\par \par \uc2 In March's mayoral elections in Forbach, the FN's plausible vice-president, Florian Philippot, won the first round of voting, before losing narrowly in the runoff against the incumbent Socialist, Laurent Kalinowski. In the European poll Philippot is all but certain to become an MEP for the region, elected on a platform of reinstituting border controls, withdrawal from the euro and French jobs for French workers.\par \par \uc2 A graduate of the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the breeding ground for France's political elite, Philippot represents a new generation of FN politician, which came of age during "La Crise". A youthful, articulate 35-year-old, he is a far cry from the motley crew of neo-fascists who used to assemble under the banner of Jean-Marie Le Pen. Philippot's political hero is General Charles de Gaulle.\par \par \uc2 "The surge in support for the FN is a protest vote, a cry of pain," says Jean-Claude Flauss, a retired archivist and local historian. "What is being done to this town is shameful. A population, having been exploited, is now being left to rot; a community is in the process of being dismantled. And a place which gave so much, which gave so many resources and so much wealth, is being abandoned to its fate."\par \par \uc2 Flauss insists that xenophobia is not behind the local support for Philippot, although he says the decision to place hundreds of refugees in the town's struggling suburbs has been "a problem to add to all the others". In the "global race" constantly invoked by Europe's politicians, Forbach feels ignored, forgotten and left behind.\par \par \uc2 "The people of Forbach are not racist," says Flauss. "This has always been a place that welcomed strangers. In the 1920s it was the Italians who came. They fled Mussolini to come and work in the mines. They arrived with helmets in their hands, ready to work. In the 1930s it was the Polish. After the war, workers arrived from the Maghreb. This is a place with a history of openness and tolerance. No one really thinks withdrawing from the euro would be practical. Over 100,000 people cross the borders around here to work. But it's not hard to see why the FN would want to implant themselves in the town. People are desperate and want to show the world they are very, very fed up."\par \par \uc2 Emil Dolic's father was one of those foreigners who came to work in the local pit, fleeing Tito's Yugoslavia in 1958. Dolic himself worked down Forbach's mine for 25 years, having grown up in the suburb of Behren-les-Forbach, where last month disaffected youth attacked the mayor's offices and the town was woken up by circling police helicopters. He thinks Philippot is a "good man - not like Jean-Marie Le Pen who was just crazy", but cannot bring himself to vote FN. But he is deeply pessimistic about the future of the country that gave his father a new start: "The Chinese can do everything more cheaply now and they don't have the welfare costs to worry about. We can't compete with them. When people are vulnerable and suffering, that's when the FN can exploit the situation."\par \par \uc2 Throughout the region, Marine Le Pen's party is doing just that. In nearby Hayange, the famous Florange steelworks closed a year ago when the Indian steel magnate \uc2 Lakshmi Mittal\uc2  took his investment elsewhere. An FN mayor - a former radical socialist - has just been elected there.\par \par \uc2 Nationalism reborn?\par \par \uc2 At the Front National's annual May Day parade in Paris, the talk is of France's latest industrial embarrassment: the potential sale of another "national champion", the energy and transport giant \uc2 Alstom\uc2 , to America's \uc2 General Electric\uc2 . Lorraine loyalists are out in force. The favoured chant of the day is "On est chez nous!" ("We are in our own home!") which reverberates through a marching crowd drawn from Provence, Franche-Comte, Burgundy and beyond. The slogan is an angry assertion of what should be the case but isn't, as open markets and cheap labour from eastern Europe allegedly cut a swath through traditional French life.\par \par \uc2 Among the ancient flags of Brittany and the Vendee and the fleur-de-lis which is a traditional symbol of French royalism, other banners ram home more contemporary points: "Europe is our prison!", "- EU and + France", "They toast each other in Brussels at our expense!"\par \par \uc2 Walking past the Palais Royal, a new chant goes up: "Ni gauche ni droite: Front National!" ("Neither left nor right: Front National.") Thierry Gaulot, a newly elected FN council member for Metz, around 35 miles from Forbach, insists that this is no longer about the old preoccupations of the French royalist right. In its efforts to break through, the FN has gone ecumenical, both at home and abroad, where it hopes to become the standard-bearer of a new "Europe des Peuples".\par \par \uc2 "This is now a party that is based on a patriotism that can appeal to the left as much as the right," Gaulot says. "There are plenty who have joined us from parties of the left. Nigel Farage says we are antisemitic? People who talk about racism or fascism are just not opening their minds. Listen to that chant, 'on est chez nous'. It's about sovereignty; about the global economy being run on the terms of the multinationals who can up sticks to go where they can make more profit."\par \par \uc2 When Marine Le Pen appears to speak in the Place de l'Opera, she is dressed in marine blue. Behind her is a backdrop depicting a giant Joan of Arc, blowing away the yellow stars of the \uc2 European Union\uc2  flag. Le Pen has big ambitions for these elections, hoping to use the Eurosceptic surge across the continent to form an "enemy within" the European parliament, in alliance with the Dutch far-right Freedom party leader, Geert Wilders. To form a "European Freedom Alliance" in Strasbourg, she and Wilders will require a minimum of 25 MEPs from seven member states. Up to now, Farage has insisted that Ukip will not be joining. But the Austrian Freedom party and Vlaams Belang, the Flemish nationalist party, both appear to be on board. The Danish People's party and Italy's Northern League are also allies. Judging by the current polls, the threshold of 25 MEPs will be easily crossed.\par \par \uc2 Once installed, the alliance will become an awkward, obstructionist presence, committed, in the words of the Northern League's Matteo Salvini, to "a different Europe, based on work and peoples and not in the one based on servitude to the euro and banks, ready to let us die from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and unemployment".\par \par \uc2 In Paris, in a Wagnerian downpour, Le Pen laments the betrayal of France. She inveighs against the "gravediggers" of Brussels, whose austerity measures are held responsible for the scourge of mass unemployment and economic stagnation. France's new Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, is denounced for introducing a new round of cuts - euros 11bn from welfare payments, euros 10bn from healthcare - in order to lower France's budget deficit to satisfy the European commission. "Manuel Valls has no idea how to govern France," Le Pen tells the crowd. "The destiny of this country is being decided in Brussels." President \uc2 Francois Hollande\uc2  is little more than "the little governor of the province of France".\par \par \uc2 At the same time, she says, mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , attributed to the EU's "ultra-liberalism", is undermining the nation's sense of identity. \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  must accommodate to French culture, not the other way round. "The French people no longer control anything: banks, money, borders." The coming EU-US trade deal is an invitation to American farmers to put their French equivalents out of business.\par \par \uc2 "States have a lot in common with human beings," Le Pen concludes. "A state which controls nothing becomes a depressed state." As the microphone conks out in the deluge, she joins the crowd in an impromptu mass rendition of La Marseillaise. Then there is one final message for Brussels: "In other countries, other peoples are rallying to our side. We want to build a Europe of free and sovereign nations. A Europe of peoples."\par \par \uc2 A strange kind of democracy\par \par \uc2 It was an early 19th-century utopian socialist who first dreamed up the idea of a European parliament. As the continent suffered the ravages of the Napoleonic wars, Henri de Saint-Simon pleaded for the creation of an elite assembly to run the continent along less sanguinary lines. The body would be attended by 21 "delegates of humanity" - a council of experts selected in England, France, Germany and Italy. "As soon as elections have been held to the Supreme Council and to the Councils of individual nations", wrote Saint-Simon, "the scourge of war will be banished from Europe."\par \par \uc2 The modest dimensions of that original vision now seem somewhat quaint. Directly elected since 1979, the EU's parliament is a Goliath among the world's democratic fora. In two weeks' time, 750 MEPs and one president will be elected to represent an estimated electorate of 501 million people in 28 countries. However, the ways of the EP have provided some open goals to its critics.\par \par \uc2 The parliament has no tax-raising powers but rewards its representatives with a notoriously handsome package of salaries, expenses and grants. There is little obligation to furnish receipts. And Farage, recently embarrassed over the hiring of his German wife as a secretary, is not the only MEP to discover that a seat in the European parliament can become a family concern.\par \par \uc2 Good ideas at the time have become expensive anomalies. In recognition of the historic reconciliation between France and Germany after the second world war, MEPs still trek once a month from Brussels to the parliament's official seat in Strasbourg, at a cost of euros 180m a year. Acknowledging that such needless expense is meat and drink to enemies of the European idea, MEPs led by the parliament's vice-president, Edward McMillan-Scott, have launched a "Single Seat" campaign to abandon "Alcatraz", as the Strasbourg building is known to some of its inmates. But such gripes are small beer compared to the biggest problem for the parliament: a continuing lack of credibility among the electorates of Europe.\par \par \uc2 The two major groupings in the assembly, the centre-right European People's party (EPP) and centre-left Socialists and Democrats (PES) have little purchase on voters who tend, when they vote at all, to use the quinquennial polls as an opportunity to sound off at domestic governments.\par \par \uc2 MEPs have no power to initiate legislation, which is the unelected European commission's job.\par \par \uc2 During the three-year melodrama of the eurozone crisis, they were concerned bystanders as the "troika", composed of the commission, the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  and the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2 , imposed an eye-watering level of austerity in bailed-out and indebted member states such as Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, where youth unemployment rates have soared above 50% in some regions.\par \par \uc2 Endlessly, parliamentarians have battled for a greater say, recently gaining new legal powers over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and policing. And they did eventually show their teeth over the troika, releasing a highly critical report in March. MEPs' support was also crucial in establishing a eurozone banking union designed to avoid taxpayer bailouts of banks in the future. But if the EU's elected body could not directly determine policy during the biggest crisis in the union's history, some might ask, what is the point of it?\par \par \uc2 The steady decline in poll turnout, from 63% in 1979 to a miserable 43% five years ago, suggests a growing number of potential voters have come to the conclusion that there isn't one. Among the under-25s in 2009, the abstention rate was a damning and surely unsustainable 71%. As the European Freedom Alliance of Le Pen and Wilders prepares to embark on a wrecking mission in the parliament, it feels like a turning-point in the history of a much-lampooned institution.\par \par \uc2 "Somehow we need to create a European Demos, a European consciousness," says Anni Podimata, a Greek socialist who belongs to the centre-left grouping. "At a national level we need to explain properly the challenges and benefits of Europe." But how?\par \par \uc2 Searching for the great\par \par \uc2 leap forward\par \par \uc2 How about the first-ever European presidential debates? Last month citizens of Maastricht out for a stroll were treated to an unusual sight in the town's main square. In front of the Vrijthof theatre, a modest crowd was assembled, soon to be scattered by the arrival of a dark blue coach. Emblazoned across the front of vehicle in huge white letters was the single word "Juncker". This was the campaign battlebus of Jean-Claude Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg and EPP candidate for the plum role of European commission president.\par \par \uc2 As the much-discussed "democratic deficit" at the heart of the EU has become a crisis in the age of austerity, the debates are an attempt at a bailout. Or, as the Brussels-sponsored Debating Europe website puts it: "The \uc2 European Union\uc2  is run by unelected bureaucrats right? Well it's not so simple . . . for the first time ever the European parliament will be putting forward candidates for position of the European commission president, giving citizens a real say in who runs the EU's executive arm."\par \par \uc2 There are six candidates, including Martin Schulz of the PES, the liberal Guy Verhofstadt and, presumably hoping to cause trouble, Alexis Tsipras, the socialist scourge of Brussels-inspired cuts in Greece. The winner will be the candidate whose parliamentary group secures the most votes later this month.\par \par \uc2 Who knew? Certainly not the average Labour voter, because Ed Miliband has run a mile from Schulz, whose federalist vision of the EU's future goes way beyond the pale for British consumption in the Ukip era. Labour dissociated the party from Schulz's campaign, saying: "Martin Schulz's political priorities in Europe do not represent those of the Labour party. While not being able to support the PES common candidate for this year's election, we continue to support the principle of having common candidates."\par \par \uc2 The day after the debate, Guy Verhofstadt is in a chipper mood. Once the enfant terrible of politics in Belgium, where he was a youthful prime minister for nine years, the polls show him as the clear winner of the evening. "It's great that this is taking place," he says. "It's never happened in 20 years. For the first time a democratic European debate is emerging on the future of Europe."\par \par \uc2 Verhofstadt is a founding member of the Spinelli Group, named after the dissident Italian communist who, during the second world war, produced a manifesto for a federal union across the European continent. Founded in 2010, the group calls for a revival of "the European spirit". But Verhofstadt admits that the union has an image problem. "What is it? Is it a confederation or a federation. Is it intergovernmental, or is it communitarian. Is it a group of 6, 9, 12, 15, 17 or more? Who is in the Schengen agreement [to abolish internal borders] and who isn't? Who is in the euro and who isn't? Who is opting out of that and who is opting into this? It's overly complex."\par \par \uc2 For Verhofstadt, the mop-haired bespectacled face of radical federalism for over a decade, there is, however, no going back. A driver of vintage racing cars for a hobby, he believes that only a future United States of Europe can compete in the global race with China, India and the other emerging economies of Asia. If places such as Forbach are to thrive in the 21st century, "you have to reinvent the idea of sovereignty".\par \par \uc2 "It's no answer for nation states to retreat behind their own borders," he continues. "The eurosceptics have no solutions, just scapegoats. Take energy. America has a common energy policy and they are net exporters. Europe has 28 different energy policies. That gives America a competitive advantage. Show me the person who will say, 'I want to hold onto national sovereignty even if it means higher prices.'"\par \par \uc2 When it comes to the great austerity plan, he insists there was no alternative. The cost of borrowing in heavily indebted countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy had become unsustainable. "Budget discipline was necessary and debts had to come down," says Verhofstadt. But the savage consequences of the cuts could and should have been mitigated by more solidarity between states at EU level. "The Eurosceptics are right that the crisis has been badly handled. Austerity has been dictating policy, but we need to think about growth as well. We should be pooling the debt of eurozone states above 60% and we're not doing it".\par \par \uc2 The future must be about deeper integration. "It's not about a superstate. It's about more integration as the engine of growth, unified capital markets, a unified banking system, common debt in the eurozone. There's no credit union in the EU, so it's difficult to get credit in another country. That's crazy."\par \par \uc2 For those content that the eurozone should remain at the halfway house of a single currency with national markets, he has a dire prediction: "If in the end you don't fully integrate, then you may as well stop with the currency. And that would lead to the decline of Europe. The Europeans would not be able to compete with China and India."\par \par \uc2 Will anyone listen to Verhofstadt's warning? It is true that the history of EU integration is punctuated by crises that have not gone to waste. The horror of the second world war led to the founding of the Coal and Steel Community. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe saw the EU expand eastwards at breakneck speed. But in the Europe of 2014, evangelists of a United States of Europe will have to fight even to get a hearing. Alongside the resurgent nationalism on view in the northern capitals of London, Paris, Amsterdam and Copenhagen, new anti-politics movements are on the rise in the south, born out of frustration with all '"political elites", whether national or European.\par \par \uc2 Send in the clowns\par \par \uc2 Beppe Grillo has been described as "the most dangerous man in Europe" by the German magazine Der Spiegel. The rebarbative Italian comic took that as a compliment. For over a year, this satirist-turned-populist firebrand has been laying waste to the traditional landscape of Italian politics. Piazzas have filled from Sicily to Turin, as crowds have gathered to hear messianic calls for a new grassroots, web-based, democratic culture, and a bonfire of the vanities of Italy's corrupt political caste. Opponents accuse Grillo of a facile moralism and unappealing vulgarity - his rise began in earnest with the organisation of "Fuck Off Day" in 2007, which outed the numerous Italian parliamentarians carrying previous convictions. The comic's fierce hostility to organised political parties has even been compared to Mussolini's attacks on parliamentary democracy.\par \par \uc2 In February last year, Grillo's Five Star Movement - a loose network of local groups organised online around his own blog - gained an astonishing 26% of the vote at the Italian election. "Send in the clowns," ironised the Economist. This year the 65-year-old is taking on Brussels, wrapping himself - literally - in the EU flag and touring the country performing a vituperative one-man show entitled Te lo do io l'Europa ("I'll give you Europe").\par \par \uc2 Italians used to be the biggest Europe enthusiasts, seeing Brussels as a means of escape from the dysfunction of the state that gave the world \uc2 Silvio Berlusconi\uc2 . But the Europe described by Grillo to his audiences shares the DNA of the "eurocracy" presented to French voters by Marine Le Pen: anti-democratic and, in its pursuit of austerity, economically ruinous.\par \par \uc2 According to Grillo, from the moment the unelected former European commissioner Mario Monti was appointed prime minister of Italy in 2011, in the midst of the country's sovereign debt crisis, Brussels has controlled Italy's economic destiny. "It's not a mystery," Grillo writes in his blog, "that (national) governments are created and destroyed in Brussels. It's happened in Greece, in Portugal, and it's happening in Italy. Three Italian governments have been decided by the EU. We need to go into Europe to change Italy. Our prime ministers have become servants of financial interests and economic strategies decided elsewhere." The Five Star Movement is calling for a referendum on membership of the euro and an immediate end to the "fiscal compact" designed to ensure budget discipline in indebted EU states.\par \par \uc2 If the Five Star Movement can gain 20-30 seats in the Strasbourg parliament, Grillo reckons that "the current balance of power will be turned upside down". Polls suggest that, at around 25% of the vote, his candidates are on course to reach that target.\par \par \uc2 Grillo's MEPs will never join the nationalist front run by Le Pen and Wilders, but their presence in the parliament will open up another flank of dissent. While Europe's nationalist right is attempting to disinter the nation-state and relive the glory days of the postwar boom, the Five Star Movement has more in common with the anarchic radicalism of the Spanish indignados or the Occupy movement. The anger is representative of a generation of young Europeans who face lower living standards than their parents and little chance of finding a meaningful job.\par \par \uc2 In Ascoli Piceno, where Massimo Tamburri is standing as a mayoral candidate for the Five Star Movement, the youth unemployment rate is 47%. "The young are just condemned to stay with their families," he says. "There is just huge frustration. I have friends who have been in a relationship for five or six years but they still live with their parents."\par \par \uc2 Rome, says Tamburri, isn't working, and neither is Brussels as presently constituted. "It's not a community. It's not got an egalitarian politics. The only positive things - and they're not enough - are initiatives like the Erasmus student exchange programme and free movement within the union."\par \par \uc2 The celebrated satirist and Nobel prize winner Dario Fo - at 88 one of the grand old men of Italian culture - is one of Grillo's most impassioned supporters. Fo has spent a lifetime on the turbulent left of Italian politics, arguing with the fanatics of the Red Brigades in the 1970s and satirising the right in plays such as Chain Me Up and I'll Still Smash Everything. Now he says: "I'm not on the left. I'm a democrat."\par \par \uc2 Disillusioned with the broken promises and clientelism of mainstream parties, the cardinal virtues for Fo have become "civic commitment" and "honesty". At his summer home on the Adriatic coast, surrounded by his own paintings and photographs of his late wife, Franca Rame, he has been hosting political discussion groups on where the Five Star Movement goes next.\par \par \uc2 "I had a very lively meeting here yesterday," he says. "Fifty or so people came here, young men and women from Rimini, Ravenna, Cesena, and we talked about where we should go with this movement in which so much has happened so quickly".\par \par \uc2 "The Five Star Movement is the only means of climbing out of the pit," says Fo, "the only way of leaving behind the hypocrisy and the swindling in politics. In the eurozone crisis we know that there was speculation and that the banks were saved by the governments of various states. In Italy we've now had three governments without elections, and this was not a clean process. We were told that everyone had to make sacrifices to save our nation and then we see that it's the usual mugs who pay up: workers, small businessmen, students and pensioners and so on."\par \par \uc2 Fo backs the Five Star Movement's call for a referendum on the euro. "I don't know how I would vote in it. I would reflect for a while," he says. "But let's see what the referendum result would actually be, if it's positive or negative. Let's have some democracy here rather than have everything done behind closed doors."\par \par \uc2 As cultural grandees such as Fo bemoan the current state of "the project" along with thousands of younger activists an urgent defence may be required.\par \par \uc2 There are signs that one may be coming.\par \par \uc2 Who will stand up for 'Europe'?\par \par \uc2 Herman Van Rompuy, a man whose very name seems to provoke mirth in anglocentric circles, is known for composing the occasional haiku. But the Belgian president of the European Council - the intergovernmental apex of the EU - generally has the reputation of being the driest of dry sticks. To coincide with the coming elections, however, he has published a passionate defence of Europe and all, or most, of its works.\par \par \uc2 In Europe in the storm: Lessons and Challenges, Van Rompuy writes: "Even the eurosceptic voters don't want to return to the past. Who wants to go back to the old times, to the customs frontiers that existed before 1954? How many people really want to return to national currencies, after the crisis of the euro? Very few!\par \par \uc2 "People know very well that not only is there an added value, but also that Europe can never disappear again from their way of life. People have criticised, here and there, abuses linked to the free movement of people. But in the context of the whole acquis [accumulated legislation], that's ridiculous! The cost of no Europe would be enormous!"\par \par \uc2 Complacency or common sense? There is no doubt that "Europe", overwhelmingly, has been a force for good in the world, from the securing of the postwar peace, to the promotion of human rights, to the simple freedoms that allow a European to drive a car from Milan to Brussels without stopping at a single checkpoint.\par \par \uc2 Outside its borders, as the rush of post-communist states to join the EU demonstrated, Europe is usually seen as an attractive model of democratic decency. In an interview with the Belgian paper Le Soir, Van Rompuy noted: "In Africa . . . Europe is perceived as the homeland of democracy. The colonial Europe has been forgotten. There is a new Europe which is the biggest donor of development aid and which intervenes militarily only to help. What was our self-interest in intervening in the Central African Republic? None. We mustn't lose sight of this."\par \par \uc2 But even Van Rompuy would admit that recent post-crash history, to put it mildly, has soured the mood. In Brussels, as economic growth slowly returns, there is hope that spirits may lighten. One senior EU official, now retired but an influence in the commission's glory days under Jacques Delors, says: "I can see it now. The commission will be saying, 'O ye of little faith. It was unpopular, but austerity has worked. We're on the right track.'"\par \par \uc2 Perhaps. But the damage of the last few years has been colossal, as testified to by those extraordinary youth unemployment rates in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. And the challenge of preserving European living standards as the continent's population ages, and the world's centre of economic gravity shifts east, is immense.\par \par \uc2 Ever the optimist, Verhofstadt is already preparing for the fightback after this month's elections. "This month," he says, "you will see a kind of victory for the Eurosceptics. But that will hopefully lead to the emergence of a pro-European electorate and eventually to the new leap forward that we need."\par \par \uc2 Welcome to the dialectics of hope, EU-style. But as Europeans, or some of them, go to the polls this month, it will be a long time before anyone in Brussels can echo with confidence the famous injunction of Jean Monnet: "Continue, continue, there is no future for the people of Europe other than in union."\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 A young boy holds an EU flag while resting on his mother's shoulder in Warsaw on 1 May, 2004, the day Poland joined the Union.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 The British-dominated alliance of MEPs that \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  created in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  is fighting for survival, as polls show that it faces being wiped out in elections this month.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron, the UK prime minister, established the group five years ago when he withdrew his Conservative party MEPs from the parliament's biggest political group - the centre-right European People's Party - to assuage party members opposed to further EU integration.\par \par \uc2 That move has contributed to an erosion of British influence in Brussels, according to many analysts, diplomats and EU lobbyists - although London denies this.\par \par \uc2 Forecasts from Pollwatch2014 show the Cameron group - the European Conservatives and Reformists - falling from 59 to 39 members in the May 22-25 elections and securing seats in only six member states. That would be one short of the minimum required to form a group, under the parliament's rules.\par \par \uc2 The ECR is competing with two political groups on the eurosceptic right - the Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) group, led by the UK Independence party, and the hard-right European Alliance for Freedom (EAF), backed by France's Marine Le Pen - in a contest that will decide parliament posts and millions of euros in EU funding.\par \par \uc2 The squeeze is forcing the ECR and Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, to consider allying with controversial rightwing parties. In a move that could sour relations with \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2 , the German chancellor, Mr Cameron is also weighing pleas to unite with the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party.\par \par \uc2 Even if the ECR does survive, the Tories may lose pole position in a group that they founded.\par \par \uc2 Poland's Law & Justice (PiS) party, which veers from its British partners with its support for the free movement of migrants and greater EU spending, is predicted to return as the biggest ECR party, overtaking the Tories by one seat. \uc2 Martin Callanan\uc2 , the Tory leader of the group, also faces a stiff challenge to retain a seat in northeast England.\par \par \uc2 Mats Persson, head of the Open Europe think-tank, said: "Though no one's fault in particular, [the] Conservatives may be slapped by the double whammy of a weakened ECR group in the parliament, and a weakened Tory party within the ECR. As MEPs will have a decisive say over several items in Cameron's EU renegotiation package, this is worrying."\par \par \uc2 He added that the need to secure the cash and influential parliamentary positions garnered by solid political groups may force Mr Cameron and Mr Farage "to reach out to political parties to their right that wouldn't normally be their preferred bedfellows, to put it mildly."\par \par \uc2 The annihilation threat is already stirring discontent. Some senior PiS member are floating the idea of breaking with the ECR to form a separate group - a nightmare for the Tories in Brussels.\par \par \uc2 The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.\par \par \uc2 <>Zbigniew Girzynski, a senior PiS lawmaker, said the ECR concept had potentially "exhausted itself", noting: "Belonging to a political faction isn't something life-long. Political parties carry out analysis of the given situation and react flexibly."\par \par \uc2 The British Conservatives are confident that new recruits will join what insiders have dubbed "the minibus", potentially including Flemish nationalists and the eurosceptic Finns party. Some MEPs are pushing for the Tories to embrace the rightwing, anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  Danish People's Party.\par \par \uc2 Another politically explosive option is allying with the AfD, regardless of its impact on relations with Ms Merkel. Bernd Lucke, AfD co-founder, has said he is talking to the ECR's Czechs and Poles about joining but acknowledges British concerns.\par \par \uc2 Timo Soini, the leader of the Finns, is keeping an open mind on ECR attempts to poach him from Mr Farage's bloc. He told the Financial Times that he would "negotiate the group thing after the elections.\par \par \uc2 "No hands are tied," he added. "I have good personal relations to all parties and persons both in the EFD and ECR."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage has rejected joining forces with Ms Le Pen's National Front on grounds of its "anti-Semitism and general prejudice".\par \par \uc2 But Geert Wilders, whose Dutch Freedom party is part of the hard-right EAF, has expressed confidence that Mr Farage and Ms Le Pen will be able to "work together".\par \par \uc2 Losing group status would deal a heavy financial blow. Open Europe estimates that the EAF would receive up to \u8364\'20\'AC4m in annual funding, which would rise to \u8364\'20\'AC7m with Ukip aboard. If the ECR takes a "big tent" approach to the right wing and AfD, it could receive some \u8364\'20\'AC6m a year.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140511ea5b0025u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich38\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal570

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A UKIP activist who called for all \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to be sent home is set to fight a key Commons seat for Nigel Farages party.\par \par \uc2 The party is poised to name controversial Lincolnshire councillor Victoria Ayling as its parliamentary candidate for Great Grimsby, which is narrowly held by Labour.\par \par \uc2 The move comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed how former Tory Mrs Ayling had been caught on camera calling for all \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to be repatriated, saying: I just want to send the lot back.\par \par \uc2 Her former husband has also claimed that she was once a member of the far-Right National Front, but she has denied the allegation.\par \par \uc2 Last night, Labour said Mrs Aylings selection would completely undermine Mr Farages boast last week that ethnic minority voters would be flocking to support his party.\par \par \uc2 Labour MP Ronnie Campbell said: Moves like this make a mockery of Nigel Farage trying to appeal to the ethnic minorities.\par \par \uc2 UKIP people say one thing but do another. Its hypocrisy.\par \par \uc2 Last December, this paper exposed how Mrs Ayling, described by a party insider as a Farage filly for the way she was fast-tracked after defecting from the Tories, had made inflammatory comments on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  while still a Conservative. In a 20-minute video filmed in 2008, she talked about restricting the number of foreigners coming in to the country, before saying: I just want to send the lot back but I cant say that.\par \par \uc2 She added: We must basically repatriate those that shouldnt be here. At the time, Mrs Ayling, 54, claimed that her remarks had been taken out of context.\par \par \uc2 Now she is poised to be named as UKIPs candidate for the marginal Labour seat of Great Grimsby " which she fought at the 2010 election as a Tory. Four years ago, she came within 714 votes of a shock victory against Labour veteran Austin Mitchell, who is standing down next year. Mrs Ayling was unavailable for comment last night.\par \par \uc2 However, earlier this year, she spoke openly about her ambitions to become an MP and denied any suggestion of racism in her remarks on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 UKIP has been beset by a series of embarrassing claims by party members in recent weeks, including one who said comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a black country. But last week Mr Farage used a rally in London with black and Asian party candidates to deny claims his party harboured racism.\par \par \uc2 In a separate development yesterday, UKIP switched tactics by launching a poster campaign to win blue-collar votes from Labour ahead of next weeks European elections.\par \par \uc2 The anti-Brussels party sought to mimic Ed Milibands cost of living campaign by claiming EU membership put an extra \u163\'00\'A3400 on UK household food bills. The campaign, funded by Eurosceptic millionaire Paul Sykes, came amid UKIP claims that it would now squeeze the soft Labour vote in the same way it has attracted former Tory supporters.\par \par \uc2 A party spokesman said the decision to switch the attack on to Labour was taken by Mr Farage and key aides at a strategy meeting last week. The move was based on research showing that given the party had already eaten deep into the Tory vote, traditional Labour supporters represented the biggest, softest section of voters left to be squeezed in the final ten days of the European campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said: Despite these being European elections, Labour and Ed Miliband do not want to talk about Europe. They have nothing to say apart from the fact that they wont trust the people to decide if they wish to be governed from Westminster or from Brussels.\par \par \uc2 Document MOSM000020140510ea5b00025\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Clegg's blunt solution\b0\par\par\uc2 NICK FERRARI   \par \uc2 791 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Express\par \uc2 THEXSU\par \uc2 1; National\par 25\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) Copyright Express Newspapers 2014   \par \par \uc2 IT IS very easy to have a go at Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Indeed, last week the Labour party, bizarrely, decided to devote its entire party political broadcast to belittling him, seeking to portray him as a bullied, putupon wimp who is routinely ignored by Coalition Cabinet colleagues.\par \par \uc2 Never mind that top of most sane people's worry list is the economy, jobs, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , national security or the state of the health service, Labour lavished a considerable sum to send up Nick Clegg in a film that was humourless, pointless and left most people feeling they could not care less.\par \par \uc2 As someone in the media who probably knows Mr Clegg as well as anyone (his "Call Clegg" segment has been on my radio show virtually every week for the past 18 months) I can assure you he is too robust and steadfast for this to have fazed him for even a heartbeat.\par \par \uc2 However, what desperately does require more scrutiny is his avowed intent to block Conservative plans for a crackdown on knife crime. This was promised in \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's manifesto in 2010 but was another victim of the fact that the Tories managed to blast the ball over the bar in front of the empty goal of that general election and needed a coalition with the Lib Dems to get into power.\par \par \uc2 In truth, the authorities help Scotland start digging clues in McCann commentators and political chatterati have been deeply dismayed by how little the Coalition has fought and how well, in most areas, it has performed. Hence they seize on any bit of discord and treat it as if it were fisticuffs across the Cabinet table.\par \par \uc2 This bold stance by Clegg could be the one, however, that causes a good old-fashioned rumpus and possibly demonstrates that despite taking all the calls we have done together down the months, he might not always have been listening. Partly spurred on by the stabbing to death of a teacher in her classroom, the Conservatives want to introduce automatic jail terms for repeat knife offenders, a "two strikes and you're in" kind of policy but Clegg is adamantly against it.\par \par \uc2 He dismisses it as an attempt to introduce "headline-grabbing solutions" in the wake of the killing of Ann Maguire. He goes on to claim it could "turn the young offenders of today into the hardened criminals of tomorrow" and calls it "a backwards step that will undermine the Government's rehabilitation revolution".\par \par \uc2 This is high stakes stuff for Mr Clegg and if, as is being mooted, the Labour party opts to support the Conservatives, at a time when the Lib Dems' poll ratings are bouncing on the bottom and in one case they are being beaten even by the Green Party, Clegg's party risks being stranded on a political peninsula. Clegg is a shrewd strategist and is that rare politician who usually actually stands by his beliefs, however unpopular they might be. As the calls came in last week, he did not move an inch on his trenchant opposition, even if his rather convoluted argument "it could mean an electrician could be sent to prison for going to work with a penknife" seemed as big a stretch as you are ever likely to witness outside of a gymnast's workout. The likelihood of the \uc2 Crown Prosecution Service\uc2  seeking such a conviction could best be described as remote.\par \par \uc2 EXPERTS in the field support the move. Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said it was time for "a proper and objective look at youth sentencing... in controlling the use of knives." Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe agreed and pointed out it has worked extremely well in controlling the use of guns as everyone knows they will get a minimum of five years inside.\par \par \uc2 Sir Bernard added that there is every reason it would work equally well in combating the problem of knives.\par \par \uc2 If Clegg's opposition is a principled stance it is to be admired but in no way whatsoever does that detract from the fact that he could very well be incorrect and surely in an area as potentially dangerous and sometimes lethal as knife crime, it is worth heeding the advice of the police and the judiciary.\par \par \uc2 IF YOUR failure to act soon enough could be seen in any way whatsoever to have contributed to the bungled investigation into the disappearance of a little girl on holiday, wouldn't you want to put things right at the first opportunity? So, can anyone explain the ludicrous intransigence of the Portuguese authorities and their failure to help Scotland Yard detectives start digging at once for clues in the Madeleine McCann case? was and\par \par \uc2 Document THEXSU0020140511ea5b0003i\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Ukip turns its sights on Labour\b0\par\par\uc2 Marco Giannangeli   \par \uc2 352 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Express\par \uc2 THEXSU\par \uc2 1; National\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) Copyright Express Newspapers 2014   \par \par \uc2 UKIP will target Labour seats as its European election campaign changes tack, it emerged last night.\par \par \uc2 The move, agreed at a high-level strategy meeting last week, will see the party launch a head-on assault on Ed Miliband's "cost of living" message.\par \par \uc2 Insiders revealed the change of tactic was inspired by an interview between the Labour leader and BBC presenter \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A source said: "It occurred to party leader Nigel Farage that Mr Miliband did not understand the links between the crisis in living standards and our membership of the EU."\par \par \uc2 The campaign will see two posters unveiled tomorrow in London and Doncaster, a key target area for Ukip, highlighting the extra cost that EU membership brings to energy and food bills.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage said last night: "These two new posters bring home the point graphically in a way I believe will resonate within working-class communities.\par \par \uc2 "Food prices and energy prices are key components of the squeeze on living standards and in both cases the EU is right at the heart of the squeeze." Insiders confirmed Ukip's sights would be particularly trained on urban areas in the North-east, including South Shields and Sunderland, South Yorkshire and the South-west.\par \par \uc2 Deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: "Labour has lost five million traditional supporters since Tony Blair's New Labour experiment, which has seen the party hijacked by a Liberal Metropolitan middle-class agenda and they have been left disowned. Many actually have Conservative social values. These are the people affected most by mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  because these are the people whose communities have been turned upside down.\par \par \uc2 Our policies resonate with them. They are the most likely to be affected by crime and this is where our zerotolerance approach, and our objection to the Human Rights Act, go down so well. At the moment we have education by wealth and not ability, because all social mobility has stagnated.\par \par \uc2 "The Common Agricultural Policy means every working-class family is paying \u163\'00\'A3400 a year extra for food."\par \par \uc2 'EU increases cost of living'\par \par \uc2 Document THEXSU0020140511ea5b0003h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A new poster campaign aims to woo voters by lifting Labour's line on the 'cost of living crisis' and blaming Brussels for it\par \par \uc2 NIGEL FARAGE will hijack Ed Miliband's cost-of-living campaign this week in an attempt to win over the "soft underbelly" of Labour support from working-class voters.\par \par \uc2 The UKIP leader will release adverts arguing that it is Britain's membership of the EU that has pushed up the price of food and fuel.\par \par \uc2 The raid for blue-collar votes comes amid growing fears from Labour MPs that their leader is failing to give them the tools to fight UKIP on the doorstep.\par \par \uc2 Senior backbenchers last night warned Miliband that Labour's failure to offer policies to reduce \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  had bolstered UKIP support in its northern England heartlands ahead of local and European elections on May 22. MPs say that Miliband's staff assured them at a subcommittee meeting of the parliamentary Labour party six weeks ago that they would have a new and distinctive policy on migration. One backbencher who was present said: "We are all asking where this great promised policy disappeared to. There has been nothing \u8212\'20\'14 nothing."\par \par \uc2 Today Farage will unveil two campaign posters on the cost of living. The first tells voters to "Use your loaf" and claims food bills could be \u163\'00\'A3400 a year cheaper in every UK household. In a reference to Miliband's pledge to freeze fuel bills, the second, of a lightbulb, argues that "Without the EU, every UK fuel bill would be \u163\'00\'A3112 cheaper."\par \par \uc2 Farage said he believed the posters would "resonate with working-class voters".\par \par \uc2 "I agree with Mr Miliband that there is a cost-of-living crisis going on. But I intend to expose the fact that much of it is down to Labour's own policies when it was last in government and in particular its acquiescence to diktats coming out of Brussels," he said. "Food prices and energy prices are two key components of the squeeze on living standards. And in both cases the EU is right at the heart of the squeeze."\par \par \uc2 Labour figures point out that the party has announced a series of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policies. These include measures to prevent employment agencies recruiting only from abroad. But Labour MPs said this was not as eye-catching as Miliband's pledge to freeze fuel prices and restrict rent rises. One said: "It doesn't do much at all to control the numbers coming here."\par \par \uc2 At a meeting last month Labour MPs from northwest England challenged Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary. Lindsay Hoyle, the MP for Chorley, proposed using wounded soldiers no longer capable of fighting to help the UK Border Force screen lorries and check passports.\par \par \uc2 Another asked Cooper what she thought of banning new British citizens from holding dual nationality to cement their loyalty to the UK.\par \par \uc2 An MP present said: "It was disappointing how little Yvette was able to say. The leadership don't have anything on the subject and people are constantly raising it when we go out on the doorstep." Frank Field, the MP for Birkenhead, was not present at the meeting but said this weekend that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was his party's "Achilles heel". He added: "It is a toxic issue on the doorstep. They [the leadership] need to get it. It is now too late for the European election. We have to have something for the general election."\par \par \uc2 Miliband aides say Labour has learnt its lessons on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 : "We do recognise that people feel their voice was not being listened to and their concerns about the pace of change in their communities was a legitimate subject."\par \par \uc2 However, attempts to adopt a tougher stance on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  could endanger party funding. Next month, Labour's biggest donor, Len McCluskey's \uc2 Unite union\uc2 , will discuss a motion to cut its funding by 10% if the leadership adopts any policy of "scapegoating migrants".\par \par \uc2 Miliband will instead retreat to home turf this week, putting the \uc2 NHS\uc2  "front and centre" of his campaign with a speech tomorrow and an election broadcast on Tuesday featuring footage of the Labour leader working in a hospital. His election coordinator, \uc2 Douglas Alexander\uc2 , has resisted calls to pander to Farage-leaning voters. "We won't win by becoming a better UKIP," he said. "We will win by becoming a better Labour party."\par \par \uc2 MPs say frustrations about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy are a bellwether for concern about Miliband's leadership style. His claim last week that he had "more intellectual self-confidence" than \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  was recognised by many as fair, but it made some cringe.\par \par \uc2 In a speech at Labour's headquarters last week Miliband told staff they were "in the fight of our lives" to win the general election. He pledged that Labour would provide the "boldest, most radical offer laid before the British people for a generation".\par \par \uc2 Polls show that his big ideas are his most popular. A You-Gov survey for The Sunday Times found that 69% backed his energy price freeze, 63% capping rent rises, 60% Labour's flirtation with renationalising the railways and 54% supported higher council tax for properties left empty.\par \par \uc2 But YouGov's Anthony Wells said: "Popular policies are not increasing perceptions of Ed Miliband himself \u8212\'20\'14 56% still think he hasn't made it clear what he stands for, 48% see him as weak leader. Only 23% think he would be up to the job of prime minister."\par \par \uc2 Allies say he should be applauded for uniting Labour and putting it "in the game" 12 months before the election.\par \par \uc2 One said: "In 2010 the assumption was that Labour would implode, that we were somehow irrelevant and we would be out of power for a long time. We're recovering from our second-worst defeat since the introduction of universal suffrage. The fact that we are competitive is an extraordinary achievement."\par \par \uc2 Miliband's party is expected to gain 500 council seats but he could be the first opposition leader not to top the poll in the Euro elections since Neil Kinnock in 1984.\par \par \uc2 MPs say Miliband's reluctance to take on UKIP and his preference for theorising about creating a new kind of capitalism does not connect with the blue-collar workers who backed Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair. "The trouble with Ed is that he is so aloof he does not have a clue what people are concerned about," one MP said.

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 At least 30,000 Romanians and Bulgarians have come to Britain to work in the last year, as border controls were lifted to comply with EU law, figures are set to show this week\par \par \uc2 Tens of thousands of eastern European migrants have moved to Britain for work in the last year at a time when border controls were being relaxed, official figures are forecast to show this week.\par \par \uc2 In an exclusive analysis prepared for The Telegraph, economists from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Oxford University}}}\uc2  predict that the figures will show at least 30,000 more Romanians and Bulgarians were working in the UK in the first three months of this year than during the same period in 2013.\par \par \uc2 The increase - of more than 25 per cent - is likely to take the total number of migrants now living in Britain from these two countries alone to 200,000, when their unemployed family members are taken into account.\par \par \uc2 The figures follows the lifting of all restrictions on new migrants coming to Britain from Romania and Bulgaria, the \uc2 European Union\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s poorest member states, on January 1.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, official employment statistics will provide the first indication of the impact that lifting the partial ban has had on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to Britain.\par \par \uc2 In the weeks before the border controls were removed, Conservative MPs called for restrictions on the two countries to be extended but ministers refused, arguing it would have broken European laws.\par \par \uc2 The figures come at a highly-charged time, with less than two weeks until \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  elections are held across Britain. David Cameron is under pressure to take a tougher approach to European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  in order to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10776305/European-elections-Conservatives-face-poll-humiliation-as-one-in-three-Tory-voters-defect-to-Ukip.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 win back voters from the UK Independence Party}}}\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Bulgarians and Romanians have been able to travel to Britain without a visa since they joined the EU in 2007. However, temporary restrictions were placed on employment, with work permits and quotas for low-skilled jobs in farming and food processing.\par \par \uc2 This meant most Romanians and Bulgarians took seasonal work such as fruit picking unless they were self-employed.\par \par \uc2 All restrictions ended on January 1 this year and Bulgarians and Romanians are now entitled to claim the same benefits and \uc2 NHS\uc2  care as other EU citizens.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  will publish an estimate of the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK between January and March this year, the first three months after the restrictions were lifted.\par \par \uc2 Analysts from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Oxford’s Migration Observatory }}}\uc2  unit said the number was almost certain to be higher as it had risen even while controls were in place.\par \par \uc2 In the first quarter of 2007, there were 29,000 Romanian and Bulgarian workers over the age of 16 living in Britain. By the same January-to-March period last year, the figure had almost quadrupled to 112,000.\par \par \uc2 Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva, an economist and senior researcher at the Migration Observatory, said he expected to see \u8220\'20\'1Ca big increase\u8221\'20\'1D when the official results are released.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is almost certain that we are going to see an increase in that number from the first quarter in 2013 to the first quarter in 2014,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CWe would expect at least 30,000 more. It is difficult to predict, but that would be the minimum you would expect.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 By December 2013, there were 144,000 Romanian and Bulgarian workers in the UK.\par \par \uc2 While there were restrictions on workers taking jobs with large employers, there was no limit on migrants registering as \u8220\'20\'1Cself-employed\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Dr Vargas-Silva said: \u8220\'20\'1CIt is possible to argue that many of the people who wanted to come to the UK are already here because they are working as self-employed.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COr it may be the case that many of them are looking for jobs with big companies so they are coming to the UK now.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Migration Watch UK\uc2 , another think-tank specialising in \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  data, predicted that a total of about 50,000 more migrants from the two countries would arrive every year for the next five years.\par \par \uc2 Alp Mehmet, vice chairman of Migration Watch UK, and a former ambassador to Iceland, said there would be \u8220\'20\'1Cadditional pressures\u8221\'20\'1D on schools, housing and the \uc2 NHS\uc2  from \u8220\'20\'1Can influx of people of this order\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe addition to the population has quite a significant impact on all of us, not least at a time of limited resources,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Philip Hollobone, the Conservative MP for Kettering, said next week\u8217\'20\'19s \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  figures would be \u8220\'20\'1Cfurther confirmation that we have no control whatsoever over EU migration\u8221\'20\'1D and called for Britain to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1C\b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is the number one issue on the doorstep,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CUnless we tackle the issue of our EU membership we are not going to control levels of EU migration.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140511ea5b0012y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Actor fears break-up of the UK as he heaps praise on 'unique' Edinburgh festival, writes Jason Allardyce\par \par \uc2 SCOTTISH independence might provide "a temporary adrenaline rush" but breaking up the UK would be "a tragic diminution of our lives", Simon Callow has warned.\par \par \uc2 The award-winning actor and director, who starred in Four Weddings and a Funeral, is the latest prominent English artist to urge Scots to stay in the Union, following interventions by David Bowie and Eddie Izzard, among others.\par \par \uc2 Callow spent the early years of his career in Scotland and said the nation had been "so profoundly central to British history".\par \par \uc2 The 64-year-old, who returns to the Edinburgh Fringe in July with a production based on the satirical Roman poet Juvenal, said his period in Scotland \u8212\'20\'14 working in Edinburgh with the Young Lyceum and the Traverse \u8212\'20\'14 was "a golden time" as he discovered himself as an actor while discovering a country previously unknown to him.\par \par \uc2 "It was the beginning of my love affair with Scotland and the Scots, though my childhood had been filled with stories of Rob Roy all weirdly bound up with Burns Nichts and Hogmanays celebrated with ancient cousins from Aberdeen.\par \par \uc2 "What I thought as we bounced around the Highlands with our production of The Fantasticks was how gloriously diverse Britain was. I already knew Northern Ireland, which had started the train of thought, but Scotland was so profoundly central to British history \u8212\'20\'14 and how inconceivable British life would be without the Scottish contribution! Coming to know Edinburgh confirmed my sense of the real meaning of the phrase 'the United Kingdoms', because the great city was so clearly the capital of the kingdom in the north, a place of massive dignity and splendour, absolutely itself but absolutely part of my sense of nationhood.\par \par \uc2 "To me it would be a tragic diminution of our lives for Scotland to sever the connection; I would feel myself diminished, a lesser person, and I know that my many many Scottish friends will feel the same, whatever the temporary adrenaline rush of independence."\par \par \uc2 Callow's production Juvenalia reprises a success from early in his career. Being performed at Assembly, it is based on the writer Juvenal, who was born about AD55 and wrote 16 satires that attacked the decadence of Rome in its heyday. His insights into moral decline are said to be as relevant now as then.\par \par \uc2 "I was reminded how shockingly modern the old bugger is \u8212\'20\'14 an embittered member of the dispossessed middle-class raging against governments, \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , queers, women in great comic arias," said Callow.\par \par \uc2 "I originally did Juvenalia in 1976 \u8212\'20\'14 my first one-man show \u8212\'20\'14 and looking at it again, I was appalled to think how much more recognisable [he is] today than he was then. He positively demanded a platform. I'm only surprised he didn't ask for a televised debate with Nick Clegg." Callow's first appearance as an actor was in Edinburgh and he regards the city as the most perfect site for a festival, describing it as "an incomparably dramatic and uniquely beautiful location, out-Salzburging Salzburg, its main rival" with a "uniquely exciting and stimulating atmosphere in which to do a show".\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140511ea5b000xv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw157\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2355\pichgoal600

In an interview with the Sunday Herald, Farage added that he was not an \u8220\'20\'1Cexpert\u8221\'20\'1D on matters north of the Border, but insisted he had \u8220\'20\'1Cleisured\u8221\'20\'1D in Scotland.\par \par \uc2 The party, which is opposed to the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , is being tipped for a historic victory in this month\u8217\'20\'19s Brussels parliament elections. The party has so far had no success in Scotland at any level, but candidate David Coburn is believed to have a chance of getting elected by riding on the Farage bandwagon \u8211\'20\'13 if Ukip polls 12% north of the Border, Coburn could become the party\u8217\'20\'19s first elected representative in Scotland.\par \par \uc2 However, the right-wing group has been torn apart in recent months by backbiting and factionalism. The internal process for selecting a European candidate was tarnished when six of the nine hopefuls quit amid allegations of unfairness. Farage removed Lord Monckton as Scottish party leader by email, party chairman Mike Scott Hayward quit in protest, and former chairman Paul Henke was suspended for 100 years.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to this newspaper at Edinburgh\u8217\'20\'19s Corn Exchange on Friday, where hundreds of protesters were outside chanting anti-racism slogans, Farage and Coburn spoke of the divisions in the party and their hopes for the future.\par \par \uc2 On Monckton\u8217\'20\'19s sacking, the Ukip leader said: \u8220\'20\'1CI didn\u8217\'20\'19t actually fire him. Our party chairman did. It\u8217\'20\'19s a team game, politics, and however big and important individuals are, or think they are, you\u8217\'20\'19ve got to work together as a team.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Asked about Henke\u8217\'20\'19s 100-year suspension, which was later lifted, he said \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t do discipline\u8221\'20\'1D and joked that he would have imposed a \u8220\'20\'1Ctougher\u8221\'20\'1D penalty had he been responsible for the decision.\par \par \uc2 Farage\u8217\'20\'19s last trip to Edinburgh ended with him being bundled out of a pub in a police van after left-wing protesters interrupted his press conference.\par \par \uc2 Asked about the perception that he knows little about Scotland, Farage said: \u8220\'20\'1CI personally don\u8217\'20\'19t know much about Herefordshire, but we are standing [Ukip candidates] in Herefordshire.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Asked if he knew the name of the Scotland football manager, he said: \u8220\'20\'1CNo, I don\u8217\'20\'19t, but I\u8217\'20\'19ve done business in Scotland, I\u8217\'20\'19ve leisured in Scotland. But I\u8217\'20\'19m not an expert on Scotland.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Coburn also struggled: \u8220\'20\'1CIt used to be \uc2 Alex Ferguson\uc2 , didn\u8217\'20\'19t it? I\u8217\'20\'19m not a football fan, I\u8217\'20\'19m a rugby fan.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 So could he name the captain of Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s rugby team? \u8220\'20\'1CCurrently, I\u8217\'20\'19m not sure who the captain is.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Farage\u8217\'20\'19s public persona is of an eccentric, plain-speaking figure who stands outside the political class. However, in his role as an MEP, he employs his wife, a practice disliked by many members of the public. Will he continue to employ his spouse if he is re-elected this month?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe rules won\u8217\'20\'19t allow me to go on doing that. So quite how that works \u8230\'20\'26 she\u8217\'20\'19ll have to do it unpaid, won\u8217\'20\'19t she,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. Wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t that be illegal? \u8220\'20\'1CProbably,\u8221\'20\'1D he joked.\par \par \uc2 Farage said he admired \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2 , but could not understand the SNP\u8217\'20\'19s pro-Europe stance. He said of the similarities between the two party leaders: \u8220\'20\'1CI suppose we\u8217\'20\'19ve led parties that are anti-establishment, insurgent parties.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Farage predicted a No vote in September\u8217\'20\'19s referendum, but criticised the official pro-Union campaign, saying: \u8220\'20\'1CThe Better Together campaign don\u8217\'20\'19t appear to have made much impact.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 SNP MSP James Dornan said: \u8220\'20\'1CThis is an embarrassing own goal for Ukip which sums up just how little they know about Scotland. Along with their unpleasant views, it is why they will be relegated to the sidelines at the European elections in Scotland.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document SUNDHE0020140511ea5b0001h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw157\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2355\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NWS\par \b \uc2 Railing against political Faragisms\b0\par\par\uc2 Comment  By Iain Macwhirter   \par \uc2 1,236 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Herald\par \uc2 SUNDHE\par \uc2 1\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014, Herald & Times Group   \par \par \uc2 Are the Scottish chattering classes complacent about the threat posed by Ukip and Nigel Farage, who received a hostile welcome from radical independence demonstrators in Edinburgh on Friday night? Most people believe that Ukip is a uniquely English political phenomenon that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t travel well. We don\u8217\'20\'19t hate \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  up here and we don\u8217\'20\'19t want to leave Europe, axe maternity rights for women or cut off people\u8217\'20\'19s benefits. Anyway, didn\u8217\'20\'19t Ukip want to scrap the Scottish Parliament?\par \par \uc2 Well, yes they did \u8211\'20\'13 at least until last year. Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s policies are hard to pin down because their manifesto is a work in progress and their leader seems to chop and change them at will. But then again, there are still a lot of people in Scotland who think the Parliament is a waste of money.\par \par \uc2 Many voters have never forgiven Holyrood for the Parliament building fiasco, the expenses scandals and the general sense that the Scottish Parliament is a playground for liberal pressure groups wanting Clare\u8217\'20\'19s laws, fox hunting bans, and social workers replacing parents.\par \par \uc2 Ukip have never kept a deposit in any election here, and have a very small membership base. Most Scots would not think of voting for them in any election that counts. But that is precisely the problem with the European elections: they don\u8217\'20\'19t count. Turnouts in past polls have been even lower than local authority elections \u8211\'20\'13 barely 30% of Scottish voters cast their ballot in the 2009 European elections. In such apathetic elections, small parties like Ukip can come from nowhere and get a significant percentage result on very few actual votes.\par \par \uc2 It is not inconceivable that Ukip could approach their target of 10%, though I don\u8217\'20\'19t think they will secure a seat. Nevertheless, any significant vote for Ukip in Scotland will be magnified by the UK press, who will say that this country isn\u8217\'20\'19t so different after all, and that social democratic Scotland is a myth.\par \par \uc2 Scratch the surface of many Scottish voters and you will find people who don\u8217\'20\'19t like Europe, for much the same reasons they don\u8217\'20\'19t like Westminster: it\u8217\'20\'19s remote from their lives, manufactures bureaucratic regulations and is a gravy train for corrupt politicians. Relatively few will actually vote for Ukip, but the anti-politics trend is one thing that really does unite Scotland and England. There is a hostility verging on loathing for establishment politicians among a significant minority of votes \u8211\'20\'13 and in Scotland the Scottish National Party is also an establishment party.\par \par \uc2 Then there\u8217\'20\'19s the man thing. It lurks in the corners of the internet and dare not speak its name, but a lot of young to middle-aged men feel they are living in a society that no longer wants them. They fail at school, find that women are taking over in the workplace, see their heterosexual values and prejudices disparaged by a media which they see as promoting gay men and women\u8217\'20\'19s issues. They don\u8217\'20\'19t feel they have any authority over their children any more and no longer feel like they are respected as breadwinners. They also think that people on benefits are living a comfortable life on their hard-working taxes.\par \par \uc2 This complex set of anti-\u173\'00\'ADestablishment reflexes, rather than Britain\u8217\'20\'19s relationship to Europe, is what really motivates Ukip voters. Nigel Farage, with his bar room bonhomie, doesn\u8217\'20\'19t need to spell it out. They know from his body language that he loathes the politically correct media establishment, the nanny state telling people not to drink or smoke or slap their children. He doesn\u8217\'20\'19t allow the media to paint him as a racist homophobe because he doesn\u8217\'20\'19t actually say anything racist or homophobic. But everyone knows where he stands.\par \par \uc2 It has often been said that Ukip is the BNP with a human face, and in a way Farage has completed the cross-over attempted by Nick Griffin, the bankrupt former leader of the British National Party. Farage has made anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  politics respectable \u8211\'20\'13 indeed, not only respectable but arguably also the dominant issue in UK politics right now. All the parties are playing his tune. Labour politicians scarcely open their mouths without apologising about how they \u8220\'20\'1Cgot it wrong\u8221\'20\'1D over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and ignored the justifiable anxieties of \u8220\'20\'1Cordinary\u8221\'20\'1D Labour voters.\par \par \uc2 The BBC can\u8217\'20\'19t get enough of Nigel. The role of the state broadcaster in promoting the far right warrants at least a footnote in the history. Farage has been accorded almost unlimited access to the airwaves. He is hardly ever off programmes like Question Time. His party has no MPs or MSPs, yet he got two hour-long televised debates with Nick Clegg. Why has the BBC fallen in love with a politician who hates everything it stands for? Well, it\u8217\'20\'19s his audience pulling power which they love, rather than his politics. He is box office. Farage is the Tony Blair of the Right and producers just can\u8217\'20\'19t get enough of him.\par \par \uc2 And yes \u8211\'20\'13 it\u8217\'20\'19s also a very BBC way of getting one over the Tories. The Conservatives have been shattered by Farage. Ukip is poised to achieve what no-one thought was possible a couple of years ago: overall victory in the European elections, largely on the basis of stolen Tory votes.\par \par \uc2 After initially calling him a fruitcake and then trying to ignore him, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  has now had to agree to a televised debate with Farage. This damages the Conservatives in Scotland because the PM has refused to debate independence with Alex Salmond, even though the First Minister represents the governing party of Scotland and has a sizeable bloc of MPs in Westminster. It is humiliating for the Prime Minister to have to bend to the will of this outsider \u8211\'20\'13 and dangerous, because Cameron is liable to be pretty comprehensively defeated, on Farage\u8217\'20\'19s recent form.\par \par \uc2 Ukip has already forced UK politics to lurch to the right. We have had increasingly restrictive \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  laws making life difficult for students and others seeking visas. We have seen the demonisation of welfare recipients as \u8220\'20\'1Cskivers\u8221\'20\'1D by Cabinet ministers and the introduction of the benefits cap, which Labour supported last month. An in/out referendum on Europe seems increasingly likely now, as even Ed Miliband has conceded the possibility of holding one if Brussels seeks to take any more powers from Westminster. None of these policies are endorsed by Scotland\u8217\'20\'19s political parties. Ukip is driving a wedge between Scotland and England as well as between the UK and Europe.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the paradox is that an increased Ukip vote might actually benefit the Yes campaign. It will certainly concentrate the minds of Scots. Many will be highly motivated to vote in the referendum, if only to affirm their opposition to Farage and his policies. Ukip turns the argument about Europe on its head because if it does well on May 22, the prospects for a \u8220\'20\'1CBrexit\u8221\'20\'1D \u8211\'20\'13 a British exit from Europe \u8211\'20\'13 will be greatly increased, and if Scotland stays in the UK we will be out too.\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage says that Scots are being sold a phoney independence by the SNP and that voting Yes will leave turn Scotland into a province of Europe.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 More new and used car reviews on driving.co.uk\par \par \uc2 Halfway up the M1 on a blowy, bright spring day \u8212\'20\'14 the sort of spring day when you can race the clouds north \u8212\'20\'14 we stopped for breakfast. The photographer Tom Craig and I have done this trip to Scotland so often that we can tell the difference between motorway service stations.\par \par \uc2 Tom parked the Audi A8. He's a bit obsessive-compulsive about parking. Actually, he's up the tartan end of the spectrum about it. There are places that are OK and there are ones that definitely aren't OK and no one but he can tell the difference. The car has to be square to the white line and pointing towards Mecca. Or the sun. Or something. And never beside a caravan because caravans are bad karma.\par \par \uc2 So we're inside, looking out over the remains of a full English, and I am staring into the car park and I say, "Someone's nicked the motor."\par \par \uc2 And Tom replies, "They can't." And I say, "It's gone."\par \par \uc2 Tom says, "It can't have gone. I locked it twice. It locked itself in that smart, Iknow-you're-leaving-me sort of way, and then I locked it again because I am careful like that. And it's got all the cameras in it and your teddy bear in the boot."\par \par \uc2 I say, "It's not there." We look at the half-empty car park.\par \par \uc2 "Is that it?" says Tom. No, that's beside a caravan. In the end we have to go out and call for it like a lost dog with the electric sextoy thing they give you instead of a key now, and it blinks and wiggles its boot. It's right in front of us. That's the first thing you should know about the Audi: it's utterly forgettable to look at. It's a stealth car. It's what you'd want if you were a proper spy. James Bond might go for the Aston Martin but George Smiley would have the Audi.\par \par \uc2 If your mates were setting you up with this Audi as a blind date and you said, "What's she like?", they'd say, "She's clever." And you'd say, "Oh no \u8212\'20\'14 you mean she's a munter!" Blokes say cars are clever when they look like the back end of a fat girl.\par \par \uc2 "No, no," they'd say. "She's comfortable and nice-looking. Not page 3, not all curves and throbbing exhaust, but elegant. She's classy."\par \par \uc2 But you know you'd wake up next to the Audi and you'd forget its name.\par \par \uc2 "Are you Mercedes? Are you \uc2 BMW\uc2 ? I'm terrible with names."\par \par \uc2 But the Audi wouldn't mind; it would just reply in a silky voice, "You are 30 miles from a petrol station. There are two pizzerias within four minutes. My temperature is a comfortable 22 degrees and I am not pregnant."\par \par \uc2 The Audi looks exactly like all its competitors, all the other top-of-therange executive saloons. They are chief executives' desks. And for those of you who don't have a chief executive's desk, they look like all the cars that are double-parked outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair during London fashion week.\par \par \uc2 It's what Americans call a "town car".\par \par \uc2 An expensive taxi. If you had one of these in modest Copenhagen, your Danish friends would say, "How much to the airport?" and laugh. In Scandinavia executive limos are driven only by firstgeneration \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  as a job. You wouldn't order one if you were getting married in church but you probably would if it were a register office.\par \par \uc2 To some men all this is a plus. And it is only men who are going to want this car. Men who like anonymous things, who think spending a considerable amount of money on something rather plain is a sign of square-jawed self-confidence. Men who don't need Qatari princes' status symbols or teenage Silicon Valley billionaires' dream rides. This is the car for men who like to say, "I don't want my possessions to say, 'I'm going places'; I want them to say, 'I've arrived.' " And when you sit in the Audi and start driving, you realise what they mean. Well, obviously you haven't arrived, or you wouldn't be driving. But it's not just smooth and quick and solid and confident \u8212\'20\'14 all those adjectives that men with greying temples and muscular frowns like to apply to everything in their lives. It whispers to you: "If you were a car, I'm the car you'd like to be."\par \par \uc2 On the motorway it eats the tarmac like a cardinal sipping espressos: quickly, neatly and without ostentatious displays of pleasure. What's interesting is the reactions of other cars. They treat the Audi with respect but not fear. They let you past without your having to flash but they don't swerve across two lanes because you might be a drug dealer, a drug user or a member of a boyband.\par \par \uc2 You've never seen an Audi A8 driven badly. I don't think it's possible \u8212\'20\'14 this one takes hold of the steering wheel if you start being erratic. You won't find footage on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  of kids doughnutting it in downtown Dubai. You've never seen an Audi sitting awkwardly on the verge, having rear-ended a Volvo full of an Indian wedding party just outside Wolverhampton. It just doesn't happen.\par \par \uc2 Our Audi was a diesel, and I'll pass on this little fact about diesel Audis. Fill up the tank on your wedding anniversary and when it flashes up empty it will be your anniversary again. It's a useful way to remember significant dates. We drove all the way from London to Edinburgh and halfway back without bothering a fuel pump.\par \par \uc2 The car has all the illuminating information things that men who like Audis like. The dashboard tells you masses of statistics and useful nerdy facts. There is the option of a head-up display that will project the map on to the windscreen so that you can imagine you're off to bomb Coventry again.\par \par \uc2 It has an incredibly complicated sat nav system that can show you where you're going from three angles, but if you push the wrong knob it will turn the whole interior into a mellow, late-night Michael Bubl\u233\'00\'E9 club with low-level lighting and lumbar support. But we got to Motherwell before I found the cupholders.\par \par \uc2 The Audi does have one amazing, inexplicable trick up its dashboard. It obviously has cameras front and rear to stop you crashing. But when you reverse, the car shows you a moving image of your vehicle in real time from above. Also the road you're on, the cars parked beside you, the street furniture and the road markings. How can it do that? There isn't a camera hovering above you at all times. I know \u8212\'20\'14 I looked.\par \par \uc2 It's an almost pointless but immeasurably impressive bit of stuff. Just the sort of kit that makes the sort of man who is sort of thinking about a new saloon sign on the dotted line. The one thing it doesn't come with is the one thing it yearns for. A Kosovan driver in a tight suit who never sleeps.\par \par \uc2 Audi A8 3.0 TDI quattro SE Executive PRICE \u163\'00\'A361,405 ENGINE 2967cc, V6 POWER 254bhp @4000rpm TORQUE 427 lb ft @1750rpm TRANSMISSION 8-speed automatic PERFORMANCE 0-62mph: 5.9sec / Top speed: 155mph FUEL /CO2 47.9mpg (combined) / 155g/km VEHICLE TAX BAND G (\u163\'00\'A3180 for first year) RELEASE DATE On sale now THE GILLOMETER Adrian's verdict \{\{\{(( For men who like their possessions to say, 'I've arrived'\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140511ea5b000hk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 Jack clocks on again \u8212\'20\'14 and isn't half bad\b0\par\par\uc2 1,375 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 2; National\par 14,15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 You would have thought Hollywood's national security agencies would have learnt lessons since Jack Bauer was first compelled to save the world singlehandedly in 24 hours, not counting commercial breaks. Lessons such as: "Jack's right, there is an assassination plot aimed at the president. Let's put some people on that." Or: "Someone please give Kiefer a Fisherman's Friend before his next scene, he clearly has tonsillitis." But no, they've stuck to the biggest, most important lesson in television: if it ain't broke, keep recommissioning it. So here we are at the outset of 24: Live Another Day, aka season nine, with another president under threat and only one man on the planet capable of saving him.\par \par \uc2 Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.\par \par \uc2 While the real-time format ain't broke, it's certainly not quite as sprightly as it was in 2001. Back then, it didn't matter that the plot was ridiculous, or that Jack hadn't slept, urinated or eaten for 24 hours straight. He was, after all, in his mid-thirties, peak years for physical endurance. Now he's approaching 50, and the plausibility, if not the novelty, of a man with David Blaine's bladder control has long since worn off.\par \par \uc2 There are some improvements since the last, dampest squib of a season. Jack is now in London, and even though 24's version of London is half beefeater, half Brixton Laden, the relocation lends a shadier, less teeth-whitened atmosphere. The writers' room has gone for a bit of an update on terrorism clich\u233\'00\'E9s, too. Episode one has the president grappling, Play School-ishly, with the ethics of drone warfare; later, we'll have a bit of \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  hackery to keep things "contemporary".\par \par \uc2 Much more significant is that 24 is now, technically, 12. Everything still happens in real time, but with gaps when the narrative/budget requires them. We won't have to spend a whole episode watching Jack read an in-flight magazine when he pops over to Berlin. We can also assume he takes his toilet breaks in the unfilmed half of the day, which is a relief. It is still unfortunate that every counterterrorism headquarters in 24 looks like the Moshi Monsters office having a Dragons' Den party. And that the supporting cast continues to be poor. This is the UKIP of TV shows, a star vehicle for Sutherland, who is surrounded by a bunch of swivel-eyed loons you don't care about at all. The presidents have been rubbish \u8212\'20\'14 you'd assassinate every one on acting ability alone \u8212\'20\'14 and so have the sidekicks. Even if Chloe O'Brian is the only person to grasp that Jack is always, always right, she is so squinty, beaky and irritating, you can understand why the rest of the Counter Terrorism Unit never listen to her.\par \par \uc2 Still, I'll sit through the whole thing with a bowl of popcorn, groaning at the transparency of the cliffhangers and pre-empting their beeps with my own beeps. Stephen Fry makes his 24 debut as the prime minister, and he's not a swivel-eyed loon at all.\par \par \uc2 The deification of Gary Barlow came another step closer with the hour-long documentary When Corden Met Barlow. As anyone who endured Michael McIntyre's chat show will know, watching a celebrity interview another celebrity can be like eavesdropping on a first date in a gay sauna. James Corden, a Take That fanatic, didn't hold back on his love for Barlow in this cuddlier version of The Trip. Yet in between all the ego-massaging and rolling about in Range Rovers, there were glimpses of a real person, a star with his guard down, with no PR people hovering in the wings. In a meticulously manufactured world, here was truth, or the appearance of truth, a study in the fickleness of fame and the hard work, rather than good luck, that sustains it. I might even buy his new album, damn it.\par \par \uc2 It's obviously harder to kill off a zombie show than it is to kill a zombie. In the Flesh, BBC3's right-on, Bafta-winning drama, should have been buried for good after series one. It was a nice, original premise \u8212\'20\'14 can a small town in Lancashire adjust to life after an influx of the undead, particularly when the undead have feelings too? Served up with coming-of-age angst and a spot of supermarket zombie massacring, it was a watchable approach to an exhausted genre.\par \par \uc2 Now, like Jack Bauer foiling yet another dastardly plan, it's going over the same ground again. At the opening of series two, an extremist MP, Maxine Martin, wants to get tough on Partially Deceased Syndrome sufferers. If it wasn't for the scene where she kills one of them with a power tool, we could have been watching News 24's coverage of the European elections. \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2 . Intolerance. The easy slide into pitchfork illiberalism. It's Metaphor for Dummies. Which we got the first time around. Then there's the pace. Slow. Very slow. It's Day of the Triffids with deceased teenagers instead of triffids, but in a bad way.\par \par \uc2 Thank goodness we had a comedian preparing for his own impending death to cheer us up. Billy Connolly's Big Send Off began with the Big Yin telling us it had been a funny week. "On the Monday I got hearing aids," he told us. "On the Tuesday I got pills for heartburn, and on the Wednesday I got news that I had prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease."\par \par \uc2 Part one of a two-part journey focused on the predictably ridiculous funeral industry in America. He visited a pet cemetery ("The smaller the dog, the bigger the gravestone") and a Jewish cemetery ("How weird to have speed bumps in a cemetery"), he contemplated a self-composting eco death suit and he ended up at the frequently televised drive-thru funeral parlour.\par \par \uc2 It was like all Connolly's other great journeys \u8212\'20\'14 trademark warmth, trademark nonjudgmental judgmentalism \u8212\'20\'14 but with the extra clarity and poignancy brought by a ticking clock. On seeing the ashes of three anonymous San Franciscans being salt-and-peppered into the Pacific, Connolly wondered if they had just come into this life and left again with nobody noticing. "Make the most of it while you're here, folks," he concluded, blinking back a tear. It was one of several powerful moments.\par \par \uc2 The journey ended in a mosque, where it emerged that Islam has the most practical, least hypocritical approach to burial. While the Christians of California bankrupt themselves on fancy caskets, and their Jewish neighbours trade astronomical numbers in real estate for their dead, a Muslim funeral, rich or poor, is an exercise in affordable simplicity. And that's the first bit of positive television I've seen on Islam in a long time.\par \par \uc2 Dr Richard Clay, a \uc2 Birmingham University\uc2  art historian, made his television debut in The French Revolution \u8212\'20\'14 Tearing Up History. He is a strange egg. He has a long fringe and an arrhythmic gait, like a spider trying to shake off a blonde toupee. This works well for him \u8212\'20\'14 but he is also wilfully revisionist, which doesn't. The mob in the French Revolution was not a mob, he told us again and again and again. They were incredibly smart people who understood the importance of symbols. So, when they were defacing saints, scratching out fleurs-de-lys and toppling royal statues, it was in the name of artistic protest \u224\'00\'E0 la Banksy. And no matter how many times he said it, it wasn't convincing. Mobs tear down symbols of regimes (and fire up the guillotine) because they're angry with the regime. Art is not the cause, but a byproduct. Try telling that to an art historian. They just won't listen. c AA Gill is away\par \par \uc2 Matt Rudd\par \par \uc2 24 | Sky 1, Wed\par \par \uc2 When Corden Met Barlow BBC1,\par \par \uc2 In the Flesh BBC3, Sun\par \par \uc2 Billy Connolly's Big Send Off | ITV, Wed\par \par \uc2 The French Revolution\par \par \uc2 Tearing Up History | BBC4, Tue\par \par \uc2 spend It THE CRITICS\par \par \uc2 London provides a shadier, less teethwhitened location\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140511ea5b000ha\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

Confiscated ecstasy was down 41 per cent and cocaine fell by 18 per cent.\par \par \uc2 And almost 80million fewer illegal cigarettes were seized in the last three months of 2013, compared to the same period a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 The shock stats come after the borders watchdog found officers at \uc2 Stansted Airport\uc2  were taken off customs checks and moved to passport control instead. Labour shadow \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister \uc2 David Hanson\uc2  said: "The Home Secretary is failing to stop the flow of drugs and illegal cigarettes into the UK. This is more evidence this Government can't be trusted to protect our borders."\par \par \uc2 But \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister James Brokenshire insisted there was no "let up" in border activity, adding: "While the volume of drugs seized is down, the number of individual seizures has risen significantly."\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140511ea5b000dz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 DAVID CAMERON\uc2  makes a personal appeal to floating voters today to give him their backing in this month's European elections.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister is determined to assure sceptics that he understands their concerns on Europe.\par \par \uc2 Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, he proclaims his "passionate" and "optimistic" belief in Britain's potential, arguing that "real" patriots should vote Tory rather than be tempted to support the UK Independence Party.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron insists that despite overseeing deep public-spending cuts, the Conservatives do not care more about economic results from "gilt yields and bond markets" than about giving families peace of mind.\par \par \uc2 As postal ballot papers arrive in homes for the European elections, the Tory leader insists that he is not just another politician who will break his promises.\par \par \uc2 "If you're thinking 'I've heard all this before' - I get it," he says, before going on to offer his personal guarantee that he will resign as prime minister if he cannot deliver an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU after the election next year.\par \par \uc2 His rallying cry comes as Tory MPs demand new policies to win back Ukip voters, amid widespread expectations that Nigel Farage's party will beat the Conservatives into third place in the European elections on May 22.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  will return to the top of the agenda next week when official figures are expected to indicate that at least 30,000 more migrants from Romania and Bulgaria have moved to Britain for work in the past year, as border controls were relaxed.\par \par \uc2 Government statistics will show there was at least a 25 per cent rise in the number of migrants working in Britain from Europe's two poorest countries over the past 12 months, according to forecasts from \uc2 Oxford University\uc2 's Migration Observatory.\par \par \uc2 A series of recent polls have suggested that Ukip will force the Conservatives into third place in a national election for the first time in the party's history.\par \par \uc2 In his article, Mr Cameron responds to the rise in popularity of Mr Farage's party by setting out his own three key reasons why undecided voters should give him their vote.\par \par \uc2 "If your pencil is hovering over the Conservative box - or if you're wondering if you'll make it to the post box at all - I'm writing this directly to you," he says.\par \par \uc2 Only the Tories can deliver meaningful changes to the terms of Britain's membership of the EU, he says.\par \par \uc2 Only the Conservatives have a "long-term plan" for reforming Europe and rebuilding the British economy, based on the same values that inspired Baroness Thatcher, he says.\par \par \uc2 Finally, Mr Cameron insists that he is the only party leader who can be called a true patriot, because he is genuinely optimistic about Britain's future.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister makes a thinly veiled jibe at Mr Farage \u8212\'20\'14 although he declines to name him - for what he calls Ukip's permanently pessimistic outlook.\par \par \uc2 Ukip is constantly crying "we're all doomed", like the Dad's Army character, Pte Frazer, Mr Cameron suggests.\par \par \uc2 Tory MPs said the public was desperate for a meaningful response to migration from one of the mainstream parties and the Prime Minister's promise of an in-out referendum on EU membership was not enough.\par \par \uc2 Nigel Mills, the Conservative MP for Amber Valley, said: "On the doorstep, people fundamentally believe \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is too high.\par \par \uc2 "If we can't find a way to answer that, after a bad European election result, it is going to be a very hard situation for the powers that be.\par \par \uc2 "The key to the general election will be convincing the people who lent their vote to Ukip this time that they should vote Conservative. We have to show that we have heard their concerns."\par \par \uc2 Ukip will turn its fire on Ed Miliband this week, with posters claiming that pulling out of the EU would save families \u163\'00\'A3512 a year on food and power bills in a challenge to Labour's "cost of living" campaign.\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140511ea5b000ef\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 We're not all doomed: I know Britain is on the right track\b0\par\par\uc2 1,291 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 2; National\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 his weekend, many Sunday Telegraph readers will have received their postal votes for the European and local elections. If your pencil is hovering over the Conservative box \u8212\'20\'14 or if you're wondering whether you'll make it to the postbox at all \u8212\'20\'14 I'm writing this directly to you.\par \par \uc2 People used to say there is no choice in politics anymore. With these elections, that has been blown apart. There is a vigorous national debate going on, with clear water between all the different parties. I welcome that \u8212\'20\'14 and here I want to tell you the three things that distinguish the Conservative Party from the rest.\par \par \uc2 First: while other parties talk, Conservatives deliver. Nowhere is that more true than in Europe. Labour and the Liberal Democrats pay lip service to public opinion, but in reality think there's barely any need for change in Europe. Ukip talk about the national interest, then vote against it.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the mood music, there is only one party with a credible plan in Europe. I have set out, very clearly, the key areas we are renegotiating on: keeping our border controls; cracking down on benefit tourism; securing more trade; getting more control over justice and home affairs; and getting Britain out of "ever closer union". Once we've negotiated, whatever the outcome, the British people will have the final say on our future in Europe, with that in-out referendum in 2017.\par \par \uc2 If you're reading this thinking "I've heard all this before" - I get it. I was watching, too, when Labour made Britain the doormat of Europe and signed British taxpayers up to eurozone bail-out funds. So I understand the scepticism.\par \par \uc2 But if you want proof that we will deliver, just look at our record. Those bail-outs Labour signed us up to? I pulled us out of them. When there was an EU treaty that wasn't in our interests, I refused to sign it \u8212\'20\'14 the first British prime minister to do so. And we are the party who got the EU budget cut for the first time, saving British taxpayers \u163\'00\'A38.15billion.\par \par \uc2 We've proved we can deliver.\par \par \uc2 And as for that referendum? I have made a clear and personal commitment: I would not be Prime Minister of a government unless we could carry out our pledge of an inout referendum. This is a fundamental principle for me. So the lines are drawn: Labour and the Liberal Democrats won't give you a say. Ukip can't give you a say. It's only the Conservatives who can and will give you a say in that in-out referendum.\par \par \uc2 The second distinction is this: while other parties favour short-term gimmicks, we have set out a long-term plan that is turning Britain around.\par \par \uc2 It's a plan with five parts: reducing the deficit; cutting income tax; backing business to create more jobs; capping welfare and reducing \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ; and delivering the best schools and skills. It is a plan that is working, with the deficit down by more than a third, 26million people who have had their income tax cut, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  down, welfare capped, 250,000 fewer young people in failing schools and more people in work than ever before.\par \par \uc2 Most importantly, it is a plan driven by core Conservative beliefs: you shouldn't spend what you haven't earned; leave something better to the next generations; work is the best welfare there is; everyone should rise as high as their hard work will take them.\par \par \uc2 These are the values that inspired Margaret Thatcher to unleash a wave of small businesses and that drove Harold Macmillan to build a property-owning democracy. Our ultimate goal is not about gilt yields and bond markets, it is to give people more financial security; to give families more peace of mind; to help many more young people make the most of their talents and get on in life.\par \par \uc2 This is a long-term plan underpinned by our beliefs - and the contrast with Labour is stark. They've given us a succession of short-term gimmicks, underpinned by political opportunism: bank taxes they have "spent" 10 times over; an energy policy that turns out to be a con; a housing policy their own shadow housing minister said would not work in practice. They're flailing around because, ultimately, they have no ideas beyond the ones that got us into this mess \u8212\'20\'14 more spending, more borrowing, more taxes. The only party with a credible, long-term plan is the Conservative Party. The third distinction between us and the other parties is this: optimism vs pessimism.\par \par \uc2 It's been said that I was a sunny optimist in Opposition who became a grim realist in Government. I don't recognise that at all. I am more optimistic about Britain's future than I have ever been. That's because I've been to hundreds of offices, warehouses and labs across this country and seen Britain coming back. I've seen it in the faces of the entrepreneurs who come to Downing Street who have been unemployed, who got a \u163\'00\'A33,000 loan from the Government and who are now running their own businesses. This is optimism based on fact, not just faith.\par \par \uc2 But there are politicians who refuse to be upbeat about Britain. To them, pessimism equals patriotism. They insist that our best days are behind us and that everything is bound to get worse. Like Pte Frazer politicians, they are perennially crying out that "we're all doomed".\par \par \uc2 To me, real patriotism isn't running your country down at every opportunity, it is seeing its strengths and building on them \u8212\'20\'14 because time and again, the doom-mongers turn out to be wrong.\par \par \uc2 A few years ago, they said Britain was down and out; but now we're one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world. They said: "Jobs will be sucked away from our shores, never to return." But in recent years, we've seen several companies move production and services back to Britain, such as Hornby from India to Sussex, or EE from the Philippines to Northern Ireland.\par \par \uc2 The doom-mongers predicted that reducing public spending would slash a million jobs; but we've got 1.5million more people going out to work. They said that if there was a recovery, it would only be in London and the South East. But today, where are exports growing fastest? The West Midlands. Indeed, exports from there are set to grow three times faster than Germany's by 2017.\par \par \uc2 There is so much cause for confidence in Britain today. We have four of the world's top 10 universities. We have a higher employment rate than the USA for the first time since the Seventies. And we, the discoverers, inventors and chroniclers of gravity, DNA, penicillin and the web, are inventing more of the products and ideas that are shaping our world: the chip in your smartphone, the bionic arm, the latest in artificial intelligence.\par \par \uc2 We are not just celebrating this success, we're building on it: the first nuclear power station for a generation, the first new railway line north of London for 120 years, the biggest construction project in Europe in Crossrail. The Conservative Party is optimistic about Britain, and unashamedly thinking big for Britain. That is real patriotism.\par \par \uc2 So this is what the Conservatives offer: delivery over talk. Plans over gimmicks. Optimism over pessimism. Above all, the passionate con-fidence that Britain is on the right track.\par \par \uc2 If you believe these things too, then please \u8212\'20\'14 get out to vote, post your ballot, and have your say. Your vote matters.\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140511ea5b0009g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw337\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5055\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Mother of all battles?\b0\par\par\uc2 JANE MERRICK POLITICAL EDITOR   \par \uc2 1,077 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2014\par \uc2 Independent On Sunday\par \uc2 INDOS\par \uc2 2ND\par 24,25\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 News | Fathers are a group worth wooing Women's right to fight Apocalypse? The good news In the land of the dim ... We're all thin this together\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, leading female politicians from the three main parties attended the launch of Asda's "Mumdex Manifesto" in Parliament. The supermarket's "Mumdex" is a rolling survey of mothers' consumer confidence and concerns, and politicians are always keen to listen. Asda also claims that mothers contribute a hidden \u163\'00\'A337bn to the UK economy every year in unpaid work, care and voluntary help. Mums are certainly a valuable slice of the electorate.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, in the months before a general election, we are reminded that mothers will be the crucial swing voters: traditionally more likely to float, they are less tribal than men, considering policies on a case by case basis. In an election campaign, their votes are all to play for. So-called "mummy issues" such as childcare, education and caring for elderly parents are always prominent in manifestos. Yvette Cooper, representing Labour at the Mumdex event, said her party would be listening to the concerns of mothers at the school gate.\par \par \uc2 Yet, speaking as someone who will take her first trip to the school gate this September, I wonder whether we mums really are more powerful than our other halves? The two top doorstep issues are the economy and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - which are at least gender neutral. Turnout among men at the last election was 66 per cent, compared to 64 per cent of women. Men over 35 are more likely to be fathers than their younger male counterparts, and they are also more likely to vote than younger men and women generally - turnout in this group was 72 per cent at the last election. Turnout among women over 35 was 70 per cent. Mothers make up less than a quarter of voters. It seems the establishment is missing an opportunity to listen to dads.\par \par \uc2 Fathers have had a difficult image in recent political history. While the most prominent group for mothers has been Mumsnet, the highest-profile group for dads has been \uc2 Fathers 4 Justice\uc2 . As earnest as their superhero-clad campaigners were, I am not sure most fathers feel represented by them. The Fatherhood Institute does more serious political work, but doesn't enjoy the same coverage as Mumsnet.\par \par \uc2 Dads get a raw deal politically too: in the last Conservative manifesto, the words "dad" or "father" did not appear; while in Labour and Lib Dem brochures they were mentioned only in the context of shared parental leave. Yet every dad I know has a keen interest in education, the \uc2 NHS\uc2 , elderly care and, yes, childcare. With more women, including mothers, at work than ever before, surely it follows that more fathers are involved in household duties - from the daily trip to the school gate, organising a childminder or struggling with the weekly shop. Despite \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband all having young children and playing up to their "ordinary dad" images, can their parties say they understand the concerns of the nation's fathers?\par \par \uc2 Of course, women are under-represented in politics and in many households it is the mother who worries about finding enough money for the supermarket shop. But it's not too late for Asda to launch a "Daddex".\par \par \uc2 A battle for all women\par \par \uc2 This focus on mothers doesn't mean the world has stopped telling women how we should think and act. Last week, it was Steve Davis telling us that female snooker players weren't mentally focused enough to compete with men at the highest level. Now we have former head of the Army, Lord Dannatt, saying the plan to allow women soldiers to bear arms cannot work because they would be unable to "follow orders and \u8230\'20\'26 attack a village".\par \par \uc2 Other critics of Defence Secretary Philip Hammond's plan for women on the frontline say it would upset the "cohesiveness" of the corps. As someone with a relative in the Army, I know the majority of soldiers - male or female - do not relish killing. Being a soldier is about professionalism and defence, not bloodthirstiness. Yet men like Davis and Dannatt obviously think women are scatter-brained, unprofessional rebels.\par \par \uc2 Armageddon out of here\par \par \uc2 This was a "good" story from Hammond, normally a minister who gives little away, and a progressive line from someone on the right of the Tory Party. In his speech at the press gallery lunch, he also revealed that underneath the Ministry of Defence lies the bunker where the Cabinet would sit out a nuclear Armageddon. There are bedrooms for all Cabinet ministers, yet only one chamber has a double bed - for David and Samantha Cameron. Hammond cheekily said that the future of the human race would be in their hands, as it were.\par \par \uc2 Pickles shuns the limelight\par \par \uc2 How does Eric Pickles sleep at night? Very well, he says, because the streetlights outside his window have been turned off. But the Communities Secretary's own party's councillors in Essex are concerned that in Basildon all streetlights are switched off between midnight and 5am. Women's safety groups and the AA are alarmed at nationwide figures, gathered by Labour, that show that 750,000 streetlamps in 81 council areas have been dimmed or switched off at night. Pickles says not only can he see the stars, it stops burglars thriving in the "ambient light". I don't know about you, but if there's a burglar on my street as I walk home after dark I'd rather it wasn't pitch black.\par \par \uc2 Georgie Porgie, puddin' and pie\par \par \uc2 I wonder whether George Osborne was on one of his 5:2 diet off days on Thursday when aides tried to get him a table at the Thyme Deli and Caf\u233\'00\'E9 in Horwich, Bolton. Caf\u233\'00\'E9 owner Amanda Biggs, whose menu includes Tracklements chutneys, Lottie Shaws parkin, fresh local Lancashire cheeses, Patchwork pates and Huntley's Moo 2 You ice cream, turned away the Chancellor's party because she was too busy.\par \par \uc2 A pity she couldn't lay on a Lancashire spread, because I think Osborne's diet has gone too far. I hope I don't offend - and plenty of comments are routinely made elsewhere about the appearance of female MPs - he has lost too much weight on this fad diet. It is the madness of thin George.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @janemerrick23\par \par \uc2 Document INDOS00020140511ea5b00014\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Nick Clegg's blunt solution to knife crime\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nick Ferrari   \par \uc2 1,304 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2014\par 01:00\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \uc2 IT IS very easy to have a go at Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, last week the Labour party, bizarrely, decided to devote its entire party political broadcast to belittling him, seeking to portray him as a bullied, put upon wimp who is routinely ignored by Coalition Cabinet colleagues.\par \par \uc2 Never mind that top of most sane people\u8217\'20\'19s worry list is the economy, jobs, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , national security or the state of the health service, Labour lavished a considerable sum to send up Nick Clegg in a film that was humourless, pointless and left most people feeling they could not care less.\par \par \uc2 As someone in the media who probably knows Mr Clegg as well as anyone I can assure you he is too robust and steadfast for this to have fazed him for even a heartbeat.\par \par \uc2 However, what desperately does require more scrutiny is his avowed intent to block Conservative plans for a crackdown on knife crime.\par \par \uc2 This was promised in David Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s manifesto in 2010 but was another victim of the fact that the Tories managed to blast the ball over the bar in front of the empty goal of that general election and needed a coalition with the Lib Dems to get into power.\par \par \uc2 In truth, the commentators and political chatterati have been deeply dismayed by how little the Coalition has fought and how well, in most areas, it has performed.\par \par \uc2 Hence they seize on any bit of discord and treat it as if it were fisticuffs across the Cabinet table.\par \par \uc2 This bold stance by Clegg could be the one, however, that causes a good old-fashioned rumpus and possibly demonstrates that despite taking all the calls we have done together down the months, he might not always have been listening.\par \par \uc2 Partly spurred on by the stabbing to death of a teacher in her classroom, the Conservatives want to introduce automatic jail terms for repeat knife offenders, a \u8220\'20\'1Ctwo strikes and you\u8217\'20\'19re in\u8221\'20\'1D kind of policy but Clegg is adamantly against it.\par \par \uc2 He dismisses it as an attempt to introduce \u8220\'20\'1Cheadline-grabbing solutions\u8221\'20\'1D in the wake of the killing of Ann Maguire.\par \par \uc2 He goes on to claim it could \u8220\'20\'1Cturn the young offenders of today into the hardened criminals of tomorrow\u8221\'20\'1D and calls it \u8220\'20\'1Ca backwards step that will undermine the Government\u8217\'20\'19s rehabilitation revolution\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 This is high stakes stuff for Mr Clegg and if, as is being mooted, the Labour party opts to support the Conservatives, at a time when the Lib Dems\u8217\'20\'19 poll ratings are bouncing on the bottom and in one case they are being beaten even by the Green Party, Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s party risks being stranded on a political peninsula.\par \par \uc2 Clegg is a shrewd strategist and is that rare politician who usually actually stands by his beliefs, however unpopular they might be.\par \par \uc2 As the calls came in last week, he did not move an inch on his trenchant opposition, even if his rather convoluted argument \u8220\'20\'1Cit could mean an electrician could be sent to prison for going to work with a penknife\u8221\'20\'1D seemed as big a stretch as you are ever likely to witness outside of a gymnast\u8217\'20\'19s workout.\par \par \uc2 The likelihood of the \uc2 Crown Prosecution Service\uc2  seeking such a conviction could best be described as remote.\par \par \uc2 Experts in the field support the move.\par \par \uc2 Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said it was time for \u8220\'20\'1Ca proper and objective look at youth sentencing... in controlling the use of knives.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe agreed and pointed out it has worked extremely well in controlling the use of guns as everyone knows they will get a minimum of five years inside.\par \par \uc2 Sir Bernard added that there is every reason it would work equally well in combating the problem of knives.\par \par \uc2 If Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s opposition is a principled stance it is to be admired but in no way whatsoever does that detract from the fact that he could very well be incorrect and surely in an area as potentially dangerous and sometimes lethal as knife crime, it is worth heeding the advice of the police and the judiciary.\par \par \uc2

\par \uc2 Miley's Bangerz tour has caused controversy across the UK [GETTY]\par \par \uc2 EVER since the first television was thrown from the first hotel bedroom window, the first car driven into a swimming pool and the first star snarled at a hapless interviewer, the big names of rock and pop have been out to shock.\par \par \uc2 They have run the whole gamut from appearing virtually naked to wearing much of a zoo on their head.\par \par \uc2 They have sworn, said offensive things about every religious leader ever known, been rude to disabled people and in the infamous case of Prince, refused to speak whatsoever, even when collecting an award.\par \par \uc2 However there does come a point at which they clearly rock right off their block and Miley Cyrus appears to have reached and crashed through it last week.\par \par \uc2 In one show at the O2, she gyrated inappropriately, said the F-word 79 times and even introduced the C-word to her tacky act.\par \par \uc2 As many of her young fans were attracted to her in her Hannah Montana Disney incarnation, this is surely beyond tasteless.\par \par \uc2 Message to Miley: you were not brought up in a

\par \uc2 David Cameron needs to justify this waste of cash [GETTY]\par \par \uc2 IN JANUARY this year, the Government boasted it would increase the amount of foreign aid given to Nigeria from \u163\'00\'A3200million a year to \u163\'00\'A3270million.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron seems as hooked on this foolish waste of money as a drug addict is on his next fix.\par \par \uc2 It takes the sum total of money doled out to Nigeria into the billions of pounds.\par \par \uc2 Now, just months later we see the corrupt and inept administration of President Goodluck Jonathan in all its ineffectual light.\par \par \uc2 Having turned its back on the festering problem of hardline Islamic fundamentalism and the rapid growth of terror group Boko Haram, the Nigerian government is now pleading for help to find the 200-plus teenage girls who have been abducted and are to be sold as slaves for as little as \u163\'00\'A37 a head in actions that would defy the worst script line Hollywood could invent.\par \par \uc2 Could Mr Cameron kindly step forward and justify all the cash we have sent to this administration which, it has been reported, has also been criticised over the country\u8217\'20\'19s escalating rate of sectarian murders?\par \par \uc2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\par \par \uc2 DOCTORS are to debate later this month the proposal to charge patients for appointments.\par \par \uc2 The predictable and dreary socialist class warriors took to the airwaves instantly and proclaimed that this was a betrayal of all that the \uc2 NHS\uc2  stood for and reacted as if the sick and the dying would be ignored or turfed out on to the streets from their surgeries.\par \par \uc2 It is not like that whatsoever and the solution is simple.\par \par \uc2 If anyone wants to pay the charge, likely to be anywhere between \u163\'00\'A310 and \u163\'00\'A325, they should be free to do so but they should also be able to request an appointment in the evening or weekends.\par \par \uc2 That frees up surgery capacity for everyone else but, sadly, this is one cure the \uc2 NHS\uc2  will never offer as no political party has the nerve to support it.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140511ea5b00037\par }\page

Brussels is braced for a historic breakthrough for Eurosceptic parties in this month's elections, as polls across the EU show they could obtain as much as 30% of the vote and up to 200 MEPs.\par \par \uc2 The Front National leads French polls, having campaigned on a platform of withdrawal from the euro and a crackdown on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . The party's leader, Marine Le Pen, and the Dutch far-right populist Geert Wilders are hoping to form a new anti-EU alliance of at least seven parties within the European parliament.\par \par \uc2 The grouping could include the Flemish nationalists of Vlaams Belang and the Italian separatists of the Northern League. Meanwhile, the Italian comic Beppe Grillo's grassroots Five Star Movement, which is campaigning for an Italian referendum on the euro, is on course to win 25% of the vote and send more than 20 MEPs to the Strasbourg parliament. In the last European elections in 2009, Ukip won 13 seats and could double that number in these elections with a share of the vote that could be as high as 30%.\par \par \uc2 In today's report on the rise of Euroscepticism, the celebrated Italian satirist and playwright Dario Fo backs Grillo's calls for a referendum on the single currency.\par \par \uc2 Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and leader of the Liberal group in Strasbourg, told the Observer: "You will see a kind of victory for the Eurosceptics in the election. But that will hopefully lead to the emergence of a pro-European electorate and eventually to the new leap forward that we need."\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140510ea5b00032\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Leading Lib Dems step up their campaign against the Tory Education Secretary, accusing him of raiding \u163\'00\'A3400 million from a budget for new school places to fund his "pet project"\par \par \uc2 A major Coalition row broke out last night after Liberal Democrats accused Michael Gove of raiding \u163\'00\'A3400million from a fund to ease overcrowding in classrooms to \u8220\'20\'1Clavish\u8221\'20\'1D on his flagship \u8220\'20\'1Cfree schools\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 David Laws, the Lib Dem Schools Minister, was said to have raised serious concerns after the Education Secretary proposed using the money to fill an \u163\'00\'A3800million shortfall in the budget for the free schools.\par \par \uc2 However, Mr Gove overruled Mr Laws and senior {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Lib Dems}}}\uc2  are now furious that the Education Secretary has put his \u8220\'20\'1Cideological\u8221\'20\'1D obsession with free schools ahead of the need for more school places.\par \par \uc2 One source said the budget for Mr Gove\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cpet project\u8221\'20\'1D of free schools was \u8220\'20\'1Cout of control\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Councils in parts of London and the South east, as well as other urban areas, are facing an intense demand for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/primaryeducation/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 primary school}}}\uc2  places as a result of rising \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and higher birth rates.\par \par \uc2 Last September the Local Government Association, representing councils, warned that almost half of England\u8217\'20\'19s school districts were facing a shortage of school places, with some as much as 20 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Government sources disclosed that Mr Gove cut the \u8220\'20\'1Cbasic need\u8221\'20\'1D budget, from \u163\'00\'A32.75 billion to \u163\'00\'A32.35 billion between 2015 and 2017 to help fund an overspend in the Free Schools budget of around \u163\'00\'A3800million between 2013 and 2016.\par \par \uc2 The basic need budget is given by the Department for Education to local authorities to ensure that there are enough school places. Councils can use the money to build new schools or expand existing ones to meet rising demand and \u163\'00\'A3400 million would have provided up to 30,000 new places, a senior government source said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEverybody knows there\u8217\'20\'19s real pressure on school places at the moment and the Secretary of State for Education knows better than most,\u8221\'20\'1D the source said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is nothing short of lunacy to slash the amount of money available for new school places to lavish on free schools. Michael Gove was warned by the David Laws that this was a bad idea but the zealot pressed on anyway.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A Conservative source described the claims as \u8220\'20\'1Cnonsense\u8221\'20\'1D and "pathetic" behaviour from the Lib Dems.\par \par \uc2 The source added: "They voted for free schools and backed them from the start. For the Lib Dems to now attack them is frankly risible."\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Mr Gove said the Lib Dem claims were "simply not true".\par \par \uc2 "The suggestion that we are cutting money for new places in areas of need to pay for free schools where they are not needed is totally wrong," he added.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140510ea5a004sb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Local elections: Potholes, badgers and Ukip: Lib Dems primed for battle: Farage challenge and local issues exercise spa town Clegg's party battling to retain control of council\b0\par\par\uc2 Steven Morris   \par \uc2 876 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The bullet points on the whiteboard at the Liberal Democrats' headquarters in Cheltenham remind its candidates and activists of the wide range of subjects they may face on the campaign trail in Gloucestershire: the economy, Europe, the badger cull, the bottleneck on the A417 dual carriageway.\par \par \uc2 "But what most people want to talk about on the doorstep at local election time is the very local stuff - potholes, refuse collection, recycling, things like that," said party worker Chris Ward. "I suppose some might think it's boring, but it is important for people."\par \par \uc2 With the local elections less than two weeks away, the Lib Dem office bustles with activity. Workers are in and out to pick up leaflets, study lists of voters, talk strategy. "It's no problem getting workers up for it," said Ward, who describes his role as geeing up the volunteers. "They're keen and motivated."\par \par \uc2 Which is just as well. The local elections in Cheltenham are important, not just on a local level but as a test of where Nick Clegg's party is at as it gears up for next year's general election. According to most polls, 22 May is not going to be pretty for Lib Dem supporters, but the party's spinners insist that every battle is fought on the ground, on local issues, and not necessarily its national record.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems and Tories have long fought for control of the spa town, best known as the spiritual home of national hunt racing - the highlight is the March festival - and the headquarters of GCHQ, the intelligence and security agency.\par \par \uc2 In 2010, the Lib Dems won an overall majority on the borough council. It was also one of the few places in the country where the orange vote held up strong at the 2012 local elections when the national party's dalliance with power was alienating supporters almost everywhere else.\par \par \uc2 At that point, with 25 members, it was in firm control of the 40-strong council. Since then, the grip has loosened a little: one member became an independent after falling out with the party over plans to build on green spaces and the Tories pinched a seat in a byelection.\par \par \uc2 This time round, half the seats are up for grabs. The Lib Dems are defending 12 of them. And the Ukip factor will play a bigger part than ever before. Nigel Farage's party won three \uc2 Gloucestershire county council\uc2  seats last year and is fielding 11 candidates in these local elections - more than Labour. It is not inconceivable that the Lib Dems could lose overall control of Cheltenham.\par \par \uc2 Council leader Steve Jordan accepted that the election was an important test of the party before next year's general election, when MP Martin Horwood will be defending a 4,920 majority.\par \par \uc2 "This is a dry run for that," said Jordan. "We're working hard in areas we might not usually work quite so hard in, partly so we'll be ready for next year."\par \par \uc2 Jordan believes the Lib Dem message that it has worked hard - within the coalition - for the country was getting through. "I think people see we have done good things. I also think people are up for a conversation because of the uncertainty over things like the coalition and Ukip.\par \par \uc2 "People used to be certain about their politics - you were born Conservative or Labour and we were the third party. There's less certainty now."\par \par \uc2 Ukip claims it is doing well in a wide range of neighbourhoods, from working class areas (as working class as Cheltenham gets) to upmarket rural settlements.\par \par \uc2 The party is campaigning hard on that sticky issue of building homes on greenfield sites, as it did when it beat the Conservatives into third place at the Eastleigh parliamentary byelection last year. But Christina Simmonds, the Ukip branch chair, said she believed her party's core messages on Europe and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  were making sense here.\par \par \uc2 "We're finding people are coming to us rather than us having to go to them. We're hoping for a couple of seats or more."\par \par \uc2 The Tories] have produced a glossy manifesto outlining cost-cutting policies, including reducing the number of councillors and moving the authority out of its Grade II-listed, town centre municipal offices. It also claims it will reduce council tax by 3%. "I think we can take seats off the Lib Dems this year," said Tory group leader Rob Garnham. "They are running out of ideas and looking tired."\par \par \uc2 Andy Williams, a Lib Dem campaigns assistant, was having none of it. "It's all about getting out there, interacting with the voters, talking. We're good at that. People won't vote for you if they don't know you. It's bloody obvious really."\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Defending a majority - Steve Jordan, right, Lib Dem leader of \uc2 Cheltenham council\uc2  and party worker Chris Ward Photograph: Adrian Sherratt\par \par \uc2 25\par \par \uc2 Number of seats out of 40 Cheltenham Lib Dems held in 2012.

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Review Pages\par \b \uc2 Review: FICTION: The Ladykiller: Mark Lawson is absorbed by a retelling of the real-life murders of widows and spinsters: Quiet Dell by Jayne Anne Phillips 443pp, Jonathan Cape, pounds 18.99\b0\par\par\uc2 Mark Lawson   \par \uc2 923 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The names of the characters are often a giveaway sign that fiction is based on fact. Sensible novelists avoid scenes featuring two speakers with the same names, but write a novel about the Kennedy administration and inevitably men called John keep having conversations.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, readers would normally groan at a book whose characters included a lawyer called Law, a Virginia courtroom run by one Judge Southern, and a police force under the control of Sheriff Grimm. Jayne Anne Phillips can't avoid such punning personnel, though, because that is what they were really called. Quiet Dell, her fifth novel, is based on the crimes and trial, in the early 1930s, of a serial killer who, under various names including Pierson and Powers, contacted widows and spinsters through dating agencies and deprived them of their savings and then their lives.\par \par \uc2 "The press will be a huge problem in this case," says Sheriff Grimm here, and he is proved correct. Powers (originally a Dutch-American \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  called Harm Drench) was one of the first American murderers to become a media sensation, dubbed "Bluebeard" or "The Ladykiller" in press coverage of his "love racket".\par \par \uc2 Anticipating \uc2 eBay\uc2 's darker markets by eight decades, relics of the deaths were sold on the street by morbid opportunists, including alleged fragments of the soundproofed wood that lined the hut in which the murders occurred. In a closing note on sources, the author reveals that she was sent one of the numbered splinters after mentioning the case, which has long obsessed her, in her debut novel, Machine Dreams\par \par \uc2 The documentary origins of this latest book are underlined by the inclusion of period photographs, while one entire chapter consists of newspaper cuttings and verbatim witness statements. Even a Boston terrier called Duty - who may become, for some readers, too sentimentally central a focus of the story - is photographically verified.\par \par \uc2 The novelist's way into the material is through Duty's owners: Asta Eicher, the artistic widow of a Chicago silversmith, and her three young children. It is a standard complaint about crime writing that the murder victims are often scarcely established as characters; created merely to be dispatched. Avoiding this, Phillips allocates a retrospectively heartbreaking 60 pages to the Eicher family alive, at Christmas 1930, as elder daughter Annabel stages a play, and as her mother rejects a potential suitor in favour of the loving letters from a correspondent, Cornelius O Pierson, whom she is about to meet for the first time.\par \par \uc2 But, after four chapters, in a daring structural decision, the Eichers vanish from the narrative in a way that successfully mimics for the reader the shock and confusion of their disappearance from home. What happened to them and many other victims - climaxing in the West Virginia hamlet that gives the book its name - is obliquely approached through other perspectives. These include Pierson but, most often, one of the few invented characters: Emily Thornhill, a reporter with the Chicago Herald Tribune and a rare woman among the press corps of the period.\par \par \uc2 One of the justifications for historical literature is giving voice to perspectives to which contemporary accounts were deaf and Phillips' emphasis is on the treacherous destinies - personal and professional - that society decreed for women then. In one of the novel's many flashes of insight, Emily understands why the serial killer "succeeded with these women in mid-life, women likely already ravaged by men or fortune; they wanted care and protection".\par \par \uc2 They also eagerly believed the fantasy they were offered of a better life. The novel's key line is Emily's observation: "People are so influenced by appearances." The story is a web of pretence in which every major player is living some kind of lie, whether malevolent or benevolent. Apart from the killer's multiple seductive personae, Emily lives the outward life of a spinster in order to avoid the scandal that might ensue from her relationship with a married man, who must also cover his tracks, while Emily's co-reporter at the trial is a homosexual required by the times to hide his sexuality.\par \par \uc2 These disguises spawn many metaphors of acting and theatricality - "They were all here to play their parts, and the production was finally starting" - which are beginning to risk seeming over-emphatic when they are justified by the astonishing fact that, owing to the numbers of public and press wishing to attend, the Bluebeard trial took place on the stage of a West Virginia opera house, with the judge sitting in front of painted scenery depicting a small American town, and the barristers ordering adjustments to the lighting.\par \par \uc2 An occasional tendency towards mawkishness, threatened by each appearance of the dog, is also present in passages narrated by one of the dead Eicher children, which, for me, brought back unwelcome memories of Alice Sebold's bestseller The Lovely Bones. In total, though, Quiet Dell is an absorbing and captivating retelling of the birth of one force for good - female empowerment - and of another progressvely destructive trend: scandalous and disproportionate reporting of crime.\par \par \uc2 Mark Lawson's The Deaths is published by Picador.

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Review Pages\par \b \uc2 Review: NON-FICTION: The miracle and the mystery of Chaplin: A haunting life captures the objectionable man behind the divine comedy: Charlie Chaplin by Peter Ackroyd 272pp, Chatto, pounds 14.99\b0\par\par\uc2 Simon Callow   \par \uc2 2,213 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 "In this year, 1915," begins a chapter halfway through Peter Ackroyd's concise, compelling new biography, "Chaplin became the most famous man in the world." This fact is so extraordinary - so improbable, in the light of his origins - that it is allowed to stand alone, a paragraph in itself. Chaplin was 26 years old in 1915. He had been born into south London poverty, the offspring of an unknown father and a mother whose brief career as a singer and dancer came to an end when Charlie was a boy; from then on, until her death in an asylum in Los Angeles, her sanity came and went. Before long, the man she had been married to at the time of Charlie's birth, and whose name he bore and made immortal, dumped her, as did several subsequent paramours; when she was incapable of looking after Charlie and his brother, they stayed with relatives or lodged in the workhouse.\par \par \uc2  His education was skimpy and fitful; it ended at the age of nine, when, having taught himself clog-dancing, he first took to the stage as one of the Eight Lancashire Lads, and nearly became part of a double act called Bristol and Chaplin, the Millionaire Tramps. A millionaire tramp, of course, is exactly what he would end up as. But not without having put in some serious slog on the way.\par \par \uc2 After gruelling hard work on the road and a spell as a boy actor, he signed up with the king of comedy, a tough taskmaster called Fred Karno, under whose unrelenting tutelage in the art of physical comedy his genius as a performer first fully emerged. By the age of 20 he was a star, billed as Chaplin the Inebriate - an act studied at close quarters from his stepfather. The character of the drunk, Chaplin said, possessed him; playing it, he experienced a kind of out-of-body sensation: "It was almost a psychic sort of thing." When Karno took the troupe to Paris, Debussy invited Chaplin to his box. "Monsieur Chaplin," he said, "vous etes instinctivement un musicien et un danseur." And funny, he might have added; deeply, uproariously, side-huggingly funny. On stage, at any rate: Chaplin seems to have been no fun at all in life - morose, private, obsessed. He played his violin and his cello; he read Schopenhauer; he had sex with bad girls; and he planned ever more fantastical comedy conceptions. All along, his heart was set on world domination. "America!" he shouted as the ship berthed in Quebec for Karno's first tour there in 1910, "I am coming to conquer you. Every man woman and child shall have my name on their lips: Charles Spencer Chaplin!" Their first offering, The Wow-Wows, was a no-no, but a quick revival of their old standby A Night at an English Music Hall knocked 'em sideways, and it was Chaplin above all who shone. On their next tour, in 1913, the company manager received a life-changing telegram: "IS THERE A MAN NAMED CHAFFIN IN YOUR COMPANY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?" Mack Sennett of the Keystone Cops needed to replace his refractory No 1 male comedian; Chaplin never hesitated for a moment, and left the stage for good as soon as he could.\par \par \uc2 His first film was Making a Living; his second, Kid Auto Races at Venice, gave the world the character of the Little Tramp, who was an instant hit with the public from the beginning. But Chaplin was not easy to work with; his unrelenting perfectionism annoyed his directors and his fellow performers. He was already indispensable to Sennett, however, who acceded to Chaplin's demand to be allowed to direct his own films. It was then that his demon really manifested itself. He spent two, three, sometimes 10 times as much time on each film as his colleagues, and the result was double, triple, 10 times as popular with the public. His second two-reeler as a director, Caught in a Cabaret, was hailed by New York Dramatic Mirror as "the funniest picture that has ever been produced"; thereafter he produced film after film, each seeming to outstrip the other in invention and comic frenzy. Starting from the most tenuous idea, he worked at white heat, improvising, discarding unpromising ideas, refining successful ones. Chaplin was not interested in the possibilities of the camera - it was character, action and narrative that fascinated him. He was giving the cinema its foundations, its first classics, filled with poetry, pain, passion but all within the parameters of consummately achieved comedy. As Ackroyd remarks, "he, like Shakespeare, had the inestimable advantage of being an instinctive artist in the preliminary years of a new art".\par \par \uc2 Creative inspiration at this level is terrifying, a kind of divine fire; it can rarely be sustained. Chaplin constantly dreaded the loss of his powers of invention, but for nearly 30 years of non-stop work, they did not fail him; it is arguable that but for the coming of sound, they might never have failed him. The introduction of the word into the equation diluted and diminished his genius. Genius is not too strong a word to use, in all three capacities - as director, as scenarist and, supremely, as performer. In this area, his virtuosity is on the level of a Paganini, an Art Tatum, but it is so much more multifarious, combining the clowning of a Grock or a Grimaldi with the feather-light terpsichorean skills of an Astaire and the acting abilities of a Garbo or an Olivier. The final sequence of City Lights, in which, as Ackroyd says, the Tramp, left alone, simultaneously expresses exaltation and terror was, said James Agee, America's best film critic, "enough to shrivel the heart to see, and . . . the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies". Increasingly Chaplin tackled what was real for working people, his core audience: the Depression, alienation in big cities, the heartlessness of modern factory life. In exquisitely choreographed form, the Tramp embodied the basic needs of humankind - love, food, self-respect - as well as its modi vivendi: jealousy, rage, cupidity, lust.\par \par \uc2 As a man, Chaplin was barely human at all. He surrendered to his obsessions. This tiny, ithyphallic man - Ackroyd discreetly alludes to his legendary genital endowment and his unflagging but joyless sexual marathons - was, like many of the dominant figures of any given time, driven by the need to impose himself on the world, to enforce on it his definition of reality. In art, he succeeded in these ambitions; in life, he failed. People had a way of fighting back, particularly the women with whom he was involved, the majority of whom were childish, doll-like figures whose innocence he sought to possess but who had the disloyalty, in his view, to become pregnant, thus compelling him to marry them. After that, whatever feelings he had for them turned to hate. This pattern led him twice to the divorce courts, in which extremely explicit accusations regarding his sexual demands were made very public. "A grey-haired old buzzard," the counsel for the prosecution said in a paternity case brought against him by one of his mistresses, "a little runt of a Svengali . . . a debaucher". Unsurprisingly, the script he was working on at the time, Monsieur Verdoux, is informed with savage misogyny; in it, Verdoux, played by Chaplin, serially marries women and then kills them, bringing back their money to his real wife, who is pretty - and blind, which is no doubt how he would have preferred his women.\par \par \uc2 In the end, on a trip to Europe, he was barred from re-entering the US, on the basis both of his supposed immorality and his communistic affiliations. During the war and after, Chaplin had made statements of solidarity with Soviet Russia that became toxic during the anti-Communist witch-hunts of the late 40s and early 50s. Although there was no hard evidence against him, he was publicly reviled. He had by now, in his early 60s, run out of creative energy. His first film with sound, The Great Dictator, a whimsical but nonetheless oddly powerful anti-Hitler fable (made in the face of considerable hostility from Hollywood), shows a remarkably assured response to the challenge of what was in effect for him a new medium; the second, Monsieur Verdoux, is mordantly elegant, but the third, Limelight, his last film to be made in America, and full of deep nostalgia for the old days of music hall, is verbose and flaccid. The last two films, both made in Britain, are simply feeble. He retired into a relatively becalmed old age, coddled by his last wife - Eugene O'Neill's daughter, Oona - though there could still be outbursts and tantrums; his strict control over his children he never relinquished.\par \par \uc2 It is hard not to see Chaplin as essentially childlike, though not in any sentimental sense of the phrase. Like Dickens, his childhood was arrested at a young age, after which he had to fight the world if he was not to go under. His life was governed by the little boy's need to put himself beyond the reach of circumstances. He hated his dependency on anyone else - and film, of all arts, is the one most dependent on cooperation. "I did it all!" cried Chaplin, but of course he couldn't. Ackroyd sees him as utterly self-absorbed - for him, others were merely tools of his need. Like Wagner, whom he resembles in startling ways, he was a kind of demiurge, creating a world in the furnace of his art. For The \b \uc2 Immigrant\b0 \uc2  he shot 40,000 feet of film, which he reduced to 1,800. This is his real genius: his sense of the mutability of the material. He worked with film as a sculptor works with clay. And such was his success that he could take as long as he wanted, retake as much as needed, sack actors, rebuild sets, until he finally arrived at the result he needed. The whole of Chaplin's work is a triumph of the will. No wonder he studied Schopenhauer so avidly: the very title of the German philosopher's masterwork, The World as Will and Representation, must have spoken to him deeply. The miracle and the mystery of Chaplin is that the work that results from this epic exercise of will is so playful.\par \par \uc2 There have been more analytically incisive books on Chaplin - Parker Tyler's superb Chaplin: Last of the Clowns, for instance - and more comprehensive ones, David Robinson's monumental biography among them, but Ackroyd's is the most haunting. His method, filtering the life through the prism of his novelist's imagination, plunges you, in unsettling fashion, right into the subject's own experience. His assessment of the films is perceptive, though he is unduly dismissive of Chaplin's My Autobiography, the first third of which, reissued by the publisher as My Early Days, is one of the masterpieces of theatre literature. Ackroyd is obsessed by what his publisher calls "our great London imagination" and rather tenuously attempts to recruit Chaplin to the cause. He tells us that when Chaplin went back to London "he was going back to the source of his life and inspiration", but it is not clear whether he is speaking of his subject or himself.\par \par \uc2 Ackroyd also has a tendency to think that when actors aren't acting, they are nothing. He should perhaps have remembered what Dickens said about his friend Fechter: "The more real the man, the better the actor." Chaplin was real enough, all right: his reality may have been somewhat alarming, but there was nothing false about it. But Ackroyd really knows this already: his analysis of the Tramp - the "little fellow", Chaplin's greatest creation - is brilliant and unsparing. "He can be cunning, cruel and hostile; he has a taste for brutality; he bites his opponents and can engage in unchecked malice; he can conjure up a sickly grin or the imbecilic smile of a drunk . . . he sticks out his nose and he sticks out his tongue; he exhibits an almost elfin wickedness; he is leering and lascivious, propositioning almost every woman whom he encounters." In other words, he is all of us. "He colludes with his audience all the time." Ackroyd sees all of this with clarity; he summons up all of the pity and the terror of Chaplin's life; above all, perhaps, he sees how close to insanity Chaplin was. Often, his cameraman reported, the comedian would quietly sing to himself: "Oh ever since that fatal night / Me wife's gone mad; / Awfully queer, / Touched just here." And on the last line, with great deliberation, he would slowly raise his hand and tap his temple. Chilling, wonderful stuff.\par \par \uc2 To order Charlie Chaplin for pounds 11.99 with free UK p&p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Utterly self-absorbed . . .

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 I'm 45 and was born in Cameroon. I'm an economic investigative journalist and now live in Glasgow. Almost a decade ago I fled Cameroon because of revelations about government finances. I was detained and tortured, but with the help of family friends I was able to escape to the UK. I was in the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system for seven years, unable to work and threatened with being deported home, where I would almost certainly have been killed. A huge campaign led by NUJ journalists in Glasgow allowed me to remain here. Since being released, I have worked for the Scottish Council and the Community Information Source, which helps asylum seekers.\par \par \uc2 The Guardian has always been the only newspaper to give a true representation of the circumstances of asylum seekers and refugees. It gives a fair picture of what is happening without accusing individuals of being "scroungers" or "lazy". I find the financial pages really interesting and well-balanced. One of the main things is the Guardian's commitment to freedom of speech and exposing the truth about society - as someone who had this right taken away, I cannot express how important it is.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140510ea5a00034\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

As his revival transfers to London's West End, Richard Eyre refelcts on how the songs have haunted him since childhood\b0\par\par\uc2 Richard Eyre   \par \uc2 1,965 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Pajama Game was the first musical I heard - I say "heard" because until April last year, when I directed it at the Chichester Festival Theatre I'd never seen it, or at least only in the rather unsatisfactory 1957 film starring Doris Day. It was one of the first albums that my sister owned and, like it or not, I was obliged at the age of 12 to listen to the British cast of the West End production until I knew the score backwards. I've been haunted by it ever since. I had never seen a musical in a theatre. I had never seen a play in a theatre. So for a while, until she bought My Fair Lady and West Side Story and I bought Bill Haley, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Buddy Holly and Tommy Steele, the vinyl version of The Pajama Game was the centre of my musical and theatrical universe.\par \par \uc2 The pedigree of The Pajama Game was impeccable - its collaborators were all, or became, the aristocracy of Broadway: George Abbott, Richard Adler, Jerome Robbins, Hal Prince and Bob Fosse. The dialogue and construction - the "book" - were in the hands of Abbott, who was writer or director and sometimes producer of a host of hits including Pal Joey, On the Town, Where's Charley?, Call Me Madam, Damn \uc2 Yankees\uc2  and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Abbott directed The Pajama Game as well as writing the book. A tall, authoritative, even imperious, figure, supremely well-organised, brisk and unsentimental, he was known universally as "Mr Abbott". While he was opening two shows on Broadway - Leonard Bernstein's Wonderful Town and Rogers and Hammerstein's Me and Juliet - he was drawn to a subject that seemed to his friends about as promising as the plague: a union dispute in a pyjama factory in the midwest.\par \par \uc2 Abbott based his script on a novel called 7 1/2 Cents by Richard Bissell, who had worked as a manager in the family's pyjama factory in Dubuque, Ohio. The story followed the progress of an ambitious young man from Chicago called Sid Sorokin. Here's how Bissell describes the shop floor of the factory:\par \par \uc2 It is mighty cheerful in a garment plant going wide open. The lights are bright and the sewing machines are working out themes by Stravinsky; it's warm and lively; the blonde table tops gleam; the needles are punching their way to glory 4,500 stitches a minute. Telephones are ringing, the elevator gate is banging, voices are raised and the whole room is filled with women, all shapes and sizes, fat, thin, possible, impossible, goofy, semi-goofy, happy, sad, bouncing brunette, silver threads among the gold, slap-happy bobby sock kids, old grousers with eight kids, and then the queens, always about two or three queens on each floor.\par \par \uc2 And here's how he describes Sid - unhappy in his new job - when he comes to the town in which the novel is set:\par \par \uc2 When I woke up in the morning, even before I had my eyes open, I knew I wasn't in Chicago any more. No, not in Chicago, or South Chicago either, or in Gary or Hammond. These small towns smell different entirely . . . Life, as the man says, is funny. One day you are in Gary High School practising clarinet cadenzas for the orchestra and trying to get a date for the dance with Marie Kowalski of the beautiful dark eyes, and the next thing you know you're standing in a foreign state looking at a window at some crummy old pump factory.\par \par \uc2 Bissell's writing is acerbic, dry and droll - the thriller writer, Elmore Leonard, cited him as an influence: "He wasn't trying to be funny. That was the main point. I thought that's the way to do it."\par \par \uc2 If Bissell was the inspiration for The Pajama Game, its godfather was unquestionably Frank Loesser, the composer and lyricist of Guys and Dolls and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Loesser worked in the Brill Building, the New York song factory at 1650 Broadway, where scores of songwriters, music publishers and song pluggers had their offices. In 1950 he brought together two young songwriters who were also working in the Brill Building - Richard Adler and Jerry Ross - and became their publisher and mentor. They were an improbable combination - Adler the son of a concert pianist and a debutante from Alabama; Ross the son of Russian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and former child-star of the Yiddish theatre. Encouraged by Loesser, Adler and Ross started to write for the theatre. Their first effort was an unsuccessful revue, but with their second collaboration, The Pajama Game, they hit gold. Their next show, Damn \uc2 Yankees\uc2 , opened the following year and had a similar success, but soon after Jerry Ross died of a lung disease at the age of 29.\par \par \uc2 I was unaware that Loesser, probably at the behest of his friend Abbot, had written two of the best songs in The Pajama Game - "There Once Was a Man" and "A New Town Is a Blue Town" - without receiving a credit. I'd like to think it was Loesser who was responsible for suggesting that the choreographer should be a young dancer called Bob Fosse, if only because Fosse later returned the favour by saying: "Guys and Dolls is the greatest American musical of all time." True, of course.\par \par \uc2 But it was actually Abbott who was Fosse's champion. With the confidence of a man who had no need to worry about his reputation, he consistently championed newcomers. When he was working on Me and Juliet with actress Joan McCracken, she asked him to consider Fosse as choreographer of The Pajama Game. She told Abbott that he was very young, very ambitious, and very talented - oh, and she was married to him. Fosse was then 25, on his second marriage, a dancer who had tried to match the early Fred Astaire by working in cabaret as a double act with his first wife, and had then gone to Hollywood to become a director. Instead he had become a frustrated contract player for MGM and had been cast in a small part in the film of Kiss Me Kate. The choreographer for that was Hermes Pan - Astaire's choreographer - who was persuaded by Fosse to let him do his own choreography for a number that he performed in the film with Carol Haney - later cast as Gladys in The Pajama Game.\par \par \uc2 Abbott was impressed by Fosse and was ready to give him the job, but one of his fledgling producers - a young ex\u8209\'20\'11stage manager called Hal Prince - needed convincing: "How do we know he can do a Broadway show?" he asked, "He's never done one." It was agreed that, as a backup, Abbott would ask Jerome Robbins to stand by in case things went wrong with Fosse. Robbins, although only 35, had choreographed at least four shows with Abbott and was the crowned king of Broadway dance. He extracted punitive conditions at Fosse's expensive for being his understudy - a handsome royalty and a credit as co-director. "What do I care about the credit," said Fosse, "People will know that I did it."\par \par \uc2 Fosse's routine for "Steam Heat" - Carol Haney's number - had all the hallmarks of what became his signature style: bowler hats, rolled shoulders, turned in knees and sharply sexy gestures. Although what he did was borrowed from many sources - the cakewalk, burlesque, vaudeville, Jack Cole (the father of "jazz dancing"), Pan and Astaire - the way he put it all together was unmistakably his own. When the show was in previews Abbot wanted to cut "Steam Heat" because he thought it slowed down the narrative. If Robbins made a single contribution to the show it's that he persuaded Abbott to leave the number in.\par \par \uc2 The show opened on 13 May 1954 at the St James theatre on Broadway. It ran for three years and won countless awards. Apart from Carol Haney as Gladys, Janis Page played Babe, John Raitt was Sid, Eddie Foy Jnr was Hines and Haney's understudy was a young actress called Shirley MacLaine.\par \par \uc2 In her memoir, Sage-ing While Age\u8209\'20\'11ing, MacLaine tells this story:\par \par \uc2 They gave me the understudy job, but I never had a rehearsal. I had thought Carol would go on with a broken neck. Then a few nights later, Carol sprained her ankle . . . When I arrived at the St James, across the stage door stood Jerry Robbins, Bob Fosse, Hal Prince, etc. "Haney is out," they said. "You're on." I couldn't believe what I was hearing. "I'm on? Without a rehearsal?"\par \par \uc2 There I was, waiting in the wings, when the announcer said Carol Haney would be out and I would replace her. There were boos from the orchestra to the second balcony . . . I did drop the hat in "Steam Heat". I lost it in midair, and said, "Oh shit," right out loud. The first few rows gasped and crossed their legs, but I got through the rest of it without falling into the pit. When the show was over, I took my bows with the other two "Steam Heat" dancers. The audience stood up. Buzz Miller and Peter Gennaro peeled off and left me in the centre of the stage to bask in the audience's appreciation.\par \par \uc2 MacLaine rang her brother, Warren Beatty, and told him to get some people over because she was on. That's how the movie producer, Hal B Wallis, came to be in the audience that night. He signed her on the spot to \uc2 Paramount Pictures\uc2  for a five year contract.\par \par \uc2 MacLaine didn't, sadly, appear in the lacklustre film of the show that was made three years later. Doris Day, who was then top of the charts with Sammy Fain's "Secret Love", was cast as Babe.\par \par \uc2 In the mid-50s the songs you'd hear in the theatre were the ones you'd hear sung in the street or on the radio. Rosemary Clooney's version of "Hey There" was at No 1 in the US charts for several weeks, while Archie Bleyer's cover of "Hernando's Hideaway" was at No 2, and Patti Page's "Steam Heat" at No 9. With the arrival of rock'n'roll that easy transfer from musicals to the hit parade started to dissolve and so did the book musical: the new music couldn't carry narrative and character. What's more, the implacable optimism that underwrote the Broadway musical for three or four decades withered in the face of the growing awareness that the US was engaged in a major war in a far away country in Asia, which was causing increasing numbers of soldiers to be sent home in coffins.\par \par \uc2 The Pajama Game opened in London at the Coliseum on 13 October 1955 and ran for a year and a half. Unlike many of the Broadway transfers of the period it didn't import American stars. Joy Nichols and Edmund Hockridge, Australian and Canadian respectively, led a company that also starred the comedian Max Wall as Hines and a young dancer called Elizabeth Seal in Shirley MacLaine's part. It did the trick for her too: she became famous overnight.\par \par \uc2 The Pajama Game runs at Shaftesbury theatre, London WC2, until 13 September. shaftesburytheatre.com.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 The Pajama Game at the Shaftesbury theatre.

They pointed a gun at his head, put him in a car, sat on him and drove to the airport.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 British police say that \u8216\'20\'18Skitz\u8217\'20\'19 was snared on suspicion of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  offences in Cyprus and later deported by Turkish Cypriot authorities.\par \par \uc2 They had offered a \u163\'00\'A310,000 reward for his capture.\par \par \uc2 British officers arrested him at Heathrow Airport after he was flown back in March 2013.\par \par \uc2 Anslow Snr, who now lives in Wimbledon, revealed his son\u8217\'20\'19s legal appeal after a visit to see the Triple Category A prisoner in jail.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf there is any justice, he should get the sentence halved, at the very least,\u8221\'20\'1D the 59-year-old said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYes, he\u8217\'20\'19s dabbled in drugs, but not to the extent that\u8217\'20\'19s been said. My son\u8217\'20\'19s no angel \u8211\'20\'13 far from it \u8211\'20\'13 but he\u8217\'20\'19s not what they\u8217\'20\'19ve made him out to be.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s been trial by media.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Anslow Snr maintains the vast majority of his son\u8217\'20\'19s wealth came from elaborate gambling scams, carried out at race tracks and casinos.\par \par \uc2 But Anslow did deal in drugs, his dad admitted, while holding down a full-time job at a plumbers\u8217\'20\'19 firm.\par \par \uc2 Perks of his job included a company car, now one of a string of motors in Anslow\u8217\'20\'19s possession \u8211\'20\'13 the fleet including a \u163\'00\'A355,000 Porsche.\par \par \uc2 But claims that Anslow was a mere minnow in the illicit drugs trade are not borne out by information and evidence gathered by the police.\par \par \uc2 A bug in his Bradley flat revealed a far-reaching narcotics network. A subsequent raid uncovered a Rolex watch and tell-tale signs of a luxury lifestyle funded by thousands of pounds of cocaine and cannabis.\par \par \uc2 From Anslow\u8217\'20\'19s Tipton manor, large quantities of drugs were distributed nationally.\par \par \uc2 And it was Richard Deakin\u8217\'20\'19s killer, David Harrison, who acted as partner in the illicit operation.\par \par \uc2 The Woolwich Crown Court trial took its toll on Anslow, his father said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is the best I\u8217\'20\'19ve seen him,\u8221\'20\'1D he told the Sunday Mercury.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHe was looking haggard before. It\u8217\'20\'19s a weight off his shoulders.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Breaking out of Hewell may have been a \u8220\'20\'1Cgood thing in a bad way\u8221\'20\'1D claimed Anslow Snr.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt meant his trial was at Woolwich, not Stafford, which was fairer,\u8221\'20\'1D he explained.\par \par \uc2 Other members of the Anslow clan are less supportive of the breakout.\par \par \uc2 One said: \u8220\'20\'1CThat was wrong. That was the start of everything. Then they had to make an example.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A member of prison staff has been sacked following the escape and others disciplined for failing to detect a mobile phone Anslow had secreted in an intimate part of his anatomy.\par \par \uc2 In all, six people have been jailed for their part in the plot to spring Anslow.\par \par \uc2 After undergoing two security searches at Belmarsh, Anslow Snr said was only allowed to speak to his son through a glass wall, with guards and a dog close by.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think it\u8217\'20\'19s barbaric,\u8221\'20\'1D he added. \u8220\'20\'1CYou can\u8217\'20\'19t have a conversation and, remember, he\u8217\'20\'19s got three young kids who want to visit him.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Last night a relative voiced concern over how Anslow will cope with a three-decade prison tern.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CJohn will miss his children the most,\u8221\'20\'1D the Sunday Mercury was told. \u8220\'20\'1CHe has a lot of time for his children, I can\u8217\'20\'19t take that away from him.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen you have that many years hanging over you, I don\u8217\'20\'19t know how that will affect him.

They then go to war on the front line, dreaming of heroism.\par \par \uc2 At least 20 Brits have been killed in battle \u8212\'20\'14 a number that rose on Thursday when the \uc2 Foreign and Commonwealth Office\uc2  announced it was investigating claims two Britons \u8212\'20\'14 Abu Abdullah al-Biritani and Abu Jibril al-Biritani \u8212\'20\'14 had died during bitter in-fighting between terrorist factions.\par \par \uc2 But with martyrdom seen as a \u8220\'20\'1Cfast track to heaven" by radicalised fighters, death is no deterrent.\par \par \uc2 Worringly, those British fighters who survive can return to the UK on an open passport.\par \par \uc2 These \u8220\'20\'1Cterrorism tourists" are security chiefs\u8217\'20\'19 worst nightmare \u8212\'20\'14 radicalised, combat-trained jihadists who will come back to our shores brimming with hate.\par \par \uc2 And in a chilling interview with The Sun, a top anti-terror cop says this is a \u8220\'20\'1Cvery grave threat to national security" that could lead to attacks on British soil.\par \par \uc2 Three of Abubaker Deghayes\u8217\'20\'19 four sons have joined the jihad in Syria \u8212\'20\'14 and in April, one was killed.\par \par \uc2 Amer, now 20, was the first to go, in October last year. He was joined there by brothers Jaffar, 16, and Abdullah, 18 when he died.\par \par \uc2 Their father Abubaker, 45, who lives in Saltdean near Brighton, says: \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t know what we could have done to stop them going. They went of their own free will and without our consent.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI travelled to Turkey to meet Abdullah and Jaffar, to try to stop them... but they were stubborn about travelling to Syria after seeing videos of atrocities online.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe believe Amer has been injured. We are all grieving.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMy sons are not terrorists but travelled to Syria to defend those who are weak. Of course I think that my son is a martyr. Anyone who dies for a just cause is."\par \par \uc2 Abdullah\u8217\'20\'19s mother Einas Abulsaye claims her son was an ordinary boy with a bright future until the dark cloud of extremism came over him.\par \par \uc2 She told the BBC: \u8220\'20\'1CMy son was a very naive, very helpful, brave boy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHe did not tell me before he left for Syria. His brother Jaffar said they needed their passports for ID at school. You can\u8217\'20\'19t say my sons are terrorists. When he left home, he asked for a cuddle. I had no idea it would be his last."\par \par \uc2 Abdullah\u8217\'20\'19s sister Aisha, 21, adds: \u8220\'20\'1CI spoke to all three after they left, telling them to come back. It\u8217\'20\'19s hard to sleep knowing your brothers are in the middle of a war zone."\par \par \uc2 So many young Muslims from around the world are joining the \u8220\'20\'1Choly war" in Syria that they have been dubbed \u8220\'20\'1CGeneration Jihad".\par \par \uc2 All too often, these \u8220\'20\'1Cterrorism tourists" end up dead.\par \par \uc2 Last December Ifthekar Jaman, 23, died in a clash in Syria. Born and educated in Portsmouth, he fell under the spell of Anwar al-Awlaki, an \uc2 al-Qaeda\uc2  recruiter described as \u8220\'20\'1Cthe Bin Laden of the internet".\par \par \uc2 Last May, Jaman slipped into Syria and joined terrorist group ISIS, which has links to \uc2 al-Qaeda\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Via Tumblr and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , Jaman bragged that he was ready to die \u8220\'20\'1Ca martyr" and urged others to join his quest for \u8220\'20\'1Ceternal paradise".\par \par \uc2 On Tumblr, he wrote: \u8220\'20\'1CWhat is it like to hold a gun? Ha, ha, honestly? It feels so cool!" He was killed soon after. Last summer, Akram Sebah, 24, a north London estate agent, and his brother Mohamed, 28, a maths tutor, were also killed in Syria.\par \par \uc2 Radical internet preachers made them poster-boys for the jihad, dubbing them \u8220\'20\'1Cthe British Lions".\par \par \uc2 Both went to Syria without their father\u8217\'20\'19s knowledge.\par \par \uc2 Their dad Abdulrahman Sebah, 62, says: \u8220\'20\'1CNo father or mother wishes their children to go to hell or to whatever you call Syria. If someone goes, they don\u8217\'20\'19t come back."\par \par \uc2 Scores of young British Muslims are in the now warzone, and using \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to convince other Brits to follow.\par \par \uc2 One \u8212\'20\'14 calling himself @GuiltyMuslim \u8212\'20\'14 uses images of maimed children and stomach-churning videos of men being beaten to death, allegedly by Assad loyalists, to hawk for donations that go straight into \uc2 al-Qaeda\uc2  coffers.\par \par \uc2 Another, Abu Maryam Englizee, shows off piles of guns and grenades while bragging: \u8220\'20\'1CJihad is my happiness. How can I thank Allah for what he has given me."\par \par \uc2 Scandalously, he tries to provoke other British Muslims into action by saying: \u8220\'20\'1CThose who stay back because of their family are a thousand times wrong."\par \par \uc2 The biggest fear is that these battle-hardened, brainwashed jihadists will return to wreak havoc in the UK \u8212\'20\'14 something one top anti-terror cop calls a \u8220\'20\'1Cvery grave threat".\par \par \uc2 Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball, the Met\u8217\'20\'19s senior national coordinator for counter terrorism, says: \u8220\'20\'1CWe are taking this extremely seriously.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is definitely an increase in young British people going to Syria. Some arrive with the best of intentions but they can end up fighting for a terrorist organisation very easily.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe fear some will return \u8212\'20\'14 they may have been radicalised and persuaded to carry out attacks.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAn enormous amount of police and intelligence agency resource is going into preventing anything that would be a risk to public safety.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe have units that can monitor anything that is extremist.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are alert to radicalisation as well. If we believe individuals who have been trained to fight are returning to the UK, then they will be arrested."\par \par \uc2 But Shaista Gohir, of the Muslim Women\u8217\'20\'19s Network, thinks the problem is far bigger than police admit.\par \par \uc2 She says: \u8220\'20\'1CPolice officially say a few hundred young men and a handful of women from the UK have joined the fighting in Syria, but in my experience of talking to the families, there are many more.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMany of these young men live their lives online and are watching videos of people being beheaded and children killed.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey are told, \u8216\'20\'18If you are a man, you would join us and help this holy war\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen they come back they will be dangerous, with extreme views they may try to spread, inciting violence here in the UK."\par \par \uc2 When Birmingham mother Mukhtar Nazir, 42, learned that her sons, aged 18 and 16, were being targeted by British jihadists in Syria via \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , she intervened \u8212\'20\'14 and she is urging other British Muslim mums to do the same.\par \par \uc2 She says: \u8220\'20\'1CI looked at my elder son\u8217\'20\'19s phone and he is getting regular \uc2 Twitter\uc2  messages from young men from the UK in Syria. It has become an underground cult.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThese messages and pictures horrify me. They glorify death and martyrdom. I think most of the young men who go are looking to die \u8212\'20\'14 they do not expect to return.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is a brotherhood. We are keen to live in peace but I sense a restlessness, especially in my older boy. He is becoming more remote."\par \par \uc2 Mukhtar joined women\u8217\'20\'19s group Jihad Against Violence, which aims to reclaim Islam from extremists.\par \par \uc2 She says: \u8220\'20\'1CI talk to my sons and hope they listen. I can only pray that one morning I will not find their beds empty and they have gone to die in Syria."\par \par \uc2 'We're as appalled as you' \u8220\'20\'1COUR moderate community is horrified at what is happening and we are very worried," says Dr Basharat Nazir, a spokesman for the moderate Ahmadiyya Muslim Association.\par \par \uc2 Based at the Baitul Futuh Mosque in Morden, south London, the group aims its teachings at young Muslims.\par \par \uc2 Dr Nazir says: \u8220\'20\'1CIt does not make sense to go to Syria and fight someone else\u8217\'20\'19s fight in the name of Islam.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI have watched some of the videos posted by British youths in Syria and they are spreading like a virus.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey get into the mindset of young people.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn the old days, hate and radicalism were spread by preachers in mosques \u8211\'20\'13 now they are spread on the internet.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMy group of Muslims are dedicated to peace \u8211\'20\'13 but there are many other vulnerable young minds out there.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThen, when these men return, they will spread these seeds of violence and it could take a generation to heal.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey are glamorising this life of violence, inciting others to fight. The trouble is that a lot of Muslim youngsters in Britain today are not in active or satisfying jobs.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey live lives of idleness and this is seen as a chance to prove themselves.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe radicalism stems from a misunderstanding of Islam. In Britain we now have large \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from Pakistan and they bring with them a misunderstanding about jihad.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe same thing is happening in Nigeria.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSometimes the message of hate is spread through imams at the mosques or scholars from other countries coming here to speak at conferences and workshops, inciting young people to go to Syria."\par \par \uc2 Document THESCOT020140510ea5a000xe\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15
