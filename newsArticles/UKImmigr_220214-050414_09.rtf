\par\par \uc2 TRAVEL\par \b \uc2 Napa and Sonoma: touring California's winelands; In California's Napa and Sonoma, the Silicon Valley set goes to play in a land of fine wine, boutique hotels and great American restaurants\b0\par\par\uc2 Sasha Abramsky   \par \uc2 2,930 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 08:30\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 "I view it as a sort of miracle," said Sir Peter Michael on the phone, when I asked him about the landscape surrounding his winery in Knights Valley, northern California. \u8220\'20\'1CYou sit with a glass of wine in hand, looking at the sunset. It is absolutely stunning territory."\par \par \uc2 Days later, as my claret Nissan Altima hybrid \u8211\'20\'13 a fashionable choice, as I was soon to learn \u8211\'20\'13 came gliding to a halt in the parking area, I could see what he meant. His main office is a white shingle-and-timber building with a charming little bell tower poking up into a brilliant blue sky. Mount St Helena soars above deep-green foothills ribbed with vines and, on hot days, eagles can be seen turning tight circles in the thermal currents.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19d imagined this area of Sonoma County, an hour\u8217\'20\'19s drive north-east of San Francisco, to be familiar and somewhat tame, a subtler twin to Napa County, with its faux chateaux and coachloads of wine tourists. But there is nothing tame about Sonoma. Wild and beautiful, it recalls the paintings of Gregory Kondos, with their sun-browned valleys, curvaceous hills and expanses of water in exuberant Mediterranean blues. Deer congregate near the huge solar panels that provide the estate\u8217\'20\'19s energy. And, where deer hang out, fearsome mountain lions hunt. Brown bears are also known to frequent these hills, as do skunks, possums and coyotes \u8211\'20\'13 a who\u8217\'20\'19s who of the wildlife headliners of the great American West.\par \par \uc2 Sir Peter Michael is something of a headliner himself and, like California\u8217\'20\'19s natural wonders, is larger than life. A British technology venture capitalist, he discovered the beauty of Sonoma-Napa in 1972 on weekend trips north from the California headquarters of his Quantel high-tech company. In the early 1980s, he bought hundreds of acres and planted vines on what was originally cattle-ranching land on the Sonoma side of the mountains. His aim was to create a world-class winery and a family retreat for generations of Michaels to come. In both, he succeeded.\par \par \uc2 Back in England, his legacy is The Vineyard, a five-star hotel with an exceptional collection of Californian wines. They come not only from the Peter Michael Winery but also from a select group of suppliers including Schramsberg, world-famous for its sparkling wines, Charles Heintz, Honig and Rudd. Most of these estates are open for tastings, though often by appointment only. Together, the wines in Sir Peter\u8217\'20\'19s cellars represent the cutting edge of Californian winemaking.\par \par \uc2 With The Vineyard as my unofficial wine concierge, I set off on a three-day trip with a friend to experience the very best of the region\u8217\'20\'19s wine, food and lodgings. Starting from Sacramento, where I have lived for the past decade, we headed south-west through Davis, Dixon and Vacaville to Fairfield. The colours became more extreme as we left the I-80, one of America\u8217\'20\'19s great cross-country roads, and drove west to the town of Napa itself. In late spring, the burned grass of the hillsides was as golden-brown as a Van Gogh haystack, while the green trees and vines took on ever-deeper hues.\par \par \uc2 The noises of urban life began to dissipate. It was an absence of sound that first struck me when we stopped for a capuccino at the Small World Cafe in Napa. In the window were dozens of model vintage cars, of the throaty sports and supercar variety. By contrast, many of the vehicles on the streets were muted. The Prius hybrid is the best-selling car in California these days \u8211\'20\'13 and the higher an area\u8217\'20\'19s income, the more eco-friendly the traffic. In Napa, the Tesla electric car is more of a status symbol than a Rolls-Royce, cruising silently past the salons and upscale clothing stores, the Quent Condair Fine Art gallery and Joey\u8217\'20\'19s Bakery, with its delightful cakes.\par \par \uc2 Half an hour after finishing our coffees, we were deep in wine country. Napa County has just four per cent of California\u8217\'20\'19s wine-producing acreage, but it accounts for a third of the dollars generated by wine sales. Sonoma County is larger and its vineyards grow a wider variety of grapes. The scenery is more dramatic, the hills higher. There is a sense of menace, almost, to some of its densely wooded slopes. Where Napa\u8217\'20\'19s broad valleys are sun-drenched, Sonoma\u8217\'20\'19s are hemmed in by high hills. It is a mountain-biker\u8217\'20\'19s paradise.\par \par \uc2 Most visitors come to Sonoma-Napa not for the adventure sports but to eat in some of America\u8217\'20\'19s finest restaurants, including The French Laundry in Yountville, where reservations have to be made months in advance. More accessible are the Michelin-starred restaurant at the Auberge du Soleil resort, and Morimoto Napa, in the town of Napa itself, serving the delicate sushi creations of the chef and television star \uc2 Masaharu Morimoto\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Fine restaurants require fine wines, which the Peter Michael Winery has been happy to supply. Virtually every Michelin-starred restaurant in America stocks the vineyard\u8217\'20\'19s cabernets, says sales manager Peter Kay, including the signature Les Pavots, and several stock its pinot noirs and chardonnays, too.\par \par \uc2 That success is due to an extraordinary attention to terroir. Sir Peter\u8217\'20\'19s team measures variations in the mineral content of the volcanic soil, and the moisture, sunlight and wind to which different parts of his land are exposed, then plants the grapes accordingly. In Sonoma County, famous for its micro-climates, planting a couple of thousand feet apart can result in very different conditions.\par \par \uc2 The result is a set of superior wines, with delicate variations in texture and huge aromatic shifts from label to label. One can practically smell, touch and taste the earth\u8217\'20\'19s varying qualities in each glass. Over lunch at the winery, Peter Kay chose wines to match our food. The first course, scallops, was accompanied by a La Carriere chardonnay. The second course, wild boar terrine, came with a glass of Ma Danseuse pinot noir, made from grapes grown on the estate\u8217\'20\'19s Ma Danseuse vineyard. Sir Peter named it as a love note to his wife, Maggie, whom he met at a dance school in Croydon in the late 1950s.\par \par \uc2 In the 1976 Judgment of Paris \u8211\'20\'13 a one-off blind tasting competition organised by a British wine merchant \u8211\'20\'13 California chardonnays and cabernet sauvignons ran away with the top prizes, proving to the world that Californian wine had arrived. That was the year that Sir Peter, entertaining business associates at the Fairmont San Francisco hotel, tasted a top-end \uc2 Chateau Montelena\uc2  from Napa and was hooked. Yet even today, relatively few Californian wines are sold in Britain \u8211\'20\'13 something the pioneering winemaker is keen to change. \u8220\'20\'1CWine," he insists, \u8220\'20\'1Cis social networking for civilised people; it is \uc2 Facebook\uc2  for those who want to have a life. The story begins in the vineyard, and after the bottle is opened, people tell their friends. The two greatest products to come out of the Golden State are technology and wine."\par \par \uc2 Our next stop was Schramsberg, the second-oldest winery in California. Situated just over the hills, on the Napa County side of the mountains, it is set in a landscape of lily ponds and has a fascinating history. In 1862 Jacob Schramsberg, a German \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , planted a vineyard up in the hills. A few years later he hired unemployed Chinese labourers, left stranded by the completion of the transcontinental railroad, to hand-dig a series of caves through the hillsides, in which to store his wines.\par \par \uc2 Fast forward 150 years and those caves, in which the pick-marks of those labourers can still be seen, have been expanded. Inside are 2.7 million bottles of top-notch cabernet sauvignons as well as some of California\u8217\'20\'19s best sparkling wines: an oenologist\u8217\'20\'19s Fort Knox. One sparkling wine, the 2005 JSchram ($210/\u163\'00\'A3130) was listed by the American Robb Report magazine as one of the top 18 wines in the world.\par \par \uc2 Since 1972, when President Nixon took several cases to China on his breakthrough visit to meet Chairman Mao, the brand has been a White House favourite. The Prince and Princess of Wales drank Schramsberg with Ronald Reagan in 1985; Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh shared a Brut Ros\u233\'00\'E9 with George W Bush in 2007; and the Obamas have served Schramsberg at a number of state functions.\par \par \uc2 Having sampled a few of the wines myself, I spent the night at Auberge du Soleil in the hills above the little Napa town of Rutherford. Its rooms, in adobe bungalow style, are scattered up the hillside; its landscaped gardens, planted with semi-tropical flowers, are dotted with metal sculptures placed discreetly among the trees and shrubs.\par \par \uc2 One thing you notice in Napa County is an obsessive attention to detail, with an emphasis on absolute numerical precision \u8211\'20\'13 as befits a wineland so intertwined with the fortunes of high-tech high-flyers. At Auberge du Soleil, the pool is maintained at exactly 27 degrees. In the acclaimed restaurant, presided over by chef Robert Curry, $175 gets you an ounce, to the dot, of caviar.\par \par \uc2 My dinner there comprised lobster, a shot glass full of creamy fennel soup, halibut, squab (with a far from local Chteauneuf du Pape), steak pav\u233\'00\'E9 the rich purple of a Roman imperial toga, and dainty chocolate dumplings encircled by vanilla ice cream and drizzled with olive oil.\par \par \uc2 The great Californian essayist Joan Didion once wrote that \u8220\'20\'1Cgreat hotels have always been social ideas, flawless mirrors to the particular societies they service". Auberge du Soleil\u8217\'20\'19s society is the \uc2 Google\uc2 -and-\uc2 Facebook\uc2  crowd \u8211\'20\'13 wealthy but casual, as reluctant to turn up for a $500 dinner in a jacket and tie as to show up driving a Rolls-Royce. They wear jeans and drive Subarus or Teslas, and they expect to be given a wine menu on an iPad, not on printed paper. At Auberge, they are not disappointed.\par \par \uc2 Next day we visited the Rudd estate, owned by the family behind the \uc2 Dean&DeLuca\uc2  deli chain. Its entrance is formal, wood-panelled and old-worldly, but underground all is modern. The cellars are antiseptically clean, lined with concrete and containing smooth, giant concrete eggs in which some of the wines are fermented. Visitors pay $80 for a food-and-wine tasting that often includes produce from the Rudds\u8217\'20\'19 own gardens. In those gardens stand eight ancient olive trees, each brought by helicopter from Humboldt County, 200 miles away.\par \par \uc2 Rudd produces a terrific set of reds, including the noted Rudd Oakville Estate Red, but my favourite was Samantha\u8217\'20\'19s Cabernet Sauvignon, named after proprietor \uc2 Leslie Rudd\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s daughter. Having just been shown around the estate by Samantha, it seemed only polite to have a drink in her honour.\par \par \uc2 The final winery on my list was the Honig estate, a casual, family-run affair noted for its environmental sustainability. The Honigs don\u8217\'20\'19t use fertilisers or pesticides, and instead rely heavily on bringing in birds to eat pests that threaten the vines. In German, Honig means honey \u8211\'20\'13 hence the bee logo on the estate\u8217\'20\'19s bottles. My favourite here was a dessert wine made from sauvigon blanc grapes, grown near the Napa River and affected by the botrytis fungus which lends the wine a delicious honeysuckle flavour. It would be the perfect partner to foie gras, said winemaker Stephanie Honig, our host.\par \par \uc2 On our final evening in Napa County, we stopped in the town of St Helena. It was far too hot to go hiking in the hills, too hot even to stroll through town. We passed half an hour sampling olive oils out of shot glasses at Long Meadow Ranch, including the pricey but delicious Prato Lungo, made from olives grown on ancient trees and, with its peppery kick, ideal for dipping bread in before dinner.\par \par \uc2 That took place at Solbar, the Michelin-starred restaurant at Solage Calistoga. They seated us outside, next to a long fire pit and opposite an Olympic-size pool ringed by palm trees. I ordered salad followed by duck confit, with yet another fine local cabernet. Dessert was an over-the-top bread pudding, with a dolphin-shaped scoop of vanilla ice cream and an apple crisp on top.\par \par \uc2 My friend looked up. \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s Joe Montana," he said quietly. And it was. There at the table next to us was America\u8217\'20\'19s most famous footballer. We raised our glasses and toasted wine country. It was time to head back to the real world.\par \par \uc2 How to live the Californian dream\par \par \uc2 Where to taste\par \par \uc2 Honig, Rutherford: The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.honigwine.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 winery }}}\uc2  is famous for its environmental ethos: solar panels, bluebirds (which eat destructive insects) and barn owls (which eat gophers), rather than herbicides or pesticides. Tours are by appointment only and cost $15/\u163\'00\'A39.20 per person, waived with every $35/\u163\'00\'A321 purchase.\par \par \uc2 Peter Michael Winery, Knights Valley: Specialises in cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays, using grapes from the on-site vineyards, as well as two other properties owned by Sir Peter Michael. Tours are by appointment only and will be personalised by James Hocking, director of wine for The Vineyard Group.

For example in \u173\'00\'ADOctober, Will Straw, director of the Institute for Policy Research think-tank was interviewed about Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s pledge to freeze energy prices for two years.\par \par \uc2 The think-tank was described as \u8220\'20\'1Ccentre left" but it was not disclosed Mr Straw was a Labour parliamentary candidate, even when Labour policy was discussed.\par \par \uc2 A report by BBC News in July quoted \u8220\'20\'1Cuniversity think-tank" Million\u8217\'20\'19s assertion that England was facing a shortage of teachers without saying the think tank is run and staffed almost exclusively by Labour insiders.\par \par \uc2 On March 19, Today failed to point out the Resolution Foundation is a centre-Left think-tank, though it made clear that Policy Exchange is right of centre.\par \par \uc2 Last year BBC political editor Nick Robinson admitted the BBC had made a \u8220\'20\'1Cterrible mistake" by not reflecting public concern about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  during Blair\u8217\'20\'19s years.\par \par \uc2 Last night Phil Davies MP said: \u8220\'20\'1CThere is without a doubt an institutional left-wing bias at the BBC. I don\u8217\'20\'19t say it is always deliberate. The problem is there are so many like-minded people in the organisation who don\u8217\'20\'19t see there is any challenge to the way their metropolitan, metrosexual view of the world.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey need to get out more and mix with the ordinary \u173\'00\'ADpeople outside of their middle-class, champagne-socialist circles. As long as the law exists that forces us all to pay for the BBC from our taxes, it is going to have to do a damned sight better at being impartial.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn my opinion the licence fee must be replaced by a voluntary subscription service."\par \par \uc2 A recent report on BBC bias by the right-of-centre \uc2 Centre for Policy Studies\uc2  found only one centre left think-tank received a \u8220\'20\'1Chealth warning" more than once in every 10 times it was mentioned while right-wing think- tanks were introduced that way one in four mentions.\par \par \uc2 Director Tim Knox said: \u8220\'20\'1CWe are very concerned that there is a left bias within the BBC."\par \par \uc2 Former BBC journalist David Keighley now runs Newswatch, and has monitored BBC bias towards the EU for more than 15 years. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat we have found is a systematic under-representation of the case for withdrawing from the EU," he said.\par \par \uc2 Last night a BBC spokesman said: \u8220\'20\'1CBBC News provides impartial and independent coverage across all outlets and we have a responsibility to report a range of different viewpoints."\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140309ea39002be\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Voices\par \b \uc2 The Camerons' nanny isn't the scandal here... The whole subject of domestic work is beset by prejudices about class, race and gender\b0\par\par\uc2 Joan Smith   \par \uc2 536 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 13:54\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 I can't say I care much whether David and Samantha Cameron employ a nanny. Gina Lima has been with the couple for several years, arriving when they needed help with their disabled son, Ivan, and staying on after he died in 2009. The length of time she's worked for the family suggests they have a good relationship, and I'd be astonished if she wasn't paid properly or given sufficient time off.\par \par \uc2 There is a scandal about domestic workers in this country but the case of the Camerons' nanny isn't it. Lima, who is from Nepal but became a British citizen in 2010, apparently joined the family via an organisation called Kalayaan, which helps migrant workers escape abusive employers. It's based in Notting Hill, where the Prime Minister has his London home, and its website describes the exploitation \u8211\'20\'13 physical, psychological and sexual abuse, low pay and long hours \u8211\'20\'13 suffered by many workers.\par \par \uc2 I'm sure Lima is finding public discussion of her circumstances uncomfortable but she isn't the only domestic worker \u8211\'20\'13 nor are the Camerons the only employers \u8211\'20\'13 to come under scrutiny. Nick Clegg's discomfort with the subject was evident on his LBC phone-in. "I have a lady who has a Belgian passport who helps us," he observed awkwardly. Two more ministers were dragged in yesterday: it was "revealed" that the Home Secretary, Theresa May, has a Brazilian cleaner who now has British citizenship, while the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, employs a Portuguese cleaner.\par \par \uc2 As my colleague John Rentoul notes today, the current row was sparked by a sentence in a speech by the new \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, James Brokenshire. But it's a ritual that plays out periodically on both sides of the Atlantic, targeting not just politicians who have unknowingly employed an illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  (as Brokenshire's predecessor, Mark Harper, did) but those who have hired foreigners perfectly legally. There isn't much public sympathy for either category, but that's because the whole subject of domestic work is so beset by prejudices about class, race and gender.\par \par \uc2 People who work in offices cleaned by minimum-wage migrants sneer at the Camerons or the Cleggs. The fact that most of this labour is done late at night means we don't think much about the people who do it \u8211\'20\'13 or their working conditions. I suspect Alexander's cleaner is treated better than most, but who cares when there's an opportunity for political point-scoring?\par \par \uc2 What's telling about these controversies is the outcome. A politician may be embarrassed, but it's the worker who risks most. In 2009, Labour's attorney general was revealed to have employed an illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  from Tonga as housekeeper. Lady Scotland, who earned more than \u163\'00\'A3100,000 a year, was fined \u163\'00\'A35,000 for failing to keep copies of relevant documents. Loloahi Tapui, who was paid the minimum wage of just over \u163\'00\'A36 per hour, was given eight months in prison and sent back to Tonga.\par \par \uc2 twitter.com/@polblonde; politicalblonde.com\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140309ea39002e5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NEWS\par \b \uc2 Nick Clegg sings Britain's praises; Nick Clegg praises Britain while warning freedom and tolerance are at risk from a tide of far-Right extremism\b0\par\par\uc2 By Matthew Holehouse Political Correspondent in York   \par \uc2 623 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 14:07\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg today sang a hymn of praise to Britain, including tea, the Shipping Forecast and football, as he warned freedom and tolerance are at risk from a tide of far-Right extremism which is sweeping Europe.\par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrats are the true party of patriots that will defend British values from a "dangerous" trend of hosility to foreigners.\par \par \uc2 He placed Ukip alongside Hungary's Jobbik and the French Front National, indicating Nigel Farage is the "acceptable face of blame" and his party offers "anger and bile".\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg wants to frame May's European elections as a straight fight between the two parties. It will be a contest of "Great Britain" versus "little England", he said.\par \par \uc2 "We are the guardians of a modern, open and tolerant Britain," Mr Clegg claimed.\par \par \uc2 In a speech that echoed John Mayor's paean to a country of warm beer and invicible green suburbs twenty years ago, Mr Clegg hailed the British traditions of queuing, wearing flip-flops in cold weather and satire as well as gay marriage and the rule of law.\par \par \uc2 He told the Liberal Democrat spring conference in York: "I love Britain."\par \par \uc2 "I love that a country capable of extraordinary pomp and ceremony can still retain a spiky irreverence towards its establishment. A country where we line the streets waving our Union Jacks wildly to welcome the arrival of Prince George, and the next moment we\u8217\'20\'19re chuckling at Private Eye's front page: 'Woman Has Baby\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 "I love that the shipping forecast is listened to by insomniacs of all ages, right across the country, miles from the sea. I love that we do respond to every problem no matter how big or small with the same thing: a cup of tea."\par \par \uc2 Globalisation and the rise of China has not brought the promised spread of democracy and liberal values and on the continent anti-semitic parties that regard foreigners as "filth" are winning support, he warned.\par \par \uc2 "This is our backyard. The forces of chauvinism, protectionism and xenophobia have been emboldened. And there is no doubt about it: the fight is now on for the future direction of our continent."\par \par \uc2 He stressed Britain was "lucky" to avoid such extremism but said an "ungenerous, backwards looking politics" is on the rise.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg did not identify Ukip or Mr Farage by name but aides said the speech was aimed squarely at them.\par \par \uc2 The two men will debate whether to withdraw from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  on TV next month.\par \par \uc2 "Ukip think they love Britain. There's nothing patriotic about putting jobs at risk," a senior Liberal Democrat source said.\par \par \uc2 Last week Nigel Farage hardened his party's anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  stance, claiming he travelled on trains in south London on which no-one spoke English.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg's address also follows \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's off-the-cuff defence of "big-hearted" Britain at the G20 summit in St Petersburg last year, after it was a dismissed by a Russian official as "just a small island".\par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrats have fought to take credit for the Coalition's tax cuts, but on Sunday Iain Duncan Smith, the Welfare Secretary, disputed Danny Alexander's claim the Tories had to be "forced" into raising the income tax threshold.\par \par \uc2 "That's not my recollection. If there was a row, it's the kind of row you have around a cup of tea at the breakfast table," Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg said he would not let the Liberal Democrat's role in Government be "air-brushed".\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140309ea3900462\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Comment\par \b \uc2 The evidence is clear: the Home Secretary and the Conservatives talk nonsense on \uc2 immigration\uc2 ; There appears to be little association between non-EU \uc2 immigration\uc2  and employment\b0\par\par\uc2 David Blanchflower   \par \uc2 1,051 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 16:00\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 This week the Coalition started to fight like ferrets in a sack over their failed migration policy. Ukip is likely to take advantage in the May European elections.\par \par \uc2 To say the Coalition is in a terrible muddle understates the disaster they have created for themselves as their \u8220\'20\'1Creducing net migration" policy has fallen apart. Infighting and finger-pointing have now ensued. It didn\u8217\'20\'19t help that the newly published migration data showed that David Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s promise to dramatically lower net migration had disastrously failed. The much-heralded downward trend in the early years of the Coalition has now reversed itself.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The latest Migration Statistics Quarterly Report, February 2014, reported a provisional estimated net flow of 212,000 long-term migrants to the UK in the year ending September 2013, a statistically significant increase from 154,000 in the previous year. The chart illustrates the time series pattern: during the 1960s and 1970s, there were more people emigrating from the UK than arriving to live in the UK. During the 1980s and early 1990s, net migration was positive at a relatively low level in the majority of years. Since 1994, it has been positive every year and rose sharply after 1997. During the 2000s, net migration peaked in 2004/05, in part as a result of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  of citizens from the Accession Countries that joined the EU in 2004. Since the peak, annual net migration has fluctuated between around 150,000 and 250,000.\par \par \uc2 The chart makes clear that despite falls in net migration in 2010 through 2012, the subsequent trend is up, in large part driven by the fact that fewer UK citizens are emigrating, presumably because Spain and other countries are less attractive than they were pre-recession. The Coalition didn\u8217\'20\'19t seem to realise it was going to be especially hard for it to control the number of Brits leaving, let alone the number of EU citizens arriving.\par \par \uc2 Net migration of EU citizens doubled from 65,000 in the year ending September 2012 to 131,000 in the year ending September 2013, which is a statistically significant increase. Conversely, the estimate of net migration of non-EU citizens has declined over the last few years. Although the recent fall to 141,000 in the year ending September 2013 from 160,000 in the previous year was not a statistically significant change, non-EU net migration remains at a lower level relative to the 2005 and 2010 peaks.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The Coalition recently lost their \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, Mark Harper, who was forced to stand down after he discovered his cleaner did not have permission to work in the UK. His replacement, James Brokenshire, last week delivered his first speech as \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  minister to almost universal condemnation, where he claimed that better-off families and big businesses had benefited most from the recent arrival of foreign workers in Britain. By contrast, he argued that \u8220\'20\'1Cordinary, hard-working people" have not felt the economic benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Vince Cable, in contrast, has made clear he is \u8220\'20\'1Cintensely relaxed" about mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , which lowers the price of goods to the benefit of all. So that\u8217\'20\'19s clear, then.\par \par \uc2 Then there was all that fuss started by Chris Cook on BBC2\u8217\'20\'19s Newsnight, who discovered that a report on the lack of displacement effects of migrants was being suppressed by Downing Street. It apparently showed a weaker link between \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and unemployment than the Government had claimed. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, claimed in 2012: \u8220\'20\'1CThere is a clear association between non-European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and employment in the UK. Between 1995 and 2010 \u8230\'20\'26 for every additional one hundred \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , [academics] estimated that 23 British workers would not be employed."\par \par \uc2 The basis for this contention was an earlier econometric study by the Government\u8217\'20\'19s independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), published in 2012, on the impact of migration on the employment of native British workers. It concluded, contrary to a number of other analyses, that there was, at least for some \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and in some circumstances, a negative impact. Matt Cavanagh, then at IPPR, and Jon Portes at NIESR were highly critical of the findings.\par \par \uc2 Lo and behold, the previously hidden report was suddenly published a couple of days later, and boy was it embarrassing for Dave and his Eton pals. It was written by two authors employed at the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills and three from the Home Office.*\par \par \uc2 The authors conclude that there is \u8220\'20\'1Crelatively little evidence that migration has caused significant displacement of UK natives \u8230\'20\'26 when the economy is strong." While it does find \u8220\'20\'1Cevidence of some labour market displacement, particularly by non-EU migrants in recent years when the economy was in recession", it adds this is a short-term effect, one that is \u8220\'20\'1Clikely to dissipate".\par \par \uc2 They further conclude that \u8220\'20\'1Cthere has been little evidence in the literature of a statistically significant impact from EU migration on native employment outcomes". Where displacement effects are observed, the authors found these tend to be concentrated on lower-skilled natives.\par \par \uc2 The authors of the Government\u8217\'20\'19s new study reworked the results obtained in the earlier MAC study and found that when data from part of the period of economic downturn (2009 and 2010) were omitted, the impact of non-EU migration was no longer statistically significant.\par \par \uc2 The finding that displacement impacts may be heavily influenced by economic conditions the authors claim \u8220\'20\'1Creconciles the MAC findings with much of the previous literature" that prior to 2008 the bulk of the evidence pointed to little impact of net migration on labour market outcomes for UK natives. So downturns produce atypical results that shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be generalised from.\par \par \uc2 So UK civil servants have confirmed that there appears to be no clear association between non-European \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and employment in the UK. Between 1995 and 2010, for every additional one hundred \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , zero British workers would not be employed. Theresa May was talking baloney.\par \par \uc2 * \u8220\'20\'1CImpacts of migration on UK native employment: An analytical review of the evidence", Ciaran Devlin and Olivia Bolt (Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) and Dhiren Patel, David Harding and Ishtiaq Hussain (Home Office).\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140309ea390030f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Clegg goes on attack against Ukip and warns of Labour vulnerability\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kiran Stacey, Political Correspondent   \par \uc2 752 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 20:03\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg has accused the UK Independence party of spreading "anger" and "bile" with its anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  stance, as a new study shows the eurosceptic party has the potential to win the votes of as many as one in three British voters.\par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrat leader attacked Ukip for its opposition to both EU membership and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , telling his party's conference in York: "An ungenerous, backwards looking politics has emerged in Britain."\par \par \uc2 He linked Ukip's success to the rise of more extreme rightwing parties across Europe, telling delegates: "The forces of chauvinism, protectionism and xenophobia have been emboldened. And there is no doubt about it. The fight is now on for the future of our continent."\par \par \uc2 In an unashamedly pro-European pitch to voters ahead of May's European elections, Mr Clegg said "Europe is our biggest export market and vital to British jobs. Pulling up the drawbridge is the surest way to wreck our economic recovery." And he made a direct attack on Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, saying: "The politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg's words came after a weekend of speeches and rallies at which Lib Dem MPs and supporters repeatedly attacked Ukip. The party has abandoned its usual reluctance to talk about its pro-EU and pro-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policies, which have limited public appeal, but have decided to make a virtue of them instead as they seek to avoid being completely wiped out in May.\par \par \uc2 One party official said: "There is nothing to lose now. We might as well make a virtue of who we are. At least we're making ourselves relevant."\par \par \uc2 But Ukip is unlikely to fade away quietly, according to a new book from two academics who have studied decades' worth of polling data and found that 30 per cent of UK voters could be persuaded to back the insurgent party.\par \par \uc2 The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.\par \par \uc2 <>Revolt on the Right, a new book examining the success of the anti-EU party , found the bulk of future support for Ukip coming from disenchanted former Labour supporters. One of its main findings will shock those who have branded Ukip "the Conservatives in exile", showing that eight of the 10 seats where Ukip has the most chance of winning in 2015 are currently held by Labour. The book has been written by Matthew Goodwin, a politics professor at Nottingham university, and Robert Ford, a lecturer at Manchester university.\par \par \uc2 Mr Goodwin said: "In terms of the 2015 election, Ukip is not as much of a threat to Labour as it is to the Conservatives. But beyond that, we see a significant amount of potential in very working class areas, including in Labour seats."\par \par \uc2 While the Lib Dems have been happy to attack Ukip directly, the Conservatives have been more reticent to do so for fear of alienating their own supporters, who they fear are the most likely to defect to the rightwing party. But the analysis of decades' worth of polling data shows the seats most receptive to Ukip's message are not in the east or southwest, where the party has traditionally focused, but in poorer northern areas, most of which are Labour-held.\par \par \uc2 The findings will boost those in Ukip who have argued the party should shift its focus away from attracting Conservative voters disenchanted with \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's leadership, and instead target a larger group of voters who feel left behind by all major parties.\par \par \uc2 Mr Ford and Mr Goodwin found that the number of voters who have concerns typical to Ukip voters - a blend of euroscepticism, opposition to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and a populist dislike of mainstream parties - could be as high as 30 per cent, suggesting the party could have a long-term future at the heart of UK politics.\par \par \uc2 The conclusion will dismay supporters of the three mainstream parties who believe the recent surge in Ukip's support - which has seen them overtake the Lib Dems in the national polls - is likely to fade after May's European elections.\par \par \uc2 Ukip's support has come largely from white, working-class, older men, often with few qualifications, whose alienation from mainstream politics has been increasingly steadily since the 1990s, the data show.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140309ea390035x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg has warned that the Liberal Democrats\u8217\'20\'19 opponents are trying to "airbrush out" the party's role in the UK's economic recovery.\par \par \uc2 In a policy-lite closing speech to the Lib Dem spring conference in York on Sunday, the Deputy Prime Minister signalled the start of the long campaign to next year's general election by emphasising the party's achievements in government. Mr Clegg said the history books will show that "the country was put back on track by a party which had never been in government before".\par \par \uc2 Senior party figures spent the weekend conference playing up the Lib Dems\u8217\'20\'19 influence as the minority party in coalition, reflecting fears that they lose votes for unpopular policies while the Conservatives get the credit for the economic recovery. An anti-austerity protest took place outside the conference venue over the weekend, while some angry voters have not forgiven the party for ditching a 2010 manifesto pledge to scrap university tuition fees.\par \par \uc2 Read more: Nick Clegg to launch veiled attack on Nigel Farage's 'bile'Lib Dems to demand \u163\'00\'A312,500 tax allowanceVince Cable: Tories are 'seriously irresponsible' for promising EU referendum\par \par \uc2 Despite the pounding that the Lib Dems have taken in the opinion polls, Mr Clegg is hopeful that the 2015 election could still result in the need for shared Government, whether it is again with David Cameron or with Labour. He said that while the current parliament has been about being in "emergency mode" to salvage the country from the financial crisis, \u160\'00\'A0the 2015-20 period will be focused on "reconstruction".\par \par \uc2 Sketching out his vision for a \u8220\'20\'1CGreat Britain, not little England," Mr Clegg said\u160\'00\'A0 the Lib Dems needed to protect UK from one-party rule because they are \u8220\'20\'1Cthe guardians of a modern, open and tolerant Britain." He said: \u8220\'20\'1CBetween now and the election, our aim is to build a coalition bringing together all of the liberal-minded, liberal-hearted men and women who love the Britain we love \u8211\'20\'13 and who want a party prepared to fight for it. That\u8217\'20\'19s the only coalition I care about."\par \par \uc2 The main theme of the conference was the party's commitment to staying in the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . In effect, the Lib Dems want to turn the May elections into a referendum on Europe, a high risk strategy given some polls suggest the party could lose all of its 12 MEPs.\par \par \uc2 In a thinly-veiled assault on Ukip, Mr Clegg warned that nationalistic extremism is making headway across Europe, from Hungary to France. "These are not far flung places," he argued. "This is our backyard. The forces of chauvinism, protectionism and xenophobia have been emboldened. And there is no doubt about it: the fight is now on for the future of our continent."\par \par \uc2 There was also a long passage on the things he loves about Britain so as to bat away Eurosceptic accusations that sticking with the EU is akin to selling out the UK. Among Mr Clegg's \u8220\'20\'1Cloves" were the football Premier League, shipping forecasts,\u160\'00\'A0 pomp and ceremony, cups of tea \u8211\'20\'13 and wearing a t-shirt and flip flops.\par \par \uc2 Clegg's Britain: Partiot Games\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg has his work cut out convincing us that he is an ordinary British bloke. He\u8217\'20\'19s got the Everyman accent, to be sure, but his blood is a heady cocktail of Russian, German, Polish, Ukrainian and Dutch, with a late tincture of English. He speaks several languages, and he is married to a Spaniard. On top of all that he\u8217\'20\'19s not only relaxed about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , but positively enthusiastic about the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So it is understandable that he should wish to remind the nation that he is not only British to the core, but proud to be so. Hence the long encomium for all things Brit in his speech yesterday.\par \par \uc2 Britain, he said, is as modest as it is proud, as inventive as it is conservative, as irreverent as it is obsequious. We love to queue even when there is no call to do so, and we believe a cup of tea is the solution to every problem.\par \par \uc2 Of course most of these distinctions could be cited to underline the argument that we are in fact the strangest nation on earth: listening to the shipping forecast 100 miles inland, sunbathing in the freezing cold\u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 The speech gave one the feeling of eavesdropping at breakfast with Miriam. Nick certainly makes a good stab at keeping his end up \u8211\'20\'13 but where will they go for their holidays?

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 James Brokenshire, junior home office minister, delivered a speech last week, in which he claimed that the middle classes were to blame for \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . It was roundly mocked, and described as "feeble and pathetic" by the Institute of Directors. Or, to put it another way, Mr Brokenshire had landed his boss \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  right in it.\par \par \uc2 Nannygate - and, for that matter, Cleanergate, Chauffeurgate and Gardenergate - has begun, as myriad ministers, employing \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to tend to their domestic chores and childcare needs, are hunted down by the media.\par \par \uc2 Having only just camouflaged their duck houses and stables to avoid rumours about expenses, MPs will probably be spending the next several days rapidly raising the wages of their poorly paid domestic retainers; brutally sacking illegals and calling the Colombian au pair, a distant cousin, twice removed. They have Mr Brokenshire to thank.\par \par \uc2 He has - albeit inadvertently - delivered a triple political whammy. He drew attention to the exclusive habits of the "wealthy metropolitan elite" who head his team and who ignore their own advice not to hire "cheap labour"; he triggered particular examination of the man at the top, and his wife, Samantha, who may or may not have been instrumental in helping her Nepalese nanny Gita Lima to secure British citizenship (fee: pounds 874).\par \par \uc2 Brokenshire also highlighted the ineffectiveness of the coalition's controls on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . It's not a bad run of hits for a ministerial first speech, although it may be a long time before there is a second. The Camerons' hiring of Lima was followed by short-term employment of an Australian, Sammi Strange. Such is the nature of globalisation that London parks - since this is largely metropolitan elite behaviour - are full of women from the Philippines, Poland, Estonia and Central and South America earning a living abroad.\par \par \uc2 In a fair world, they ought not to come cheap, certainly not cheaper than the British nursery nurses on pounds 12,000 a year. But not as costly as a British-made Norland nanny - often employed in (wealthy) homes abroad - on around pounds 50,000 after three years' training.\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire's moral outrage that foreigners come here to care for our children might have been tempered, and the increasingly divisive \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate eased, if he'd remembered that, for some time thousands of young British women have left these shores. Kitty Strutton, a bricklayer's daughter from Hackney, took care of Grand Duke Alexander of Russia in the 1840s. When she died, Alexander II, Tsar of Russia, and his four brothers carried her coffin.\par \par \uc2 Again, Anna Leonowens in her 30s took on the 82 children (and 39 wives) of Mongkut, the King of Siam, and, one presumes, nobody asked to see her \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  status.\par \par \uc2 The worlds of the elite and \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  have always been intertwined, and rarely at a decent price, especially when it comes to care. That's what ought to shock more than the scale of the unfortunate Mr Brokenshire's political clangers and the number of Bulgarian cleaners now out of ministerial closets.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140309ea390000q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer New Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: Let's be clear: we need more \uc2 immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 Kevin McKenna   \par \uc2 1,084 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 37\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The most uplifting and affirmative action I've seen this year occurred in distressing circumstances in Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street. The event was filmed by BBC Scotland for their series, The Street, chronicling the reality of life on Scotland's liveliest boulevard. In it we see Melo, a young African street musician, being racially abused by two white thugs. After one of the men approached him for the purposes of calling him a "black bastard", this is what we subsequently heard:\par \par \uc2 "What about the fucking British or the homeless? You are taking the fucking piss. You are milking our country for thousands, ya fucking black bastard.\par \par \uc2 "How much do you make sitting here busking every fucking day? You're making thousands. I pay taxes every fucking month; hundreds of pounds to keep you in the fucking country.\par \par \uc2 "You are a black bastard, admit it."\par \par \uc2 One of the white gargoyles then attempts to assault him. Melo, though, was having none of it and began rebuking his assailants while defending himself with a small trolley he had been using as a prop. Melo, who looks like a chap with substantial reserves of character and courage, decides he might as well go down fighting. "Get away from me," he tells them. "Any more and I will batter you both to the floor." It's thought that Melo had come to live in Glasgow after fleeing from the civil war in Angola, his home country.\par \par \uc2 For generations now, we Scots have congratulated ourselves that we don't have a racial problem on anything like the scale that exists in parts of England. It's a complacent attitude and one that has been blown apart since the start of this year. For there have been several other incidents reported in the press and television that have been as sickening as the attack on Melo. Two weeks ago a 17-year-old schoolboy making his debut in senior football had to be substituted when he became distressed at the abuse he was receiving from some supporters of Peterhead FC in the north east of Scotland.\par \par \uc2 On another occasion, Humza Yousaf, a young Asian MSP at Holyrood was subjected, in daylight, to a violent and racist tirade while selling the Big Issue. He had agreed to do this to raise awareness of issues surrounding homeless people in Scotland.\par \par \uc2 Few would suggest that these incidents mean that Scotland suddenly has a problem with racism. Yet we ought also to acknowledge that for each of these that were reported and recorded there will be dozens more that go unchronicled. Nor would it be wise to oversimplify the reasons why we are witnessing these bubbles on the surface of the cesspit. Yet it seems to me to be inescapable that some of these reasons are similar to those that we encounter when trying to explain the relatively sudden rise of a party like Ukip in Britain.\par \par \uc2 This is a party which, in the absence of any coherent economic, social or cultural policy, has become a significant power in England and Wales on the back of one of the most wicked deceptions ever practised on our southern neighbours: that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is intrinsically bad, that indolent people from "undesirable" countries (eastern Europe and most of Africa) are taking white Anglo-Saxon jobs, and that they are placing an unsustainable burden on the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and our system of benefits.\par \par \uc2 This has combined with a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment fuelled by tragic events such as the slaying of Private Lee Rigby. Rapidly, it seems, a residual fear and distrust of Islam, which had always lurked on the periphery of what we could call outright racism, has entered the mainstream. And it has done so as large elements of British society have begun to express themselves in distorted and strident militarism. In this, the humble poppy has also become a casualty. Once it was a silent and lovely memoriam to noble sacrifice, now it is used by our political and military elite to engender a sense of triumphalism. Not to be seen sporting a poppy in the month of November is to risk being accused of treason.\par \par \uc2 Much of this may be justified when Britain is facing mortal peril. But, in the absence of such, too many of us begin to look for an enemy within. Those who are other and different and puzzling become easy targets, especially those who are foolish enough to look content and prosperous. How dare they?\par \par \uc2 And now it seems that some of the tendrils of this creeping disease have reached Scotland. Well, we had better start to look aboot us, because these have the capacity to poison us. And we had better also start being loud and aggressive with the opposite message: Scotland needs more \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . If we still think that old age deserves choice and quality of life then some facts must be faced. Britain has an ageing population and Scotland's is ageing more rapidly than that of the rest of the UK. We need another one million \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  in this country paying taxes and national insurance as well as purchasing goods and services. This they tend to do and they tend not to get as sick and depressed as the rest of us. Happily, the SNP is the world's only nationalist party which actually welcomes \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . The Scottish Labour party, when it governed, enshrined this, too.\par \par \uc2 It's good to walk down the streets of your city and behold the sights and sounds and smells of different people from far away countries. How can that ever be bad?\par \par \uc2 In England in the 16th century, in a time considered to be more inhumane and uncivilised, the words of William Shakespeare (from Sir Thomas More) resonate still:\par \par \uc2 "Imagine that you see the wretched strangers,\par \par \uc2 Their babies at the backs, and their poor luggage\par \par \uc2 Plodding to th' ports and coast for transportation[. . .]\par \par \uc2 Should so much come too short of your great trespass\par \par \uc2 As but to banish you: whither would you go?\par \par \uc2 What country, by the nature of your error,\par \par \uc2 Should give you harbour?[. . .]\par \par \uc2 Why you must needs be strangers. Would you be pleased\par \par \uc2 To find a nation of such barbarous temper\par \par \uc2 That breaking out into hideous violence\par \par \uc2 Would not afford you an abode on earth,\par \par \uc2 Whet their detested knives against your throats,\par \par \uc2 Spurn you like dogs[? . . .]\par \par \uc2 [. . .] This is the strangers' case\par \par \uc2 And this your mountainish inhumanity."\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140309ea3900010\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PEOPLE\par \par \uc2 Who's more red than blue?\par \par \uc2 Vince Cable, business secretary. Cable, a Labour councillor in Glasgow in the 1970s, has always been closer to Labour than Tories. The big question is: would he serve in a second coalition with the Tories?\par \par \uc2 Simon Hughes\uc2 , justice minister and MP for Bermondsey, with its big housing estates, is unashamedly left on many issues. Has said the benefits cap will "damage the lives of hundreds of thousands of children".\par \par \uc2 Tim Farron, president of the Liberal Democrats, seems to find life with the Tories close to unbearable. Has described Tory \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  proposals as "ugly and stupid".\par \par \uc2 ISSUES\par \par \uc2 On which do Libs swing Left?\par \par \uc2 Education\par \par \uc2 Liberal Democrats detest the idea of allowing state schools to be run for profit, which is one of Michael Gove's objectives.\par \par \uc2 Also, they oppose the use of unqualified teachers. On both issues the party dovetails with Labour.\par \par \uc2 Taxing the rich\par \par \uc2 They want a mansion tax to hit owners of properties worth more than pounds 2m, something Cameron will not do, and want tax cuts for low earners more than for the middle classes.\par \par \uc2 Europe\par \par \uc2 Pro-EU through and through, setting them miles apart from Tories and closer to Labour. Most Tories are now prepared to contemplate leaving the EU. Lib Dems are as determined as ever to be in there.\par \par \uc2 Health\par \par \uc2 Opposition to the market-based reforms of the \uc2 NHS\uc2  led by Tory health secretary Andrew Lansley was a key part of the Liberal Democrat plan to show clear blue water between them and the Tories.\par \par \uc2 NORTH/SOUTH DIVIDE\par \par \uc2 Northern Lib Dems swing left to compete with Labour. They are angry that the coalition is not doing more to support the northern economy.\par \par \uc2 PEOPLE\par \par \uc2 Who's more blue than red?\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg, leader. Clegg was demonstrably happy to join a coalition with the Tories in 2010. He now says they have got worse, but is still regarded as more on the right than left.\par \par \uc2 Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury. Has been mocked by his party for being George's Osborne's willing accomplice. Condemned Ed Balls for proposing the reintroduction of the 50p tax rate.\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Browne, former home office minister who is so far to the right he almost falls off the edge. Criticised the Lib Dems for being a trolley that always veers to the left.\par \par \uc2 David Laws, education minister. Has called for deeper spending cuts and "lower marginal rates of tax at all income levels", though recently tore into Gove over independence of \uc2 Ofsted\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ISSUES\par \par \uc2 On which do they swing right?\par \par \uc2 Economy\par \par \uc2 Clegg, Alexander and Laws have been determined backers of Osborne's austerity plan and have not been derailed from that view by claims that deep public sector cuts have damaged growth. A lean state is best.\par \par \uc2 Tuition fees\par \par \uc2 Despite the huge damage inflicted upon Clegg's reputation, the party signed up to university tuition fees and is now refusing to budge on the issue. Labour wants to reform the system, but the Liberal Democrats believe the subject has been settled.\par \par \uc2 Welfare\par \par \uc2 Clegg's party is as one with the Tories on both the bedroom tax and the benefits cap. Clegg has echoed the Conservative line that limiting benefits to pounds 500 a week will encourage people to move back into work.\par \par \uc2 NORTH/SOUTH DIVIDE\par \par \uc2 On some issues - particularly Europe - Lib Dems in the south have to tack more to the right. Euro-enthusiasm is not a vote winner in the south-west where they remain strong.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140309ea390001j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer In Focus Pages\par \b \uc2 In Focus: Politics: Stuck in the middle, but with whom? Lib Dems tread a fine electoral line: In his party's spring conference, Nick Clegg must try to claim credit for coalition achievements while distancing himself from the Tories - and keeping lines open to Labour.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Toby Helm and Daniel Boffey   \par \uc2 968 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 28\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Addressing the Liberal Democrat spring conference in York yesterday, Nick Clegg extolled the virtues of further coalition government. Ruling again with the Tories, or for the first time with Labour, would not be an option on the ballot paper in 2015, he said. But a Labour-only, or Conservative-only, government would be "very bad indeed for the country".\par \par \uc2 One of Clegg's key messages these days is that his party should continue in power, as it has been for almost four years, because the current coalition has overall been a great success - and because the bigger parties cannot be trusted to run things on their own.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems have not only shared power but produced results, he says: pupil premiums have been delivered for children; there is a new life without any tax for millions of low earners; and more bounty is to come soon for everyone as the income tax threshold looks set to be raised still higher in this month's budget - thanks to the Lib Dems.\par \par \uc2 But, with his party way down in the polls and facing the possible loss of all 12 of its seats in the European parliament, Clegg has at the same time to perform a more urgent task: that of finding a way of differentiating the Lib Dems from the Tories, with whom they claim to have done so well, by attacking them whenever he thinks he can. It is a tricky balance and a difficult sell.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, there was plenty of Tory-bashing on show in York. Chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander accused the Conservatives of trying brazenly to claim credit for the Lib Dems' successes on tax thresholds, while Vince Cable, the business secretary, said the Conservatives were "fanning the flames of prejudice" over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Clegg went for both Tories and Labour on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , saying that their language was "truly dispiriting".\par \par \uc2 Portraying themselves as distinct from, and not puppets of, the Tories carries other dangers. When lurching away from the right, they have to be careful not to creep too far left towards Labour because to do so would threaten their other strategic aim which is to remain, in theory at least, equidistant from the other two parties, one of which is certain to be the largest after the next election.\par \par \uc2 It is really quite difficult being a Lib Dem these days. In pre-government times, when they were merely the protest party, they could say almost anything that would get them votes. Now, after several years of enjoying power and wanting more, it is all about positioning between two polar opposites while trying at the same time not to lose the party's own identity.\par \par \uc2 Clegg's forthcoming debates with Nigel Farage on the EU will give him a chance to position the Lib Dems as the most pro-European party, a message that will resonate with core backers. Again, this is about definition - so much more difficult as the smaller party in coalition than when powerless but independent.\par \par \uc2 In essence, what Lib Dems are saying is that only they can save the nation from unalloyed Tory or Labour government, and that - given the ills of the other parties - coalition is actually the best option. Senior figures say that when analysed in detail, the argument is sound because we live in an imperfect world and disagreement can be creative.\par \par \uc2 By positioning themselves as the safeguards of everything decent, however, they do place themselves on moral high ground that many would say ill befits a party that went back on its word on tuition fees and the post-election VAT rise, and which can fight elections as dirty as any.\par \par \uc2 The tortuously narrow and difficult path that Lib Dem MPs have to tread these days is neatly encapsulated in a document given to the Observer this weekend by rebel Lib Dem MPs, peers and council leaders from the north of England, angry about a lack of investment in their constituencies. It praises the coalition in one breath, yet damns it in the next.\par \par \uc2 "Jobs in the private sector are being created," they applaud, only to add: "However, in the north-east the loss of public sector employment almost cancels out private sector jobs growth, the public sector jobs being better remunerated."\par \par \uc2 The game is to question aspects of the government record in order to distance themselves from its failings and win approval on northern doorsteps, while trying to grab some credit from the last four years of sharing power.\par \par \uc2 Talking to the Observer yesterday, Alistair Carmichael, Scottish secretary and former chief whip, recognised that some might see a difficulty - even a contradiction - between savaging Labour and the Tories while also making the case for another coalition in which one of those two evils will necessarily form the larger part.\par \par \uc2 Ingeniously, he said that all governments were coalitions of interests, and that where the antagonists were different parties in coalition, the divergences at least provoked debates rather than internecine warfare; better, for example, than Labour under Tony Blair and \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 . "There was a coalition of sorts when Blair and Brown were in government," he said. "It is a more honest coalition when there are two parties. It is a better way of governing."\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Looking both ways: Nick Clegg's pitch to voters at the election is likely to be that coalition with either party is preferable to unalloyed Labour or Conservative government.

\par\par \uc2 Observer Home News Pages\par \b \uc2 Leading Ukip members 'backed pact with BNP': Proposal was canvassed among party's NEC, according to new book\b0\par\par\uc2 by Daniel Boffey, Policy Editor   \par \uc2 756 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A new book has revealed that Ukip considered forming a pact with the BNP six years ago, with two members of the party's national executive committee at the time in favour of the idea.\par \par \uc2 In 2008 Nigel Farage acknowledged that the BNP had proposed a deal for the European elections the following year, but insisted it had been unanimously rejected. Farage told reporters then: "I'm simply amazed that the BNP thought we would even consider such a thing."\par \par \uc2 Now the new book, Revolt on the Right, by Dr Matthew Goodwin and Dr Robert Ford - called the most definitive account yet of the Ukip movement - reveals that the BNP's proposal was canvassed among 17 members of the party's NEC. Two members supported the proposal, it has emerged.\par \par \uc2 Farage, who said he had been against a pact, told the authors: "There were a lot of people saying to me at that time, 'You've got to do a deal with them.' I even had Tory MEPs saying to me, 'Nigel, you've got to do a deal with these people.' We were being beaten by them regularly in local elections. So there was huge pressure on me. The nature of the deal was the BNP would stand in some regions in the European elections in the north, and Ukip would stand in the south, and that would be the electoral pact: we wouldn't oppose each other."\par \par \uc2 The political predicament of Ukip in 2008 contrasts with its potential today, the authors say. In the book, published this week, they say the party has emerged from the crash with the potential to attract a third of the electorate.\par \par \uc2 Around 30% of voters are now believed to be both Eurosceptic and opposed to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , or Eurosceptic and politically dissatisfied, the defining themes for Ukip. Such sentiments are continuing to grow in strength among the electorate, according to the authors, who draw on the biggest pool of data so far amassed on the political movement.\par \par \uc2 The book provides evidence that the share of voters holding Eurosceptic views and at least one other radical right belief has increased by five to seven percentage points since 2008. Ukip is widely seen as not having a credible manifesto and has faced serious questions about the calibre of its MEPs, the authors note.\par \par \uc2 This weekend, the party was dogged by claims that it had misused EU funds in paying staff working in the UK. Yet Goodwin, from \uc2 Nottingham University\uc2 , and Ford, of \uc2 Manchester University\uc2 , say the "army of potential supporters for Ukip is growing in size" and is being aided by continued anger at Labour's record and disaffection with the Tory leader.\par \par \uc2 They argue that Farage and Ukip face huge challenges in the first-past-the-post electoral system, and given the party's continued unpopularity among women, ethnic minorities, graduates and the young. However, Ukip is now the favoured electoral option among those who strongly disapprove of the EU - 20% of all British voters.\par \par \uc2 Over the past three years, the party has also performed better than Labour among older, working-class voters and those who are struggling financially. The party is using tactics similar to those once deployed by the Lib Dems, the authors say, in that they seek to deepen their vote in particular areas by getting into local councils and building strongholds.\par \par \uc2 It is claimed that, of the five constituencies where Ukip stands its best chance of general election success, four are Labour seats (Great Grimsby, Plymouth Moor View, Ashfield and Walsall North) and one is Tory (Waveney).\par \par \uc2 The academics claim Farage is fusing three issues to make a coherent message: "Farage's party now encourages voters to say 'no' three times: no to the Eurocrats in Brussels and Strasbourg; no to the politicians in Westminster; and no to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . This is not a grand ideological vision - there is no 'Farageism' - but it is a coherent and highly effective message."\par \par \uc2 They add: "Ukip is not a second home for disgruntled Tories in the shires; it is a first home for disaffected working-class Britons of all political backgrounds who have lost faith in a political system that ceased to represent them long ago."\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage said in 2008 that the proposal for a Ukip-BNP deal had been unanimously rejected, but a detailed book published this week claims otherwise.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140309ea390001w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

Then the Bullingdon boys' lack of appeal to the common man will eventually leave the country entirely crushed by The Ukip's steel-capped Hush Puppy, as a pipe and cardigan version of The Golden Dawn gradually reshapes society in its own image, smothering dissent under an enormous tartan travel rug of hate.\par \par \uc2 But whether one is a supporter of The Ukip's position on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  or not, at least it is easy to grasp. The Ukip dislikes \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  even more than it loves smoking in pubs. But I was born here so I'm all right. What concerns me, as a professional creative, is the apparent incoherence of the anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  party's arts policy, as this will have a direct effect on my own quality of life, financial future and access to touring theatre productions should I chose to leave London and live in a region.\par \par \uc2 The closing night's entertainment at The Ukip's conference, it transpired last week, took the form of a 45-minute routine by a comedian called Paul Eastwood, who did funny Asian accents, performed a traditional Midlands folk song which turned out to be an impression of a Muslim prayer call, and told three Asian women in the room that they looked a little bit lost. It sounds like any Christmas Day in our family in the 70s.\par \par \uc2 But without having attended The Ukip's party we can't be sure if Eastwood's act was an ironic parody of a pre-PC standup, whether the supposedly offensive material was daringly contrasted and contextualised by material from a more liberal and perhaps pro-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  or anti-white perspective, or whether Eastwood was so beloved by the entire crowd, perhaps full of people of many different cultures, that his interaction with the three Asian ladies had more of the flavour of gentle tickling from a drunk and over-friendly Christmas uncle, than of outright racial provocation.\par \par \uc2 But what's interesting, for anyone considering working as an artist under the forthcoming Ukip government, or reading or seeing anything interesting ever again should The Ukip be elected, is the response of the party's leader, Nigel Farage, whose simple statement on the Eastwood incident swiftly and definitively unraveled decades of anxieties about The Political Correctness Gone Mad: "Enough is enough," declared Farage. "Let people tell their jokes! If what they say is inappropriate they won't earn a living because they won't get booked again." Pure. Simple. Classic. It's the kind of straight-talking, no-nonsense approach that has already endeared Farage to millions of nuance-resistant voters nationwide.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, Farage's definitive statement on ethics and taste in art, defining culture purely in terms of its market value, was compromised this week by the contradictory actions of his deputy leader, Paul Nuttalls. Nuttalls has been trying to prevent the gay comedy singing duo Jonny and the Baptists from completing the 17 dates of their current Stop Ukip Tour. The duo have the political edge of 80s alternative comedy but Jonny Donahoe has a pop soul voice to win X Factor. We took my sister-in-law to see them in Edinburgh and she loved it. That said, they're not stadium sized, and their 17 dates are mainly in 150-seater rooms. The idea that a tour of this size, performed by two men and one guitar, could "stop Ukip" is surely part of what makes it funny to call it The Stop Ukip Tour\par \par \uc2 The Ukip's own press release on The Stop Ukip Tour is one of those strange press releases that describe the actions of the people responsible for issuing the press release as if they were actual news, with an independent life beyond the press release they have been written about in by themselves. It begins thus: "The Arts Council has come under fire for wasting public money on a political satire show due to start touring in the north west." But it hasn't. Because it didn't. It has only come under fire in this press release.\par \par \uc2 The Stop Ukip show itself has received no funding. Six of the 17 venues on the Baptists' tour receive no funding. The others perhaps have a contribution to running costs from a local authority, and Arts Council money. When I tour council-funded venues I am often surprised that they host people such as Roy Chubby Brown, Jim Davidson, hosts of dubious mediums, and Jon "Gaunty" Gaunt, who no doubt offend the sensibilities of arts administrators who learned their craft at polytechnics during the PC era of the 80s and 90s. But council-funded venues have complex briefs to balance populist, profit-making performances with things that tick aspirational arts boxes. Maybe Paul Nuttalls knows this, and deliberately issued one of those misleading statements, like Gove's one about teachers using the Mr Men to tell kids about Nazism, hoping it can cause maximum damage before it is discredited.\par \par \uc2 The Ukip's press release concludes, its doublespeak undimmed; "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and Ukip is very much the party of free speech but I. . . have written to the Arts Council about this. . . distasteful satire." Nuttalls's boss, Farage, meanwhile, sees the demand of the market as the only arbiter of taste, and does not believe judgments about the value of a performance can be substantiated above and beyond a simple measurement of its popularity.\par \par \uc2 Trying to shut down theatre productions, like burning books, always looks bad, I think. But saying anything is fine if it sells well seems philistine. To be fair to The Ukip, they are learning on the job, and formulating a coherent arts policy was never high on their agenda, which is concerned mainly with deterring foreigners. Even the Tories struggled to define the purpose and value of culture, with Maria Miller, the culture secretary, initially assessing it in purely commercial terms, even as Michael Gove insisted Middlemarch was inherently better than Twilight, despite the latter's vast commercial success in the free market. Given that these two intellectual titans struggled to find a workable definition of the value and purpose of culture, what hope is their for The Ukip? Well, should they need a culture secretary, The Ukip need look no further than the beloved mainstay of British entertainment who announced his intention of joining the party this week - Jethro. And Jethro says, "Bull'cks to Europe!"\par \par \uc2 Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle is on BBC2 at 10pm on Saturdays, except in Wales, where it appears randomly.

He regrets not standing against Mr Clegg in 2007, but opponents say that he has left it too late.\par \par \uc2 At 70, Mr Cable is nearly 30 years older than Mr Alexander. There is an even bigger gulf in their politics.\par \par \uc2 Mr Alexander is a robust ally of Chancellor George Osborne and was recently embarrassed by a Tory MP\u8217\'20\'19s suggestion that he had abandoned his Lib Dem roots and \u8216\'20\'18gone native\u8217\'20\'19 since joining the Treasury.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, Mr Cable has attacked Mr Osborne\u8217\'20\'19s \u8216\'20\'18austerity\u8217\'20\'19 cuts, led demands for a mansion tax and applauded the rise in \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At the Lib Dem spring conference in York yesterday, Mr Alexander took to the stage to say that, if the party is still in power after the Election, he will raise the annual income tax personal allowance from \u163\'00\'A310,000 to \u163\'00\'A312,500.\par \par \uc2 And in an apparent attempt to rebuff claims that he is too close to the Tories, Mr Alexander told activists that the\u160\'00\'A0 Lib Dems had fought the Conservatives to provide tax cuts for working people.\par \par \uc2 He boasted that Mr Clegg had already picked him to lead the Lib Dem team which will, if necessary, conduct fresh coalition talks with the Tories.\par \par \uc2 But on Friday, Mr Cable won a standing ovation from Lib Dem supporters in York after making a passionate speech about his political roots.\par \par \uc2 The Vince-versus-Danny feud threatens to overshadow Mr Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s attempts to portray the Lib Dems as Britain\u8217\'20\'19s only genuine pro-Brussels party and stave off humiliation at European elections in May.\par \par \uc2 One Lib Dem MP said: \u8216\'20\'18It\u8217\'20\'19s obvious that Danny\u8217\'20\'19s now on manoeuvres and sees himself as a future leader.

No rules were broken. Of course, the Grey Coat Hospital School\u160\'00\'A0 does not select by ability. But, like several state schools used by the London elite, it selects\u160\'00\'A0 in other ways and continues\u160\'00\'A0 to have many features of the grammar school it used to be.\par \par \uc2 Tens of thousands of parents, disappointed in their choice\u160\'00\'A0 of school on National Offer Day last week, could only dream\u160\'00\'A0 of getting such a schooling for their children.\par \par \uc2 And yet Michael Gove was not criticised for this. He was praised.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18All credit to Michael Gove and his journalist wife, Sarah Vine, whose daughter has been awarded a place at Grey Coat Hospital, an academy school in the heart of Westminster,\u8217\'20\'19 simpered the Left-wing Independent, adding: \u8216\'20\'18He will be the first Conservative Secretary of State for Education to have a child at a state secondary school.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Why would that be a good thing, you might ask? Why should we rejoice that Tory politicians are now taking to the same tricks that Labour hypocrites have used for years?\par \par \uc2 Grey Coat Hospital\u160\'00\'A0 is an interesting place. It is totally unlike most state secondaries. It defies egalitarian dogma, and accepts educational wisdom, and so is open\u160\'00\'A0 to girls only. Even without its religious requirements it is not simple to get into.\par \par \uc2 Its admissions rules go on for pages (I have posted them on my blog for anyone who wants to study them). You would have to be a mixture of Albert Einstein and St Thomas Aquinas\u160\'00\'A0 to work out what they actually mean in practice.\par \par \uc2 Why is this sort of filtering allowed, while open, honest, straightforward selection by ability is against the law?\par \par \uc2 The school is one of several that are well-known to pushy and well-informed London Blairites, such as the Goves, who know paying school fees will damage their images. Others include Camden School for Girls, William Ellis, and (for Roman Catholics) the London Oratory and Cardinal Vaughan. It is amazing what such people will do (one New Labour power couple moved house at enormous cost) to wangle their young into these places, which more or less guarantee Oxbridge entry at the end.\par \par \uc2 Harriet Harman, now in the news for other reasons, also got a child into Grey Coat Hospital, back in 1998. Nobody praised her. \u8216\'20\'18Harman Snubs Local Comp for Top Girls School\u8217\'20\'19, said the Daily Mirror at the time and accurately called Grey Coat Hospital an \u8216\'20\'18elite\u8217\'20\'19 school.\par \par \uc2 The real question is why Mr Gove\u8217\'20\'19s daughter isn\u8217\'20\'19t going\u160\'00\'A0 to a school her father has often praised to the heavens, his\u160\'00\'A0 own local comprehensive.\u160\'00\'A0 This is Burlington Danes Academy, a few minutes\u8217\'20\'19 walk from\u160\'00\'A0 the Education Secretary\u8217\'20\'19s\u160\'00\'A0 modest home.\par \par \uc2 After all, both Mr Gove and the Prime Minister have ladled warm words over Burlington Danes and its head, Dame Sally Coates. Dame Sally, once invited to speak\u160\'00\'A0 next to Mr Gove at a Tory conference, is shortly leaving for higher things, but surely such schools aren\u8217\'20\'19t wholly dependent on one charismatic head, are they?\par \par \uc2 In 2012 Mr Gove wrote a newspaper article in which he\u160\'00\'A0 listed Burlington Danes among schools in which \u8216\'20\'18excellence is becoming a universal expectation, academic study a driving purpose\u8217\'20\'19. Later that same year he numbered it among \u8216\'20\'18some superb state schools in disadvantaged areas generating fantastic results\u8217\'20\'19. He said of these schools: \u8216\'20\'18They do much better in exams than many schools, including private schools, in leafy areas. Their students win places at Oxbridge on merit. All because their heads, from the moment any child arrives, refuse to accept excuses for under-performance.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 And Mr Cameron himself, in\u160\'00\'A0 a speech in September 2011, commended Burlington Danes, saying it was doing much\u160\'00\'A0 better than four out of five\u160\'00\'A0 state schools in Surrey and Oxfordshire.\par \par \uc2 Could it be that these salesmen don\u8217\'20\'19t actually want to buy their own product? Could it be that they know in their hearts that their supposed school reforms, which they ceaselessly trumpet to us, are a mass of froth, oversold and boosted by dubious statistics?\par \par \uc2 Could it be that they know that single-sex selective schools, which they deny by law to nearly everyone else, are in fact better than failed, doomed comprehensives that can sometimes be dragged into shape by strong heads, only to sink back again to their former state?\par \par \uc2 If you want to know the answer, don\u8217\'20\'19t listen to what they say. Watch what they do.\par \par \uc2 What are they really aiming for?\par \par \uc2 Left-wing warmongers, who badly want some sort of conflict with Russia over Ukraine, are a mass of contradictions.\par \par \uc2 They say they\u8217\'20\'19re in favour of \u8216\'20\'18democracy\u8217\'20\'19, when in fact they are apologists for a naked coup d\u8217\'20\'19etat against an elected government by an armed mob.\par \par \uc2 They say they are against interference in other countries, when they excuse the blatant intervention of foreign politicians on the side of the Kiev rabble.\par \par \uc2 They say that Crimea has no right to secede from Ukraine, when they all supported the secession of Kosovo from Serbia.\par \par \uc2 They say they are concerned about Mr Putin\u8217\'20\'19s undoubtedly squalid and dishonest government. But they never complain about China, which is far more repressive and which is now trampling on the national independence of its imperial conquests in Tibet and Sinkiang.\par \par \uc2 When someone\u8217\'20\'19s not consistent, they\u8217\'20\'19re not telling you their real motives. Interestingly, most of the people who hate Russia also love the EU, and hate this country\u8217\'20\'19s independence and traditions. That might give you a clue as to what sort of people they really are \u8211\'20\'13 and explain why I sympathise with Russia.\par \par \uc2 Locking up our liberty\par \par \uc2 Anyone who really understands English freedom knows that jury trial is the most important safeguard we have \u8211\'20\'13 against corrupt police, against bullying officials and over-mighty government.\par \par \uc2 Quite simply, it stops the State locking people up because it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t like them.\par \par \uc2 Now, coincidentally choosing a week in which everyone is otherwise engaged, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, says he\u160\'00\'A0 wants to scrap the right to trial by jury for many \u8216\'20\'18minor\u8217\'20\'19 offences.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The Tory Party is in a mess over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . But the car crash that was \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister James Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s speech last week \u8211\'20\'13 which landed the Camerons\u8217\'20\'19 Nepalese nanny on the front pages \u8211\'20\'13 revealed far more than that.\par \par \uc2 No\u8201\'20\'0910 has been fretting that net migration will be higher by the Election than it was in 2010. This is a major liability for the Tories, with UKIP poised to exploit\u160\'00\'A0 voters\u8217\'20\'19 concerns.\par \par \uc2 It is migration from other EU countries that is pushing up the figures, and UKIP\u8217\'20\'19s answer is simple: leave the EU. It is, as one Tory Cabinet Minister says, \u8216\'20\'18their USP\u8217\'20\'19. The Tories, under their present leadership, are never going to be able to match that.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron, though, has not helped his cause with his poor choice for the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  job. When Mark Harper resigned from the post last month because his cleaner was working in the UK illegally, Cameron \u8211\'20\'13 who tries to avoid reshuffles wherever possible \u8211\'20\'13 bumped up underwhelming Home Office Minister\u160\'00\'A0 Brokenshire. This approach may have saved time but it has come at a high political cost.\par \par \uc2 It has infuriated Ministers who are normally loyal allies. One complains: \u8216\'20\'18\b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is one of the four big subjects for the next year. You need to put a grown-up there.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 But instead, Cameron promoted Brokenshire, a Minister with a tin ear for politics, who has embarrassed himself and his party by pinning the blame for rising \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on well-off families who hire foreign nannies or cleaners.\par \par \uc2 One Minister fumes: \u8216\'20\'18To lay into the middle classes is just bonkers\u8217\'20\'19. And a No\u8201\'20\'0910 source remarks: \u8216\'20\'18There should be a function in \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  Word that deletes your speech when you start writing about a metropolitan elite.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 No\u8201\'20\'0910 itself, though, can\u8217\'20\'19t escape some of the blame for the fall-out from the speech. Someone in No\u8201\'20\'0910 should have realised that questions were bound to follow about whether Cameron and the rest of the Tory Cabinet had ever employed a foreign nanny, cleaning lady or builders.\par \par \uc2 But there was little chance of that realisation being made when relations between No\u8201\'20\'0910 and the Home Office remain dire. There is a lack of trust between Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s people and the Theresa May camp, whom they suspect of being keener to advance the Home Secretary\u8217\'20\'19s interests than the Government\u8217\'20\'19s.\par \par \uc2 The Tories need to get the focus back on to the economy. This week, they will emphasise how Britain\u8217\'20\'19s excellence in science and technology will create the high-paying jobs of the future. As part of this, the Government is to boldly go where no \uc2 British Government\uc2  has gone before \u8211\'20\'13 by announcing support for a mission to find undiscovered planets.\par \par \uc2 David Willetts, the Science\u160\'00\'A0 Minister, will praise the building of a satellite and telescope designed to detect them. The mission might seem a bit out of this world, but it will boost British engineering and our rapidly growing space industry.\par \par \uc2 Back on Earth, the PM needs to turn his telescope to the flaws that the past few days have laid bare in his operation. If he is to win the Election, he needs everything to go right. He can\u8217\'20\'19t afford more weeks like this past one.\par \par \uc2 Stars kept waiting - thanks to the PM's 'other woman'\par \par \uc2 There was an array of impressive women in Downing Street on Thursday night for a reception linked to International Women\u8217\'20\'19s Day.\par \par \uc2 There was Winter Olympics gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold, chef Lorraine Pascale, a host of businesswomen and actress Helena Bonham Carter.\par \par \uc2 But as time ticked on, there was no Prime Minister. He was stuck in Brussels at a summit.\par \par \uc2 Home Secretary Theresa May had to step in, thanking guests for coming and telling them that David Cameron would be along as soon as he could.\par \par \uc2 When Cameron did finally make it, he tried to explain his lateness in reference to two powerful females. He quipped that he didn\u8217\'20\'19t want to miss the reception as the most important woman in his life, wife Samantha, was there.\par \par \uc2 But he was running late because of \u8216\'20\'18another quite powerful force in my life\u8217\'20\'19 \u8211\'20\'13 German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had been holding forth at the summit.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Cameron is off to see Merkel again today \u8211\'20\'13 he will have supper with her after they open a technology fair in Hanover.\par \par \uc2 The meeting comes just ten days after her visit to London. There\u8217\'20\'19s little doubt that Merkel is the most important foreign leader in Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s life.\par \par \uc2 Next year, David Cameron is set to become the first Tory Prime Minister in the modern era to send his child to a state secondary school.\par \par \uc2 No\u8201\'20\'0910 won\u8217\'20\'19t be drawn on Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s plans for the education of his children, but those close to the family are clear that he will follow the lead of Michael Gove and keep his daughter Nancy in the state sector.\par \par \uc2 At the moment, Nancy is at the same Church of England state primary school as Gove\u8217\'20\'19s daughter, but she is a year younger.\par \par \uc2 That means that in 12 months\u8217\'20\'19 time, it will be the Camerons waiting to see where their daughter has been offered a place.\par \par \uc2 Cameron has always said that while he would prefer state schools, he would decide as a \u8216\'20\'18parent not a politician\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 There is, however, no getting away from the political resonance of his decision. It will be a reminder of his personal commitment to public services and that he\u8217\'20\'19s a different kind of Tory.\par \par \uc2 Gove pushes the benefits of truancy plan\par \par \uc2 The next Tory manifesto will, I understand, propose docking child benefit from parents whose children play truant. The proposal is being pushed by Education Secretary Michael Gove.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron likes to joke that he has a book of things the Lib Dems have stopped him doing which will form the basis of his next manifesto.\par \par \uc2 This plan is a classic example. It was proposed two years ago with support from No\u8201\'20\'0910 and Gove \u8211\'20\'13 but was vetoed by Nick Clegg.\par \par \uc2 It appeals to the Tories because of the sense that if you receive something from the State you have obligations in return \u8211\'20\'13 in this case, to get your child to school.\par \par \uc2 At the top of the party, some favour making a detailed policy manifesto, while others, including Policy Minister Oliver Letwin, want a broader brush approach to maximise room for manoeuvre.\par \par \uc2 Either way, they\u8217\'20\'19ll need big-ticket items to show what a Tory-only Government would be like. Expect the truancy idea to be one of them.\par \par \uc2 * James Forsyth is the political editor of The Spectator\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140309ea390026r\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 'Flip flops, the BBC, the shipping forecast, Prince George, cups of tea, gay marriage and queueing': Nick Clegg reveals why he loves modern Britain in attack on rivals who want to turn the clock back\b0\par\par\uc2 MATT CHORLEY   \par \uc2 1,749 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 12:25\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

Thankfully we do not have the same extremism here in the UK. But that's not to say the fight isn't on for the future of our country too.'\par \par \uc2 Setting out why the Lib Dems are for remaining in the EU, he said: 'In, because Europe is our biggest export market and vital to British jobs. Because pulling up the drawbridge is the surest way to wreck our economic recovery.\par \par \uc2 'In because in the fight against climate change, and in a world where some of the biggest players are also the biggest polluters, Europe's nations can only make a difference if we work together.\par \par \uc2 'In because cooperation between our police forces is essential for catching the criminals who cross our borders. Crime crosses borders, so must we.\par \par \uc2 'In because Britain stands tallest in the world when we stand tall in Brussels, Paris and Berlin.'\par \par \uc2 David Cameron has set out plans to renegotiate the UK's links with Brussels and hold an in/out referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017 if he is returned to No 10 after the general election.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg acknowledged the case for change 'this isn't about some starry eyed affection for the EU - of course it needs reform'.\par \par \uc2 'But you can't change it with one foot out the door. You change it by taking your place at the table - which is where you protect Britain's national interest too.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg also repeated his attacks on Labour for 'economic incompetence' and the Tories for 'widening inequality'.\par \par \uc2 'Two parties encumbered by the same old prejudices; straitjacketed by the same old ideologies,' he said.\par \par \uc2 'And whichever way you look at it, left or right, if either of them get into government on their own, they will drag Britain in the same direction: backwards.\par \par \uc2 'No. That's not my Britain.

The politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub.\par \par \uc2 'So I'm drawing a line in the sand. I am going to defend the tolerant and modern Britain we love, and I am going to start by showing people what's at stake at the upcoming European elections: do you want Britain in Europe, or out?\par \par \uc2 'That's the real question in May. One party wants out. Another is flirting with exit. The other lot don't have the courage of their convictions on this - they're saying nothing at all.\par \par \uc2 'The Liberal Democrats are now Britain's only party of in. The only party out there explaining the clear benefits of Britain's place in Europe. The only party giving people the facts.'\par \par \uc2 He will insisted not all voters like Mr Farage's anti-EU, anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  message. 'There are plenty of people out there who don't want anger. They don't want bile. They want jobs. They want our country to have influence. They want opportunities. Ultimately they want hope.\par \par \uc2 'And that, Liberal Democrats, is what it all comes down to. Hope. It's the oldest dividing line in politics \u8211\'20\'13 hope versus fear \u8211\'20\'13 and it's back.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg will take on Mr Farage in two debates ahead of the contest, and in his speech to the Lib Dem spring conference in York, Mr Clegg will acknowledge the reasons behind the rise in Ukip's fortunes, which have seen them push his party into fourth place in opinion polls.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dem leader said that 'shattering collapse of the basic assumptions by which successive governments have run our economy' on top of a 'crisis of confidence' about the West's future caused by the rise of China and other emerging nations had led to an 'entirely understandable but dangerous urge to turn inwards'.\par \par \uc2 He will say: 'If anyone doesn't believe it, just glance across the Channel at our European neighbours, where a number of extremist parties are on the rise.\par \par \uc2 'We are lucky. Thankfully we do not have the same extremism here in the UK. But that's not to say the fight isn't on for the future of our country too.'\par \par \uc2 Setting out why the Lib Dems are for remaining in the EU, he said: 'In, because Europe is our biggest export market and vital to British jobs. Because pulling up the drawbridge is the surest way to wreck our economic recovery.\par \par \uc2 'In because in the fight against climate change, and in a world where some of the biggest players are also the biggest polluters, Europe's nations can only make a difference if we work together.\par \par \uc2 'In because cooperation between our police forces is essential for catching the criminals who cross our borders. Crime crosses borders, so must we.\par \par \uc2 'In because Britain stands tallest in the world when we stand tall in Brussels, Paris and Berlin.'\par \par \uc2 David Cameron has set out plans to renegotiate the UK's links with Brussels and hold an in/out referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017 if he is returned to No 10 after the general election.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg acknowledged the case for change 'this isn't about some starry eyed affection for the EU - of course it needs reform'.\par \par \uc2 'But you can't change it with one foot out the door. You change it by taking your place at the table - which is where you protect Britain's national interest too.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg also repeated his attacks on Labour for 'economic incompetence' and the Tories for 'widening inequality'.\par \par \uc2 'Two parties encumbered by the same old prejudices; straitjacketed by the same old ideologies,' he said.\par \par \uc2 'And whichever way you look at it, left or right, if either of them get into government on their own, they will drag Britain in the same direction: backwards.\par \par \uc2 'No. That's not my Britain. That's not the Britain I love. And I am not going to sit back while either of them sweep in and leave this nation diminished and divided because they still don't understand what makes our country great.'\par \par \uc2 NICK CLEGG'S SPEECH IN FULL:\par \par \uc2 Since I became the Deputy Prime Minister I have had the privilege of spending a bit of time representing Britain's interests in other parts of the world.\par \par \uc2 I have visited Latin America and Asia to boost exports. I have been to Africa, where we are building better education systems as well as helping fight corruption, poverty and disease. I have travelled to different parts of Europe and the United States to promote British trade.\par \par \uc2 And while each trip varies from the last, there is a thread which runs through them all: you get to see Britain through other people's eyes.\par \par \uc2 Everywhere I have been \u8211\'20\'13 every nation around the planet \u8211\'20\'13 has its own story about Britain.\par \par \uc2 On a trade mission to South Korea I paid my respects at a war memorial at the bottom of a hill where, during the Korean War, British soldiers \u8211\'20\'13 heavily outnumbered \u8211\'20\'13 fought for three solid days to hold back North Korean and Chinese forces.\par \par \uc2 It is a battle that every single South Korean schoolchild learns about. Had we given up or been defeated, it could have cost their grandparents the war.\par \par \uc2 For Mexico, Britain is the first European country to have officially recognised their independence following their liberation from colonial rule. That means something to them.\par \par \uc2 In Colombia Britain is the nation that built their first railways.\par \par \uc2 Lynne Featherstone and I were in Ethiopia, for whom Britain is now the first member of the G8 to have met the decades-old promise by rich countries to spend 0.7 per cent of our national wealth on aid for the developing world. Something we have long argued for and this Coalition has delivered.\par \par \uc2 So wherever you go one thing is clear: people don't listen to our country out of some nostalgic deference to an old power. They listen because of who we are. Because of the things we've done. Because of the leadership we continue to show. And that makes me incredibly proud.\par \par \uc2 I love Britain.\par \par \uc2 I love it for all its contradictions.\par \par \uc2 I love that we are as modest as we are proud.\par \par \uc2 I love the way we can cherish our traditions yet innovate relentlessly, churning out one ingenious invention after the next. The telephone, the steam engine, the jet engine, the world wide web; the same nation that came up with stainless steel is now developing graphene \u8211\'20\'13 the strongest material the world has ever seen. Oscar winning visual effects; cutting-edge design; theatre, fashion, music, film \u8211\'20\'13 you name it, we do it, and we're up there with the best.\par \par \uc2 I love that a country capable of extraordinary pomp and ceremony can still retain a spiky irreverence towards its establishment. A country where we line the streets waving our Union Jacks wildly to welcome the arrival of Prince George, and the next moment we're chuckling at Private Eye's front page: 'Woman Has Baby'.\par \par \uc2 I love that we insist on queuing when we go abroad, even when the locals don't.\par \par \uc2 I love that the BBC and \uc2 NHS\uc2  are known and respected across the planet.\par \par \uc2 I love that our cities are home to every race, religion, colour and language in existence.\par \par \uc2 I love Miriam telling me that the feeling of freedom you get in Britain simply doesn't exist anywhere else.\par \par \uc2 I love that the shipping forecast is listened to by insomniacs of all ages, right across the country, miles from the sea.\par \par \uc2 I love how excited we get at the glimpse of any sun, insisting on staying out in our t-shirts and flip-flops \u8211\'20\'13 even when it's obviously still cold.\par \par \uc2 I love living in a country synonymous with human rights and the rule of law.\par \par \uc2 I love that it was British lawyers who drafted the European Convention on Human Rights and a British Prime Minister who helped launch the Single Market. And I enjoy reminding my Coalition partners that it was a Prime Minister from their party at that.\par \par \uc2 I love that we do respond \u8211\'20\'13 the clich\u233\'00\'E9 is true \u8211\'20\'13 to every problem no matter how big or small with the same thing: a cup of tea.\par \par \uc2 I love that, wherever you go in the world, you'll find football fans obsessed with the Premier League.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 I love that we are a family of four different countries, each with their own characters, traditions and good-natured rivalries. And that's why I want to see \u8211\'20\'13 we all want to see \u8211\'20\'13 Scotland stay in our family of nations later this year.\par \par \uc2 I look at what's happening in places like Russia, where the government is effectively criminalising homosexuality, and I love that Britain is a place where you can be gay and proud \u8211\'20\'13 and now you can get married too.\par \par \uc2 Above all I love that, while we may be an island, we have always looked beyond our shores.\par \par \uc2 Throughout our history, when we have seen trouble in the world we haven't just looked the other way; we haven't just crossed to the other side of the street; Britain doesn't peer out at the rest of the world and shrug its shoulders. We are always at our best when we play our part.\par \par \uc2 This summer marks the centenary of the First World War. One hundred years ago hundreds of thousands of British troops headed into a conflict from which many of them would never return. When it ended my grandfather, not long out of school, climbed onto the roof of Westminster Abbey and watched the survivors come home \u8211\'20\'13 bloody, bruised and broken by the things they had seen.\par \par \uc2 He told me that, in spite of everything, he was desperately upset that he hadn't been called up to the front: because he passionately believed that to be a British soldier, defending our values of liberty and peace, was the most noble thing you could be.\par \par \uc2 Years later he married a woman who had herself come here to avoid conflict and revolution: my grandmother. She escaped Russia during the revolution, crossing Europe with her family and eventually settling in London. For her Britain offered a place of stability and safety. At a moment of great upheaval, this country welcomed her in and let her call it home.\par \par \uc2 There are few nations as open-minded and warm-hearted as ours. Smart, funny, compassionate Britain. Always changing, always evolving Britain. Humble enough to understand that we must work with others. Confident enough to lead.\par \par \uc2 For me it is these qualities that make this nation great \u8211\'20\'13 these great liberal qualities. Not some sepia-tinted memory of Empire. Not some stuffy parochialism dressed up as patriotism.\par \par \uc2 In the 21st Century, in a highly competitive, fluid and fast-moving world we hold our own because of our ability to embrace the future rather than cling to the past. It is our ability to look forward and outward and our capacity for reinvention \u8211\'20\'13 in other words our liberalism \u8211\'20\'13 that ensures this small island remains a giant on the world stage.\par \par \uc2 The question \u8211\'20\'13 one of the biggest questions of our time \u8211\'20\'13 is how we protect the liberal values of this nation.\par \par \uc2 Six years ago we suffered an unprecedented cardiac arrest in our banks.\par \par \uc2 This wasn't just a recession. It was a shattering collapse of the basic assumptions by which successive governments had run our economy since the Big Bang.\par \par \uc2 This wasn't just a downturn. We were a nation plunged into uncertainty as the thumping heart of our economy ground to a halt.\par \par \uc2 And you have to remember: even before this happened a quiet crisis of confidence was already creeping over developed economies like ours. Global power, money and influence have been shifting from West to East and from North to South for years. The previously fashionable view that the world would automatically slide towards greater freedom and democracy now feels presumptuous and na\u239\'00\'EFve. Within our lifetimes America will no longer be the world's biggest economy. It will be China: an authoritarian state.\par \par \uc2 Taken together, in societies across the Western world, these experiences have created an entirely understandable but dangerous urge to turn inwards. An urge to reject the new or unfamiliar and to shun the outside world.\par \par \uc2 If anyone doesn't believe it, just glance across the Channel at our European neighbours, where a number of extremist parties are on the rise.\par \par \uc2 In Greece's last parliamentary election the Golden Dawn Party secured 18 MPs. They ran on an anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  platform. Their slogan? \u8216\'20\'18So we can rid the land of this filth'.\par \par \uc2 Hungary's Jobbik Party now has 43 MPs, one of whom has called for a register of Jews who he claims \u8216\'20\'18pose a national security risk'.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 In Bulgaria, Ataka makes up 10 per cent of the National Assembly. One of their MPs has reviled Syrian refugees as 'terrible, despicable primates'.\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 In the Netherlands Geert Wilder's PVV party is polling at around 18 per cent. They have called for the Koran to be banned, comparing it to Mein Kampf.\par \par \uc2 Front National.\u160\'00\'A0 Around 21 per cent. Their leader, Marine Le Pen, has compared Muslims praying in the streets to the Nazi occupation of France.\par \par \uc2 These are not far flung places. This is our backyard. The forces of chauvinism, protectionism and xenophobia have been emboldened. And there is no doubt about it: the fight is now on for the future direction of our continent.\par \par \uc2 We are lucky. Thankfully we do not have the same extremism here in the UK. But that's not to say the fight isn't on for the future of our country too.\par \par \uc2 An ungenerous, backwards looking politics has emerged in Britain. The politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub.\u160\'00\'A0 So I'm drawing a line in the sand. I am going to defend the tolerant and modern Britain we love, and I am going to start by showing people what's at stake at the upcoming European elections: do you want Britain in Europe, or out?\par \par \uc2 That's the real question in May. One party wants out. Another is flirting with exit. The other lot don't have the courage of their convictions on this \u8211\'20\'13 they're saying nothing at all.\par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrats are now Britain's only party of IN. The only party out there explaining the clear benefits of Britain's place in Europe. The only party giving people the facts.\par \par \uc2 IN because Europe is our biggest export market and vital to British jobs. Because pulling up the drawbridge is the surest way to wreck our economic recovery.\par \par \uc2 IN because in the fight against climate change, and in a world where some of the biggest players are also the biggest polluters, Europe's nations can only make a difference if we work together.\par \par \uc2 IN because cooperation between our police forces is essential for catching the criminals who cross our borders. Crime crosses borders, so must we.\par \par \uc2 IN because Britain stands tallest in the world when we stand tall in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 This isn't about some starry eyed affection for the EU \u8211\'20\'13 of course it needs reform. But you can't change it with one foot out the door. You change it by taking your place at the table \u8211\'20\'13 which is where you protect Britain's national interest and promote our values too.\par \par \uc2 How else would we, right now, be making our presence felt against Vladimir Putin's Cold War aggression in the Ukraine?\par \par \uc2 The EU is a global economic superpower. By standing shoulder to shoulder with our European partners we have the clout to defend not just our own interests, but the interests of our continent as a whole.\par \par \uc2 So, for all these reasons, I'm IN.\par \par \uc2 Forget the lazy assumption that, in the court of public opinion, the eurosceptics will automatically win. There is nothing automatic about election results.\u160\'00\'A0 A few months ago, when I asked people to take to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to tell me why they're IN, they did so in their thousands. It was our most successful online campaign ever.\par \par \uc2 There are plenty of people out there who don't want anger. They don't want bile. They want jobs.\par \par \uc2 They want our country to have influence. They want opportunities. Ultimately they want hope.\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 And that, Liberal Democrats, is what it all comes down to. Hope. It's the oldest dividing line in politics \u8211\'20\'13 hope versus fear \u8211\'20\'13 and it's back.\par \par \uc2 We talk a lot about reducing the deficit, fiscal consolidation, bringing down public sector debt, increasing GDP, creating private sector jobs. But in the end what we're really talking about is giving the British people the confidence to once again look to their futures with hope.\par \par \uc2 That's how you lead a nation through difficult times. That's how you hold a country together when its citizens are feeling the pressure. And that's what the last four years in government have been about.\par \par \uc2 There is still a long way to go and many people are still feeling the squeeze. But after a period of grave uncertainty, the British people can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.\par \par \uc2 I hope that makes each and every one of you feel proud: there would be no recovery without the Liberal Democrats.\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 No recovery if we hadn't decided to enter into coalition in order to provide the country with strong government.\par \par \uc2 No recovery if we hadn't held our nerve and stuck to the plan.\par \par \uc2 No recovery if we had allowed the Coalition's economic strategy to be solely about cuts. Sorting out the nation's finances is essential but equally as important is investing in the foundations of lasting growth.\par \par \uc2 The unprecedented Treasury support that will transform Britain's roads and rail.\par \par \uc2 The world's first Green Investment Bank.\par \par \uc2 The billions of pounds spent on businesses across the country.\par \par \uc2 The million more young people who are now qualifying as apprentices.\par \par \uc2 Don't let anyone airbrush out our role. Thanks to the heroic efforts and sacrifices of millions of people we have been able to pull this country back from the brink. Under extraordinary pressure we have achieved extraordinary things. And no matter what our critics say, when the history books are written they will say that, most extraordinary of all, the country was put back on the right track by a party which had never been in government before but which had the guts and the courage to do what it took.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 And now a different challenge awaits.\par \par \uc2 We've been in emergency mode for the last four years, but that is slowly changing. If this parliament has been about a rescue, the next will be about reconstruction and renewal.\par \par \uc2 If we are truly ambitious for our country, Britain's future cannot be like its past.\par \par \uc2 Successive governments relying on an overheated financial sector; presiding over a wildly imbalanced economy where the gap between rich and poor grew; where the North fell further and further behind the South.\par \par \uc2 Successive administrations jumping from one set of public service reforms to the next and Whitehall just seemed to carry on regardless as more and more power was sucked up to the centre.\par \par \uc2 I don't want us ever to go back there. It cannot be right that the country goes through all of this pain only to end up where we started when it all went wrong.\par \par \uc2 In this coalition we have begun to turn the page, but the real test will come in the next parliament \u8211\'20\'13 when government will have to show whether or not we have really, genuinely, learnt from the mistakes of the past.\par \par \uc2 And I simply do not believe that our opponents have. I simply do not believe that they are up to this task.\par \par \uc2 Left to their own devices what are they offering the British people?\par \par \uc2 Profligacy. Economic incompetence. A bloated and cumbersome state. Politicians who think that all they need to do to prove themselves is posture against business. A leadership desperate but unable to break free from the grip of its Union paymasters. A party that cannot be relied upon to keep the economy safe; that wants us to put them back behind the wheel even though they still won't admit how badly they got it wrong.\par \par \uc2 Or how about widening inequality. A remorseless shrinking of our public services. A party that claims we're all in it together and yet refuses to ask the wealthy to pay even a penny more in tax towards the on-going fiscal effort. A party which will instead single out one group \u8211\'20\'13 the working age poor \u8211\'20\'13 for especially tough sacrifices. \u163\'00\'A312bn worth of especially tough sacrifices, from people who are trying to work their way out of poverty and who we should be helping stand on their own two feet.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 A weak economy. An unfair society. If it all sounds depressingly familiar it's because most of us have lived through it all before. Two parties encumbered by the same old prejudices; straitjacketed by the same old ideologies. And whichever way you look at it, left or right, if either of them get into government on their own, they will drag Britain in the same direction: backwards.\par \par \uc2 No. That's not my Britain. That's not the Britain I love. And I am not going to sit back while either of them sweep in and leave this nation diminished and divided because they still don't understand what makes our country great.\par \par \uc2 Liberal Democrats think of that when you're out campaigning in the crucial coming weeks \u8211\'20\'13 in your wards, in your communities, in your regions for our hardworking councillors and our excellent team of MEPs.\par \par \uc2 When I tell you that we need to get back into government again \u8211\'20\'13 protecting Britain from one party rule \u8211\'20\'13 this is why:\par \par \uc2 Because we are the guardians of a modern, open and tolerant Britain.\par \par \uc2 Because we are the only party who will not ask the British people to choose between a stronger economy and a fairer society. They don't have to. They can have both if we make our shared mission enabling every single person to get on in life.\par \par \uc2 Because we are the only party with the imagination and ambition needed to ensure Britain draws a line under some of our worst times with our best qualities intact.\par \par \uc2 In government again the Liberal Democrats will continue rewiring our economy so that our banks are the servant and not the master. So that, instead of fake booms and reckless consumption, we invest in growth that is balanced and sustainable, which stretches across every corner of Britain and which conserves our natural resources too.\par \par \uc2 That is how we embrace a better future rather than repeat the mistakes of the past.\par \par \uc2 We'll finish the job of balancing the books, but continuing to spread the burden fairly, as we have been in this government \u8211\'20\'13 giving Britain a stronger economy and a fairer society too.\par \par \uc2 The future, not the past.\par \par \uc2 We'll continue correcting the imbalance in our tax system, so that it doesn't just protect the wealthy but properly rewards work.\par \par \uc2 And, yes, that means that in the coming Budget Danny Alexander and I are pushing to take the Liberal Democrat income tax cut even further than we had originally planned in this parliament.\par \par \uc2 We are about to hit the target that was on the front page of our manifesto: raising the personal allowance so that no one pays a penny of income tax on the first \u163\'00\'A310,000 they earn, saving over 20 million people \u163\'00\'A3700. Now we want to go beyond that, taking the total tax cut to \u163\'00\'A3800.\par \par \uc2 And if we're in government again we'll go further still: no one paying a penny in tax on the first \u163\'00\'A312,500 they earn.\par \par \uc2 Fairer taxes. The future, not the past.\par \par \uc2 We'll create an education system that, from toddler to graduate, allows our all of our children to rise as far as their talents and efforts will take them, irrespective of the circumstances of their birth.\par \par \uc2 The future, not the past.\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 We'll transfer ever more power to our cities and communities so that they can drive their own destinies and we break Whitehall's grip for good.\par \par \uc2 The future, not the past.\par \par \uc2 We will ensure that this country rises to the challenge that will define the 21st Century: playing our part in the fight against climate change, for the sake of our children and the planet we leave behind.\par \par \uc2 The future, not the past.\par \par \uc2 And we will live up to our greatest traditions by keeping Britain engaged, outward facing, a heavyweight in Europe and a leader in the world.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 If this sounds like the Britain you want, the Liberal Democrats are the party for you.\par \par \uc2 Between now and the election my aim \u8211\'20\'13 our aim \u8211\'20\'13 is to build a coalition bringing together all of the liberal-minded, liberal-hearted men and women who love the Britain we love \u8211\'20\'13 and who want a party prepared to fight for it. That's the coalition I care about. A coalition of all the people who want to keep this nation open, tolerant, compassionate and strong.\par \par \uc2 So to the people out there who may not have voted for us before: it doesn't matter, that's the past. What matters now is the kind of country you want to live in. The kind of nation you want us to be.\par \par \uc2 Open not closed.\par \par \uc2 In not out.\par \par \uc2 Great Britain not little England.\par \par \uc2 Forward not back.\par \par \uc2 Hope not fear.\par \par \uc2 The future not the past.\par \par \uc2 If you have faith in this country, if you believe in Britain's values, if you still want this incredible island of ours to keep punching above our weight and shaping the world so that it is a better place, put the Liberal Democrats back in government again \u8211\'20\'13 let us protect the Britain you love.\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140309ea39005k4\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Femail\par \b \uc2 Hallelujah!

According to forecasters in the U.S., the more successful you are, the less you have to express it.\par \par \uc2 By dressing to blend in to the crowd, you\u8217\'20\'19re staying \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19m confident in myself\u8217\'20\'19. Think size medium, mass-market ranges like Gap and Converse, plain T-shirts and stonewash denim.\par \par \uc2 Trend-spotters cite Barack Obama in his comfy jeans and dreary baggy white shirts as a good example, or Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who only ever wore a black turtle neck and nondescript jeans.\par \par \uc2 Look at \uc2 Facebook\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2  and tech genius Bill Gates \u8212\'20\'14 they always look utterly banal, not a logo in sight.\par \par \uc2 Zuckerberg sticks to a round-neck T-shirt and only wears cheap clothes, and Bill Gates has the ultimate geek haircut teamed with those tragic glasses and a plain white shirt.

You\u8217\'20\'19d think that the people who work in fashion would all look different, expressing their personal taste.\par \par \uc2 But look at the occupants of the front row at shows \u8212\'20\'14 lemmings in long skirts, ankle socks, all looking like they\u8217\'20\'19ve all been hatched at the same on-trend factory.\par \par \uc2 High fashion has turned them into consumer- driven clones.\par \par \uc2 Look at Lily Allen, turning up at everything to promote her upcoming album in a different outfit every day, even tweeting a photo of herself on the Tube. And what about Amy Childs tweeting pictures of herself wearing four frocks from her new range in 24 hours?\par \par \uc2 These women pride themselves on being fearless spokeswomen, and yet they are just clotheshorses enslaved by fashion.\par \par \uc2 To swap frocks so often surely shows a lack of confidence.\par \par \uc2 We can moan that men don\u8217\'20\'19t take us seriously, but perhaps we are addicted to dressing to get noticed \u8212\'20\'14 so maybe we can learn from the cult of normcore.\par \par \uc2 Cressida Bonas turned up with Prince Harry at a charity event at Wembley last week in dreary jeans, a plain, dark jacket and a sweatshirt \u8212\'20\'14 I think she\u8217\'20\'19s got the message. Until the fashion police get their hands on her.\par \par \uc2 Sweep these clueless fools out of politics\par \par \uc2 New \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, James Brokenshire, put his foot in it by claiming that a \u8216\'20\'18wealthy metropolitan elite\u8217\'20\'19 employing cheap labour was to blame for uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , by denying our working classes jobs.\par \par \uc2 I challenge Mr Brokenshire to find this untapped pool of British talent.\par \par \uc2 My cleaners have been Spanish, Polish and Latvian \u8212\'20\'14 and all have cost at least \u163\'00\'A310 an hour.\par \par \uc2 They are often highly qualified, working to pay their tuition fees or building capital to start a business back home.\par \par \uc2 Why should we be demonised for paying a cleaner from another EU country?\par \par \uc2 Who is this wealthy metropolitan elite this clown refers to anyway?\par \par \uc2 They are usually working women who want a life outside the home, willing to settle for very little cash in hand after paying for cleaning and childcare.\par \par \uc2 Another politician who doesn\u8217\'20\'19t live in the real world.\par \par \uc2 The lonely soul with a lesson for gold-diggers\par \par \uc2 How refreshing to read about Tony Hawken, the man divorcing the richest female entrepreneur in Britain, who isn\u8217\'20\'19t opting for a massive pay-off or a bitter court battle over shares.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hawken married Xiu Li Hawken more than 20 years ago, after they met on a blind date \u8212\'20\'14 he was a maths teacher, she was learning English.\par \par \uc2 Since then, his wife has built a chain of 22 shopping centres across China, runs a leading football team there, and is worth \u163\'00\'A31.1\u8201\'20\'09billion, while he has stayed in this country raising their son, now 17. On a recent holiday, he said he was \u8216\'20\'18uncomfortable\u8217\'20\'19 when his wife chose wine costing \u163\'00\'A3900 a bottle \u8212\'20\'14 he\u8217\'20\'19s a man of modest tastes who prefers to drink at\u160\'00\'A0 a Wetherspoons\u160\'00\'A0 pub, and buys books from charity shops. Mr Hawken still tutors under-privileged students for free.\par \par \uc2 He settled for less than \u163\'00\'A31\u8201\'20\'09\u8201\'20\'09million and says he wishes he\u8217\'20\'19d divorced years ago so he could have found a girlfriend. I don\u8217\'20\'19t think he\u8217\'20\'19ll have any trouble, though his scruffy beard might have to get the chop.\par \par \uc2 Filthy little mutt that's muscled in on my man\par \par \uc2 My partner has bought a puppy \u8212\'20\'14 claiming he wanted unconditional love and devotion, so that me put in my place.\par \par \uc2 I admit I\u8217\'20\'19m not a pet person (years ago I gave my cat to my mother when it enraged me by weeing in my handbag), but now I have to learn to communicate with Badger \u8212\'20\'14 the new addition to our house, and anticipate his needs.\par \par \uc2 I just thought dogs moaned or barked, but a leading animal researcher reckons animals are capable of telling us how happy or miserable they are.\par \par \uc2 Professor Ian Duncan will reveal his ground-breaking findings at a conference devoted to the science of animal thinking and emotion in the U.S. next week. He has devised tests where animals are asked a question repeatedly, and claims the results reveal what they feel. His research into what chickens and pigs feel has led to change in the rules on battery farming.\par \par \uc2 So what is going on in our house? Our mini Border terrier has cleverly planted a big poo right in front of where I watch TV, followed by a puddle by the back door. He moans if he can\u8217\'20\'19t sit on the sofa, and walkies are regarded as a chance to trip me over with his lead.\par \par \uc2 As far as I can see, the dog is getting his message across very successfully, which is that I\u8217\'20\'19m an irritant he will overcome.\par \par \uc2 My partner and he are\u160\'00\'A0 deeply in love, and I\u8217\'20\'19m just\u160\'00\'A0 a wallflower.\par \par \uc2 The wonderful weather at the weekend brought traffic jams and the first rash of middle-aged men with beer guts dressed as teenagers in cut-offs or shorts. It also means English strawberries in supermarkets earlier than ever. Should we celebrate? Does fruit grown under glass in winter taste of anything?\par \par \uc2 For my money, the best strawberries are those that come later, ripening outside in what we used to call summer, perfumed and soft. So much fruit has zero flavour now \u8212\'20\'14 especially those highly priced mini figs in Waitrose and \uc2 Tesco\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 They smell musty and are like eating a bit of phone directory, a million miles from slurping a soft ripe black fig in Italy in August. Why do we want summer fruit in winter? It\u8217\'20\'19s a sickness.\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020140310ea39000ut\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw337\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5055\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 News | SPECIAL REPORT International Women\u8217\'20\'19s Day Women have a long way to go in the worldwide battle against gender imbalance, as well as the violence and sexual abuse they suffer. Sarah Morrison reports on the persistent problems that affect half the population\par \par \uc2 It is the day after the night before. Plays were performed, films broadcast, speeches given and thousands marched on the capital\u8217\'20\'19s streets to mark International Women\u8217\'20\'19s Day yesterday. But what, if anything, is next?\par \par \uc2 Global equality does not seem likely. One in three women worldwide has experienced violence or sexual abuse; 140 million women and girls globally have been subjected to female genital mutilation; 215 million women cannot access contraception; about 14 million young girls will be married this year.\par \par \uc2 Yet campaigners around the world have not given up. With 364 days left until the next landmark, The Independent on Sunday asked seven women, from politicians to activists and actors, what they thought were the biggest issues facing women this year.\par \par \uc2 CHILDCARE\par \par \uc2 Gloria De Piero\par \par \uc2 Shadow Women and Equalities minister\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CListening to women across every part of the country, the one thing that comes up more than anything is childcare. Where is the progress when the cost of even part-time childcare is now more than a mortgage, and women still feel they have to choose between their career and their family? That\u8217\'20\'19s why we need to expand free childcare for three- and four-year-olds and ensure access to breakfast and after-school clubs, helping women and their families.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 BRITAIN\u8217\'20\'19S YOUNG\par \par \uc2 Laura Bates\par \par \uc2 Founder of the Everyday Sexism Project\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFrom young women raising their voices to fight against female genital mutilation to students who are rebelling against a culture of misogyny at UK universities, we are seeing a real revolution as a whole new generation of young women is standing shoulder to shoulder alongside more seasoned feminists to stamp out sexism and gender imbalance, once and for all. Issues that were once dismissed and brushed under the carpet are no longer being ignored, and young people are taking the fight to a new frontier using social media to organise and campaign.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 HONOUR-BASED ABUSE\par \par \uc2 Jasvinder Sanghera\par \par \uc2 Founder of Karma Nirvana\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHonour-based abuse is what underlines all abuse: FGM, forced marriage and all the other oppressive practices. It\u8217\'20\'19s committing crimes in the name of so-called honour \u8211\'20\'13 to protect a family\u8217\'20\'19s reputation. You understand you have the power to bring shame and dishonour to your family. From eight years old, I understood I wasn\u8217\'20\'19t allowed to cut my hair, or sit in the presence of boys. I had to dress modestly and not take part in social activities that my peers took part in, like going to the school disco or going swimming. I was told it was dishonourable. Families that operate under the honour system are self-policing. You can be significantly harmed, or whipped off to Pakistan to marry somebody. They deal with the victims as they want and the world doesn\u8217\'20\'19t see it. We have come a long way when it comes to forced marriage: we have a forced marriage unit, and soon it will be a criminal offence. But where there\u8217\'20\'19s forced marriage, there\u8217\'20\'19s always honour-based abuse. I\u8217\'20\'19d like the Government to give us a definition of what it is. I\u8217\'20\'19d like to see every police force in the UK be inspected in how they deal with it and get trained.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 DETENTION OF FEMALE ASYLUM-SEEKERS\par \par \uc2 Juliet Stevenson\par \par \uc2 Actress\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a brutal, shameful aspect of government practice. For a long time, I\u8217\'20\'19ve been deeply concerned about the issue of detaining people who come to this country seeking sanctuary. We need to remind everybody that this is a legal right. Many come from an experience of extreme brutality, almost always rape and very often having had to leave children behind. They had to escape through extremely dangerous circumstances and yet, almost all of these women\u8217\'20\'19s experiences in this country are as bad and brutalising as the experience from which they fled. It\u8217\'20\'19s shocking to see how they\u8217\'20\'19re treated in Yarl\u8217\'20\'19s Wood [detention centre] when you think they haven\u8217\'20\'19t committed any crime. The Home Office is making a lot of mistakes; it has a culture of refusal \u8211\'20\'13 that\u8217\'20\'19s its default position. There\u8217\'20\'19s a culture of fear and loathing. All three parties are vying for electoral popularity, [but] it\u8217\'20\'19s urgent to separate the asylum question from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ; they\u8217\'20\'19re very different. We need to reinvest in legal aid, re-educate the Home Office and make sure these issues are separate. It\u8217\'20\'19s an inhuman system.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION (FGM)\par \par \uc2 Fahima Hashim\par \par \uc2 Director of Salmmah Women\u8217\'20\'19s Resource Centre in Sudan\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFGM takes away the dignity of a woman as a sexual being. We had a proposed law to criminalise it [in Sudan] but the article has been removed. I produced advocacy materials defining danger and consequences of FGM to a woman and gave it to the men of my family to read. On the eve of the day my cousin was going to do it to his daughters, he changed his mind. Those women are now young mothers with young ones of their own. FGM remains a big issue, but so is sexual harassment, rape and the way it\u8217\'20\'19s dealt with in society. There are violations everywhere; crimes against women and humanity. Women are lashed here for what they wear, or for adultery. Women are not given the space to exert themselves. They\u8217\'20\'19re degraded and aren\u8217\'20\'19t part of society or an agent of change. We need to provide information about sexuality and [enable] women to look at themselves as sexual beings. I\u8217\'20\'19m still hopeful. All the beautiful women in my country, including my daughter and niece, deserve to live in dignity.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN CONFLICT\par \par \uc2 Jemima Khan\par \par \uc2 Writer and Unicef ambassador\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe long-term effect of rape and abuse can be catastrophic both physically and emotionally. A recent report by the UN Secretary-General on sexual violence in conflict gives a sense of the horrifying scale of the problem \u8211\'20\'13 reporting on sexual violence from Somalia to South Sudan to Syria. In the Democratic Republic of Congo alone, approximately 1,100 rapes are reported every month, with an average of 36 women and girls raped every day. The Foreign Secretary [William Hague] has played a leading role in focusing international attention on sexual violence in conflict. We now want to see that international political will translated into practical action at the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict in London in June. The \uc2 UK Government\uc2  must ensure that global leaders commit to concrete measures to protect not only women but also children. We want child survivors of violence to have access to justice \u8211\'20\'13 to feel safe to come forward and to hold their abusers to account. The Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict is an unprecedented opportunity for change.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 DEFENDING THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT\par \par \uc2 Shami Chakrabarti\par \par \uc2 Director of Liberty\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFind me a sphere of life untainted by gender inequality and I\u8217\'20\'19ll be impressed \u8211\'20\'13 it\u8217\'20\'19s probably the biggest global injustice we face. This year an election looms, but already the gloves are off and anti-human rights rhetoric abounds. Our Human Rights Act protects women from abuses ranging from sexual assault to slavery, and we need to entrench such protections, not scrap them. If we don\u8217\'20\'19t all step up and fight for the Act this year, we may well lose it. And women will be among the hardest hit.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Thousands of women marched through the streets of central London yesterday calling for an end to violence against women. Crowds walked down Oxford Street and gathered in Trafalgar Square to hear music and speeches from activists.\par \par \uc2 The seventh annual Million Women Rise march fell on International Women's Day, seeking to highlight all forms of female exploitation and abuse in the UK and around the world.\par \par \uc2 Myriad nationalities converged on a sunny afternoon, with demonstrators decked out in colourful outfits. Beating drums and dancing, they sang: "Power to the women. Women got the power. Sister can you hear us?"\par \par \uc2 Andrea Johnstone, 50, a charity worker from Bournemouth, was marching in London for a third year. She said: "Women aren't here to be abused. That's not what we were put on the planet for." Student Phoebe Heptinstall, 18, who marched with her mother, voiced concerns about women in music videos portrayed as sex objects "as if their only worth were their tits and arse".\par \par \uc2 Demonstrators called on the Government to increase funding to female charities that look after victims of abuse and to overhaul the justice system to prosecute more male sex offenders. Other demonstrations and marches were held around the world, from Paris to Los Angeles to Sydney.\par \par \uc2 Alex Delmar-Morgan\par \par \uc2 Have you ever asked a six-year-old girl how feminism can achieve its goal? You should. The answer, it turns out, is quite simple. "Boys and girls should all be treated equally," according to Lottie Goodchild. "Some places they are, but not others. To make it equal, you've got to pass the news on. Get lots of people involved to stop this."\par \par \uc2 The young feminist, who wants to be a doctor, vet and dentist (all at the same time) when she grows up, has already done her part. She spent yesterday afternoon discussing feminism and celebrating International Women's Day at the Women of the World (WOW) Festival in London. All her fellow debaters were under 10 years old.\par \par \uc2 Activist Malala Yousafzai, fashion designer \uc2 Vivienne Westwood\uc2  and artist Grayson Perry, who are all scheduled to attend the festival this weekend, might have dominated the headlines, but it was at WOW's over-subscribed Under 10s Corner - where 15 already thoughtful girls talked while seated on brightly coloured bean bags - that the big issues were discussed.\par \par \uc2 "Are boys and girls the same?" "What does feminism mean?" "What toys do you play with?" and "What is it like in your playground?" were just some of the questions asked by playwright and poet Caroline Bird, who facilitated the event.\par \par \uc2 She was stuck by the growing awareness about equal rights among young girls. "[In some ways] they are a lot more progressive than the adults around them," she said.\par \par \uc2 One girl said she had been stopped from playing with boys in her school playground. Another said she was allowed to play with boys, but was often treated differently because she was a girl. Another had been teased for being a feminist ("The boy said I must hate boys"). But it got really heated when they were asked about toys being marketed differently for boys and girls - did you know there are boy and girl Nerf guns?\par \par \uc2 On one point there was unanimous agreement: kids should have their say. "You shouldn't have to be a certain age to care about feminism, because it's something that's wrong in the world," said eight-year-old Ella Kiely. Esme Leaman-Hill, eight, agreed. "It isn't fair for men to be better than women and to get dreams while women cook and clean."\par \par \uc2 Becky Goodchild, seven, summed it up: "They should all be good to each other. They're both equal."\par \par \uc2 Sarah Morrison\par \par \uc2 Document INDOS00020140309ea390000p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

\par\par \uc2 Editorial; Opinion, Columns\par \b \uc2 The Tories have both motive and opportunity to Taser the police [CORRECTED]\b0\par\par\uc2 ADAM BOULTON   \par \uc2 1,116 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 1; National\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Publisher Notice: The above article incorrectly states that Sir Paul Stephenson resigned as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service "for accepting favours from a former News of the World executive". We are happy to make this clear.\par \par \uc2 The British police may not be the best in the world. Twentyone years after the murder of their son Stephen by racist thugs, Doreen and Neville Lawrence have still not had justice. The home secretary Theresa May admits the initial investigation was "deeply flawed". On Thursday, announcing the findings of an inquiry by Mark Ellison QC, May told MPs that, far from catching the killers, the police sent an undercover spy into the Lawrence family camp to relay "fascinating and valuable" intelligence to the team preparing the defence of Sir Paul Condon, then Metropolitan police commissioner, against charges of incompetence or worse.\par \par \uc2 One senior officer in the counterterrorism squad is sidelined, another officer is under criminal investigation, and Ellison is investigating how many convictions may be overturned because of improper conduct by undercover officers. May said his findings were "deeply disturbing". The prime minister was very shocked. London mayor Boris Johnson called it "sickening".\par \par \uc2 All this comes as the Conservatives are talking more openly about who might be the next leader of the party. Johnson furiously dismissed speculation last week that he should return to parliament now to join \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's loyal supporters.\par \par \uc2 The mayor put the record straight directly with Cameron after last week's Westminster Abbey memorial service for Nelson Mandela. The occasion must have reminded them that Mandela was an early champion of justice for the Lawrence family, having met them in London in May 1993, a month after Stephen's murder, to back their call for prompter action by the police.\par \par \uc2 Some in City Hall believe the home secretary was burnishing her credentials as a candidate last week, with her outspoken condemnation in her Commons statement of police conduct. Certainly both the May and the Boris camps are flexing their muscles over law and order in the capital. Oversight of the Met used to reside with the home secretary but it passed to the mayor and probably represents his most significant power.\par \par \uc2 The mayor is is now responsible for the Met's priorities and performance, and, with the home secretary, appoints "Britain's top cop", the Metropolitan commissioner. Some may wonder why anyone wants that job, given the fate of recent incumbents.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after becoming mayor in 2008, Johnson ushered the Blairite Met commissioner Sir Ian Blair off the premises in the aftermath of the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005. His successor resigned after 2\u189\'00\'BD years in the job for accepting favours from a former News of the World executive.\par \par \uc2 The pressure is now on current commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who is doing all he can to prevent his future becoming a bone of contention between the mayor and the home secretary. They both put him in the job as a compromise candidate after the government's idea of bringing in an American outsider, \uc2 Bill Bratton\uc2 , the former chief of New York and Los Angeles police, ran into resistance.\par \par \uc2 Hogan-Howe has deftly bent to the whims of his rival bosses. He backed the mayor on water cannon for the Met and supports May on curbs to stop-andsearch powers, a matter on which she is still in dispute with \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 . Black people are seven times more likely than whites to be stopped by the police. The home secretary argues that this is both an inefficient way of fighting crime and carries the whiff of "institutional racism" first put in common parlance by the Macpherson inquiry into police handling of the Lawrence murder.\par \par \uc2 Home secretary, commissioner and mayor are united in the view that the Met must be made to look more representative of diverse London, but accept that the practical transformation of the police profile has barely begun.\par \par \uc2 Hogan-Howe describes the revelations of police spying and corruption as the worst day of his career and pledged to reform the Met. The mayor was noticeably warmer towards the commissioner than May, insisting that he was "absolutely ... right to be ruthless in pursuing all suggestions of past misconduct and corruption".\par \par \uc2 Boris and May serve different constituencies and so diverge on key questions. The home secretary, for example, chooses to talk and act tough on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and deportation because she has inoculated herself against accusations of primitivism by her stands on stop-andsearch and justice for the Lawrences. Boris is tied to the performance of his police force and needs to hug it close, but the Conservative party has distanced itself. "We don't go around saying the police are the backbone of the nation any more," one Cameronite commented.\par \par \uc2 On questions such as pay, pensions, and absenteeism, the government sees the police as just another awkward manifestation of the public sector. May is seizing on police errors to force reforms, using the Lawrence revelations to introduce an offence of "police corruption". The Conservative party increasingly shares this suspicious approach to the forces of law and order. David Davis has led the attack on the Met and the Police Federation over the Andrew Mitchell affair. Jacob Rees-Mogg has called for Hogan-Howe's resignation.\par \par \uc2 Mitchell's tribulations should not be overestimated in all this. He has been vindicated in two important side issues: the serving police officer's false claim to have witnessed his "pleb" row as a passer-by, and the attempt by Police Federation activists to misrepresent a meeting with him. Yet the question of what Mitchell said to the police at the No 10 gate remains unresolved after investigation by the cabinet secretary, the police and the \uc2 Crown Prosecution Service\uc2 . The libel case brought by PC Toby Rowland against Mitchell may settle it.\par \par \uc2 These are just a few of the problems piling up in Hogan-Howe's in-tray. The \uc2 Independent Police Complaints Commission\uc2  is looking into his role at the Hillsborough disaster when an inspector in the South Yorkshire constabulary. MPs are challenging the veracity of police crime statistics. Internal Met investigations report "endemic corruption" by organised crime.\par \par \uc2 By far the most serious are the issues raised by the inquiries into the Lawrence case and the use and abuse of undercover agents. They didn't happen on Hogan-Howe's watch but he has pledged to clear up the mess. Cameron and May say he has set himself a massive task. If he fails, they'll know who to blame, and it won't be them.\par \par \uc2 @adamboultonsky\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140309ea39000q7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

And there is no doubt about it. The fight is now on for the future of our continent."\par \par \uc2 He referred to the electoral successes of France's Front National, the Netherlands' PVV party and Greece's Golden Dawn as examples of this.\par \par \uc2 And though he did not include Ukip in this definition, he said: "An ungenerous, backwards looking politics has emerged in Britain." Referring to Ukip's leader Nigel Farage, he added: "The politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub."\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg and his Lib Dem colleagues have sought to turn May's European elections into a straight fight between them and Ukip, arguing they are the only two parties with a clear strategy on Europe. Mr Clegg and Mr Farage will hold a live debate on Britain's membership of the EU just weeks before the ballot.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dem leader argued that his pro-European stance was more democratic than that of more eurosceptic parties, saying: "I love Britain... I love that, while we may be an island, we have always looked beyond our shores." He called his party "the guardians of a modern, open and tolerant Britain".\par \par \uc2 Lib Dem ministers have been pushing an openly pro-EU, pro-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  platform. They include Ed Davey, the energy secretary, who told the BBC's \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show his party wanted to increase \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  by relaxing visa restrictions on \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 ' extended families.\par \par \uc2 Mr Davey said: "Where family life is involved, where it is someone's family life, where it is someone's husband or wife, I do think we should be more welcoming."\par \par \uc2 MPs and advisers admit the strategy is risky, but say that with the party at risk of losing all its MEPs in May, it has to try a change of tack. "These positions might often be thought unpopular," said one official. "But there is nothing to lose now. We might as well make a virtue of who we are."\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020140309ea39000p2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Political risk on agenda in UK boardrooms\b0\par\par\uc2 By Brian Groom, Business and Employment Editor   \par \uc2 579 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2014\par 14:21\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd.

On issues from energy prices to the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate, to the referendums on Scottish independence and EU membership, business leaders feel under pressure.\par \par \uc2 "Politicians of all persuasions are swinging about," said a FTSE 100 chief executive. "All they want to do is create something for the moment, but where will that leave us in 10 to 15 years' time?"\par \par \uc2 In interviews with the Financial Times, big company bosses expressed anxiety that the febrile climate 14 months off a general election could drive investors away.\par \par \uc2 Much of their concern is focused on Ed Miliband, the Labour party leader, who has set himself up as champion of the "little guy" in pledging to freeze energy bills and criticising banks, housebuilders. insurance companies, betting groups and pension providers.\par \par \uc2 "I do feel that the prospect of Miliband gaining power on the basis of what he is saying is a dangerous thing, and very negative," said a leading FTSE chairman, though he added: "It is so difficult to know whether the rhetoric is reality."\par \par \uc2 Many are sore, too, about Labour's plan raise the top income tax rate from 45p to 50p. The party is heading towards the election with little big business support, though it has a better chance with smaller companies.\par \par \uc2 However, "political risk is not all on the Labour side", said a FTSE 100 chief in the finance sector. He criticised the coalition for a "debacle" over airport development, "terrible" inconsistency on energy subsidies and a "complete failure to deal with planning".\par \par \uc2 Others fear the Conservatives' \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  controls will hold back recovery by restricting the employment of people from outside the EU to meet skills shortages. Some are nervous about Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's plan for an EU membership referendum by 2017 - "an unnecessary risk", said one foreign investor.\par \par \uc2 A Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition is seen by some bosses as worse for them than a Labour government. "It could have a compounding effect," reinforcing anti-business tendencies on both sides, said a chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Another said that even if Nick Clegg, the right-leaning leader, and Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander remained at the top of the party, "they would not be in the ascendancy in a Lab-Lib coalition. It would be the Vince Cable-Simon Hughes faction."\par \par \uc2 One chairman worried about a coalition led by Mr Miliband and Mr Cable, saying the Lib Dem business secretary was "much more dangerous [than Mr Miliband]. He would want to do lots of the 'stop the rich' stuff, such as levying a mansion tax."\par \par \uc2 Many agree business has helped bring the hostile climate on itself. "Business has to think deeply about its role in society," said a FTSE boss in financial services. "A lot of companies have ignored the consumer."\par \par \uc2 Executives are trying to assess what a Labour victory would mean. Housebuilders say that since Mr Miliband's broadside against them for "hoarding" land, "the tone has been a lot less confrontational", in meetings with Labour's housing policy team.\par \par \uc2 Some FTSE bosses think, even if Mr Miliband lives up to his rhetoric, the markets will rein him in. "One thing that has changed since the 1970s is the global markets' speed of reaction," said a chairman. "In France, President Hollande has had to change course more rapidly than Mitterrand did."\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Andy Sharman\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020140309ea39001b9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Leader Pages\par \b \uc2 Leading Article: Ukip: Revolt of the dispossessed\b0\par\par\uc2 713 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 28\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Some thought they were hearing Hugh Grant in Love Actually, but perhaps another influence was Elizabeth Barrett Browning. "How do I love thee?" she asked in a famous poem. "Let me count the ways." Yesterday Nick Clegg offered his party's spring conference - and beyond it, the wider electorate - a list of 16 or 17 ways, depending on how you count, in which he Loved Britain, invoking such different British enthusiasms as human rights and gay marriage, the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and the shipping forecast, royal babies and Private Eye.\par \par \uc2 Like all such speeches, it required some bashing of Labour and the Conservatives, but his sights were also plainly set on a certain unnamed Mr Farage. Mr Clegg wants us to know that, as a patriot, he stands for what he defines as a moderate, open, tolerant Britain - where Ukip by implication stands for a swath of opinion that believes that moderation and tolerance need to be reined back; a priority that may well reflect the findings in the morning's Sunday Times poll, which had Ukip on 14% of the vote and the Lib Dems behind on 10%.\par \par \uc2 How seriously should we take the rise of Ukip since Mr Farage took over? A book that examines the party's nature, Revolt on the Right: Explaining Public Support for the Radical Right in Britain, by Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford, comes out this week: the Guardian ran a piece based on it last Thursday. Some readers doubt if Ukip is worth such attention. There's a history of political parties that blossom, but fade away when the pressure is on. It didn't take long for even the SDP to cease to look like the future and begin to look like the past. New parties may especially flourish in contests where turnouts are low, because their supporters alone are highly motivated. Always look at the share a party takes of the total electorate as well as its share of the poll. Even Ukip's eye-catching 24% of the vote at the South Shields byelection last year was built on the backing of a mere 9.5% of the electorate.\par \par \uc2 Yet even new-party sceptics need to pay heed to the nature of their support, as analysed in this book. It's too easy to suppose that Ukip is essentially a refuge for discontented Conservatives, desperate for their party to get tougher on Europe, tougher on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , and tougher on most other things too. But what it preaches echoes the mood of former Labour voters as well. Ukip under Mr Farage has established itself as the voice of the dispossessed: people who sense that their neighbourhoods, their cultures, their country, have been stolen from them. "They feel," these authors say, "like strangers in a society whose ruling elites do not talk like them, or value the things that matter to them."\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is the obvious scapegoat, as it has always been for people who feel that way. But in relative strongholds such as Lincolnshire - far away from the centre of events, and far away also from the benefits of an economic recovery that is skewed towards London and the south-east - the conviction that the country is being run overwhelmingly in the interests of the comfortable classes of the capital and its hinterland is a powerful ingredient too.\par \par \uc2 Free from the fear of having one day to practise what he's been preaching, Mr Farage articulates what they feel, and is consequently judged to be honest in a way that mainstream politicians are not. Where Mr Clegg is keen to enshrine the Liberal Democrats as a party of government, for many of the dispossessed, a "party of government" defines precisely what they are most against.\par \par \uc2 The fundamental instincts of Ukip supporters, as set out by Mr Goodwin and Mr Ford, will have little appeal for Guardian readers. But a moderate, open and tolerant Britain ought to acknowledge that the fears and discontents of these dispossessed deserve to be given a hearing. Better to have them investing in their own way in the broad democratic process than joining the ranks of that steadily growing political grouping, the Why Bothers, also known as the Will Not Votes.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140309ea3a0002a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A leading member of the UK Independence party, which has railed against the European "gravy train", has demanded its MEPs contribute pounds 10,000 each from their parliamentary allowances and salaries towards the costs of the party's British headquarters or risk being deselected.\par \par \uc2 Alan Bown, a party donor who sits on its national executive committee, wrote to Ukip representatives in Brussels in 2011 suggesting they should be "good value for money" and divert EU cash to the party's headquarters or face the sack, according to leaked documents. He pointedly added that thousands of pounds of EU allowances could be claimed without submitting receipts.\par \par \uc2 Party leader Nigel Farage and the party's national executive committee subsequently put pressure on the MEPs to pay more to support the running of the party, sources said. Ukip sources say MEPs are still placed under "immense pressure" to contribute to the party.\par \par \uc2 Bown's proposals prompted a furious response from the party's MEPs, who feared they would be at risk of breaking the law if they diverted funds. Another leaked email shows that the party's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  spokesman, Gerard Batten, warned Ukip officials that he and other MEPs could face jail if they carried out Bown's demands.\par \par \uc2 The disclosures are confirmation that the party's MEPs have been under increasing pressure to divert their allowances into the party's UK operations.\par \par \uc2 EU documents state that allowances "are only eligible when spent on activities and objects which are directly linked to the office of a member of the European parliament". Bown, a former bookmaker, sent an email to national executive members in January 2011 with an attached document titled "MEPs' Financial Contributions to the Party".\par \par \uc2 He complained that MEPs had failed to contribute to the party and pointed out that it costs pounds 125,000 to get each of them elected, questioning whether they were good value for money.\par \par \uc2 Arguing that the party's headquarters, Lexdrum House in Devon, spends a lot of money getting MEPs elected, he added: "In my opinion the MEP's have a clear duty to help finance Lexdrum House."\par \par \uc2 The email points out that to get on a Ukip selection list, MEP candidates have to sign a "code of conduct" document complying with Bown's demand that MEPs "provide substantial financial support to the central Party out of income".\par \par \uc2 A version of the code of conduct from 2008 has been leaked to the Guardian. It says the party's MEPs pledge to "submit to oversight and act on advice from the party regarding the use of parliament allowances and expenses".\par \par \uc2 In his email, Bown, 71, says: "Most MEPs draw a salary of pounds 80K+ per year plus generous expenses of approximately pounds 320K some of which does not require receipts."\par \par \uc2 He said he had spoken to fellow Ukip peer and former party leader Lord Pearson and suggested he had agreed that this year's reselected candidates should be judged in part on their payments to the party. "Before an MEP is allowed to stand for re-election for 2014, the NEC should look at their record over the previous 5 years to see what he or she had achieved and particularly their financial contributions to the Party. The NEC reserves the right to blackball any MEP from standing again if their record was poor."\par \par \uc2 Bown's email prompted an angry response from a number of MEPs, insiders said. A few days later, Batten sent an email claiming that following Bown's advice would risk a criminal record and jail.\par \par \uc2 "The staff and office allowance combined is pounds 253k," said Batten. "This money can only be spent according to the rules on staff and offices. Only pounds 42k of that does not require 'receipts'. To use it for personal or political purposes is against the rules. Are you suggesting we should use it illegally? Are you suggesting we should risk prison to help the Party financially?"\par \par \uc2 Two weeks after the email exchange, some MEPs met Bown, Farage and Stuart Wheeler and were informed that they were each under pressure to increase contributions to the party.\par \par \uc2 A Ukip spokesman said: "All of our MEPs conduct their financial affairs honestly and comply with the rules covering allowances and expenses. Any donations they make to the party come from their post-tax salaries." Bown did not respond to requests for a comment.\par \par \uc2 Alan Bown has suggested that MEPs' record of contributions to party funds be vetted before they are reselected\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140309ea3a0002u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News | CLEGG'S BRITAIN\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg has his work cut out convincing us that he is an ordinary British bloke. He's got the Everyman accent, to be sure, but his blood is a heady cocktail of Russian, German, Polish, Ukrainian and Dutch, with a late tincture of English. He speaks several languages, and he is married to a Spaniard. On top of all that he's not only relaxed about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , but positively enthusiastic about the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So it is understandable that he should wish to remind the nation that he is not only British to the core, but proud to be so. Hence the long encomium for all things Brit in his speech yesterday.\par \par \uc2 Britain, he said, is as modest as it is proud, as inventive as it is conservative, as irreverent as it is obsequious. We love to queue even when there is no call to do so, and we believe a cup of tea is the solution to every problem.\par \par \uc2 Of course most of these distinctions could be cited to underline the argument that we are in fact the strangest nation on earth: listening to the shipping forecast 100 miles inland, sunbathing in the freezing cold\u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 The speech gave one the feeling of eavesdropping at breakfast with Miriam. Nick certainly makes a good stab at keeping his end up - but where will they go for their holidays?\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140310ea3a0000s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Business\par \par \uc2 If you took a drive last year out of San Francisco down Highway 101 towards Silicon Valley, you would have sped past a giant billboard emblazoned with a huge red maple leaf. Its sales pitch, "H-1B Problems? Pivot to Canada", was an appeal to international entrepreneurs who have moved to Silicon Valley but run into problems with the US's H-1B visa programme for high-skilled workers.\par \par \uc2 The billboard was paid for by the \uc2 Canadian government\uc2 , which hopes those frustrated entrepreneurs will relocate north of the border. To encourage them - and other high-skilled foreign citizens - to do so, it has been offering permanent residence to entrepreneurs who speak English or French, have completed at least one year of college, and can show they can raise funding for their business ventures.\par \par \uc2 Canada's Start-Up Visa is not a million miles away from the UK's Tier 1 Entrepreneur Visa programme, which sets similar requirements. But in Britain, we offer only a temporary permit to live and work in the UK, at least initially.\par \par \uc2 A report by the independent Centre for Entrepreneurs illustrates why it is foolhardy to put obstacles in the way of these people. One in seven UK companies was set up by a migrant, it reveals, and migrant-founded companies create 14 per cent of all jobs at small and medium-sized companies. In the UK's migrant community, 17.2 per cent of people have launched their own businesses, compared to only 10.4 per cent of people born in the UK. Migrant entrepreneurs also tend to be younger.\par \par \uc2 The implication is clear. If Britain wants to foster an entrepreneurial economy, which is crucial for job creation, we should be doing everything we can to attract potential founders of new businesses to this country. \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  are coming here to make our jobs, not take them.\par \par \uc2 The Government is doing more than you might think in this regard. As well as the Entrepreneur Visa, different arms of government are involved in specific projects such as the Sirius Programme, run by \uc2 UK Trade & Investment\uc2 , which offers international graduates financial and practical support with getting a business off the ground in Britain. Successful applicants have begun working with business accelerator programmes around the country and qualify for up to \u163\'00\'A312,000 of financial assistance, plus a mentoring programme and visa endorsement. More than 1,500 graduate entrepreneurs from 93 countries enrolled in Sirius in its first year.\par \par \uc2 It may be some time before the fruits of this labour are quantifiable, but the work done by the Centre for Entrepreneurs suggests we need more of these programmes - and much less of the toxic rhetoric that surrounds the debate over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Why move to Britain to start your business when you'll have to put up with this sort of nonsense when you could just as easily move to, say, Canada and be welcomed with open arms?\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140310ea3a0001h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 There are some slightly less nefarious reasons for flying on a stolen passport\b0\par\par\uc2 SIMON CALDER TRAVEL CORRESPONDENT   \par \uc2 428 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par \uc2 The Independent\par \uc2 IND\par \uc2 1ST\par 4,5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 News | Comment\par \par \uc2 Identity misrepresentation is rife among air travellers - yet often the motive is simply to save cash by otherwise law-abiding citizens.\par \par \uc2 Suppose Traveller A has booked a Gatwick-Glasgow flight weeks ahead for \u163\'00\'A340, but can no longer fly. Traveller B needs to make the same trip at short notice and faces a far higher fare. They may make a deal, at the expense of the airline.\par \par \uc2 In the 20th century, as long as they were approximately the same gender, B would simply masquerade as A. Today, it's only slightly more complicated. For many flights within the UK, airline staff do not insist on ID. Even when they do, flimsy proof such as a railcard may suffice - as long as the name corresponds to the booking and the photo looks like you. Now, you could today buy a "Two Together" Railcard bearing the names Vladimir Putin and Angela Merkel but the pictures of you and a friend, and use it as ID for a domestic flight booked in the name of the Russian President and/or German Chancellor. So the passenger in the next seat may not be the person named on the ticket.\par \par \uc2 Rules for international travel are tighter, making identity theft more the preserve of organised crime intent on serious mischief. Stolen passports are at the heart of ID fraud, with voracious demand from drug-traffickers and people-smugglers matched by a reliable supply from petty criminals who rob tourists and business travellers. Criminal craftsmen are adept at replacing photographs beneath the laminate on the personal details page - which is why increased security measures now include a second, embedded, image. As the MH370 tragedy has shown, intelligence on fake identities is not routinely shared internationally. When I renewed my passport some years ago, the document was "lost" in the post. It later turned up in the possession of an American villain. Ever since, when I arrive at US Immigration I am hauled off to "Secondary" for hours of further investigation. But other countries are uninterested in my apparently nefarious past.\par \par \uc2 The pair who departed Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on Saturday using stolen passports took advantage of the lack of international co-operation on ID fraud. But that doesn't mean they were to blame for downing the plane. They may simply have been illegal economic migrants to Europe, flying to Amsterdam via China simply to get a cheap fare - and therefore not-quite-innocent victims.\par \par \uc2 Document IND0000020140310ea3a00021\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Families\par \b \uc2 Three Pounds in my Pocket: my father and the first Asians in Britain\b0\par\par\uc2 Kavita Puri   \par \uc2 1,595 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par 00:01\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19d heard many \u163\'00\'A33 tales throughout my childhood. Stories of starting a life with nearly nothing. Of the women who sewed money into the lining of their saris to smuggle a little extra cash into the country. Or the taxi drivers at Heathrow fleecing new Indian arrivals for a quick trip to Southall, despite knowing they all arrived with \u163\'00\'A33. The stories seemed slightly preposterous. I mean, how could you start a new life in a new country with so little?\par \par \uc2 It was during a funeral that I realised the stories could be true. A family friend began paying tribute to his father by talking about how much he had achieved given that he came to Britain with just \u163\'00\'A33 in his pocket. I realised it wasn\u8217\'20\'19t just a family myth and that I needed to find out more about these postwar arrivals from the Indian subcontinent who, unlike the Windrush generation, are a strangely forgotten part of history. Before the last of that pioneering generation passed away I decided to make a Radio 4 documentary about my findings.\par \par \uc2 In the 1950s, the \uc2 UK Government\uc2  opened its doors to Commonwealth citizens and a generation of young men from the Indian subcontinent came to Britain to seek their fortune. They were needed to help to rebuild the economy after the Second World War through working in factories, foundries and public services. But there was a snag. Those coming from India could bring only \u163\'00\'A33 \u8212\'20\'14 equivalent to \u163\'00\'A350 today. Like most developing countries, India faced an extreme shortage of foreign currency, so rationed it with a strict quota. Those young men who arrived with a suitcase and a few pounds could never have imagined that one day they would break long-established racial boundaries \u8212\'20\'14 many of those I interviewed would go on to become pillars of the British establishment.\par \par \uc2 My father, Ravi Datt Puri, a pure-maths graduate from New Delhi, was one of them. He arrived in November 1959, aged 24. He\u8217\'20\'19d tired of his job working for \uc2 Pfizer\uc2  in India and was lured by an attractive graduate traineeship at a well-known engineering company in Middlesbrough. He imagined Britain \u8220\'20\'1Cwould be very nice, posh, clean, tidy and wherever you go it would be fantastic, but I was disappointed. The buses were exactly the same as they were in Bombay."\par \par \uc2 Arriving at Heathrow airport, he was expecting to meet a family friend who would take him to Middlesbrough. But the friend was out on a date and my dad had to make his way alone to Yorkshire. Waiting on a platform at King\u8217\'20\'19s Cross station on a winter evening, he was bitterly cold. He had no overcoat, having been told by his family that he wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t need one. From his one suitcase he took out a brown dressing gown that he\u8217\'20\'19d recently bought in Kashmir. He wore it on the platform while waiting for his train. He only took it off once he arrived at the home of his English landlady in Middlesbrough. Not surprisingly, my father soon developed a raging fever. It rained non-stop for days while he was recovering. In one of his first letters home he wrote: \u8220\'20\'1CIt is nearly a week now and I have noticed the sun never rises in the British Empire."\par \par \uc2 Unlike the Windrush generation, the postwar arrivals from the Indian subcontinent are a largely forgotten part of history. Dr Florian Stadtler, from the University of Exeter and co-author of Asian Britain, explains this anomaly. \u8220\'20\'1CThere was no Windrush moment. That\u8217\'20\'19s why the process of South Asian migration, particularly pre-1960, has fallen under the historical radar."\par \par \uc2 Mohammed Ajeeb came from Mirpur, Pakistan in 1957. Like most men at the time he came in search of a better life and to provide for his family back home. He arrived with \u163\'00\'A35 \u8212\'20\'14 as the Pakistani authorities allowed you to bring a few pounds extra. He recalls: \u8220\'20\'1CYou could not expect any better jobs than all the jobs refused by the white people; the most dirty, difficult and dangerous jobs." Paula Sanghera was 2 when she came to Coventry in 1953 with her mother, to join her father who\u8217\'20\'19d arrived three years earlier. At that time it was extremely unusual for families to join the men in Britain. Her father worked at the Sterling Metal foundry and she remembers how he would come home on his bike \u8220\'20\'1Cin the evening covered in dirt. He worked on the furnace. It was the worst job in the foundry and I can actually remember him coughing up blood. He couldn\u8217\'20\'19t speak English, he couldn\u8217\'20\'19t read or write and that was the best job he was capable of getting."\par \par \uc2 Kulwant Selhi came here by ship from Bombay in 1954 when he was 18. Luckily for him he arrived with \u163\'00\'A317. He\u8217\'20\'19d paid a shilling to enter a competition to guess the speed of the ship to England and won. He arrived at Tilbury docks on November 5. Walking off the ship there were fireworks and he assumed the British must celebrate Diwali. He came to Britain to join his father who was working at the Indian High Commission. His father wanted him to learn \u8220\'20\'1CBritish ways". These men in the 1950s had been born during the British Raj. The idea that they could pay the British, in their own country, to do menial things for them, was unimaginable. Selhi remembers going to Charing Cross to have his shoes shined so his brother could \u8220\'20\'1Ctake my picture. I wanted to send it to India to show that the English people are polishing my shoes."\par \par \uc2 For many years, I\u8217\'20\'19d hesitated to ask my father of his early days here. I was afraid he\u8217\'20\'19d tell me stories of bitter racism. He genuinely can\u8217\'20\'19t recall any in Middlesbrough. It is kindness he remembers. He had a good boss, Vincent Thompson, whom my father describes as a \u8220\'20\'1Cgodfather". A month after my father arrived in England, Thompson invited him to join his family for Christmas lunch so he wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be alone. He went every year after that, long after he\u8217\'20\'19d left the company, and until I was born.\par \par \uc2 At the beginning of the 1950s there were only 43,000 people from the Indian subcontinent in Britain. They were greeted with curiosity. Selhi was the only Indian in Charlton, South London, in the mid-1950s and remembers the children following him around the street, thinking his turban meant he was a Maharajah. Sanghera remembers her English neighbours in Coventry asking where her family came from and why they were here. \u8220\'20\'1CI would make up all these stories: my mum and dad were a prince and princess in exile. We haven\u8217\'20\'19t got many things because they were chucked out of their kingdom." These stories her neighbours believed.\par \par \uc2 But there was racism. Ajeeb\u8217\'20\'19s first house was in Nottingham; 28 men lived there. He recalls sometimes there were four in one bed, with day and night shifts. \u8220\'20\'1CThe conditions were atrocious," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CAfter six months half of us caught TB because of the overcrowding and lack of fresh air". They lived like this because of the low rent, but also because \u8220\'20\'1Cthe white people didn\u8217\'20\'19t want us. In the shop windows the adverts were placed freely, saying: \u8216\'20\'18No blacks, no dogs, no Irish\u8217\'20\'19." In those days Asians were classified as blacks and it wasn\u8217\'20\'19t illegal to discriminate on the grounds of race, ethnicity or nationality in housing until 1968.\par \par \uc2 At the beginning of the 1960s the number of migrants from the Indian subcontinent had risen to 112,000. Amid much public anxiety about the arrival of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from the former colonies, the Government imposed restrictions on new entrants. Gurparshad Bance travelled in 1954, aged 13, from Ambala in Haryana state to Shoreditch. His father wanted him to come to get a good education. He remembers towards the late 1950s a shift in attitudes as attacks increased in East London. One day he was hurt, not only for being Indian, but also for wearing a turban. \u8220\'20\'1CThe English boys, they grabbed me and said: \u8216\'20\'18Why you wearing this? You got a sore head?\u8217\'20\'19 They keep calling you a black dog or they took your turban off. We went through a lot of things."\par \par \uc2 Not one of these men thought they would stay. Ajeeb remembers crying at night, wanting to go back. But he made a pact with himself: \u8220\'20\'1CI will succeed in this country by hook or by crook." My father only planned on being here two years \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1CI am still here," he says. Once the pioneer men decided to stay their wives joined them, many arriving in the 1960s.\par \par \uc2 These forgotten stories are part of British history. These early pioneers paved the way for the three million Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis who live in Britain today. Of these men, Ajeeb became the first Asian Lord Mayor in Britain, Bance a successful businessman, Selhi a college lecturer and Sanghera a deputy headteacher. My own father finished a PhD and became a prize-winning engineer. Not bad for \u163\'00\'A33.\par \par \uc2 Three Pounds in My Pocket is a three-part series. Listen to the first episode today at 5pm on BBC Asian Network. Listen to episodes two and three at 11am on Friday March 14 and 21 on Radio 4. The whole series will also be available on iPlayer.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140310ea3a000s3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Families\par \b \uc2 Here\u8217\'20\'19s why the posh London set all want an Aussie nanny; David Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s choice reflects a trend to be seen across the capital. So why are English girls not good enough?\b0\par\par\uc2 Damian Whitworth   \par \uc2 1,683 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par 00:01\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate has taken one of its stranger turns with calls for David Cameron to explain why he employed an Australian nanny rather than a British one. Talk to weary veterans of the childcare market, however, and they would wonder why he hadn\u8217\'20\'19t done it sooner. An informal survey suggests that most parents can\u8217\'20\'19t (or won\u8217\'20\'19t) afford a British nanny and, given a choice, nine out of ten would go for an Aussie. And if you can\u8217\'20\'19t get one of those a Kiwi will do.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey speak the language and are generally can-do and energetic, and very practical ," says one North London mother who has hired British nannies but swears by the athletic girl from the Outback who looked after her daughter while she was working long office days. \u8220\'20\'1CAustralians come on two-year visas and they live in your house because they want to save every penny and \u8216\'20\'18do Europe\u8217\'20\'19 while they are here. They knuckle down and work because they don\u8217\'20\'19t want the hassle of looking for another job. And they aren\u8217\'20\'19t looking for promotion or a new career. English nannies are always looking to up their status."\par \par \uc2 We don\u8217\'20\'19t know why Cameron employed an Australian woman. Probably she was simply the best candidate that he and Samantha interviewed. But there are some very good reasons why British families rely on an international brigade of nannies and carers.\par \par \uc2 For a start British nannies are expensive. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople get the best person they can get with the money available. Childcare is very expensive in the UK and in London in particular," says Fiona Neill, the author of What the Nanny Saw. \u8220\'20\'1CA top nanny costs a lot. A really good, well-educated, fully trained British nanny can cost \u163\'00\'A360,000 a year and that is a lot of money for any family. Only UHNWIs [ultra high-net-worth individuals] are going to pay that."\par \par \uc2 Often these are foreign families living in London who want an English-speaking nanny. \u8220\'20\'1CThey have homes that are the modern equivalent of Downton Abbey with a Filipino housekeeper, a gardener, a driver and a handyman. An English nanny is a brand, so in that sense it is a nanny\u8217\'20\'19s market. They are unaffordable for English people."\par \par \uc2 As well as cost there is the small matter of the job description, Neill says. \u8220\'20\'1CLots of people have Filipino nannies who are also housekeepers. Some foreign nannies are more amenable to doing more mundane domestic tasks. British nannies won\u8217\'20\'19t do that \u8212\'20\'14 not out of a sense of entitlement, but because they don\u8217\'20\'19t consider it part of their job description. They will do things that are childcare related but they won\u8217\'20\'19t do things that a housekeeper or a cleaning lady would do."\par \par \uc2 A mother-of-three in Camden says she found herself competing against neighbours for the services of a Norland nanny. She won the battle but says: \u8220\'20\'1CWhen you are trying to get a top-notch British nanny it is the inverse of the normal relationship. When they come for the interview they are interviewing you. They are visiting five or six families and choosing their employer. This is based on salary and what other perks you are offering such as gym membership or use of a car, but also whether they think you are going to be interfering in the way they look after the children. They don\u8217\'20\'19t want to kowtow to the parents on matters like discipline."\par \par \uc2 Sometimes ambitious nannies select a family that will provide the right challenges, such as looking after three children or children under school age, which they can then put on their CV. Foreign nannies, however, \u8220\'20\'1Cmostly just want a job and will do what you ask them to do; they accept a broader job description. They might not scrub the floors but they will tidy up and wait in for the \uc2 Ocado\uc2  delivery. A British nanny might do that but they will let you know that they have done it as a favour."\par \par \uc2 We British can get ourselves in a terrible, angst-ridden, class-conscious tangle when it comes to hiring people. \u8220\'20\'1CEmploying people from abroad sits more easily with your liberal sensibilities," a South London mother says. With British employees it can feel more awkward.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s easier to tell someone foreign to do more," says an East London mother of two with a demanding media job. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s our awkwardness about the feeling of employing servants. You just feel more comfortable telling a Bulgarian to empty the dishwasher. It feels more awkward with an English girl and they seem less ready to do it. The Filipinos on the other hand go the whole way and do everything."\par \par \uc2 Many British nannies see caring for children as treading water until something better comes along. Neill observes that students and graduates, who used to work as nannies a generation ago, are now being hired as tutors.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI had one nanny who wanted to be a child psychologist; this was just a second job for her," the East London mother says. \u8220\'20\'1CAnother wanted to be an actress. It\u8217\'20\'19s an insecure feeling with someone like that. You want someone who will be there for a while and build a relationship with your children."\par \par \uc2 Even career nannies can come with an unsettling attitude. \u8220\'20\'1CWe had a fully qualified Welsh nanny who claimed to have looked after the children of a famous pop star and cost an absolute fortune," the woman from South London says. \u8220\'20\'1CIt turned out that for her everything was too much trouble. She had been doing it for years but she had an ideological problem with people who were rich enough to employ nannies, which is not an ideal starting point if you want to be a nanny." Since then she has had 14 nannies and au pairs \u8220\'20\'1Cof every nationality and religion". The best? \u8220\'20\'1CThe Eastern Europeans are unbelievable: they work so hard. The Germans are a bit stern but generally very good."\par \par \uc2 Almost a match, in fact, for the Aussie nannies. \u8220\'20\'1CWe had a wonderful British nanny for years and she travelled round the world with us," says one globe-trotting businessman now settled in North London. \u8220\'20\'1CBut British nannies are quite expensive so meanly we went for the cheaper option. We had a succession of Australian nannies, each more muscular than the next. We both travel a lot for work at short notice and they lived in and were always there, able to paint toenails and talk about cricket."\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMy Australian nanny was unfazed by wildlife," says the North London mother happily. \u8220\'20\'1CWe had mice. She was used to ensuring rats didn\u8217\'20\'19t get into the house back home. The other thing about Australians is that their grammar tends to be better than British nannies. The only slight irritation is that my daughter keeps saying \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19m good\u8217\'20\'19 all the time, which drives me slightly mad."\par \par \uc2 Any nanny will do, as long as you get on\par \par \uc2 Without Filipinas to do the cleaning and Eastern Europeans or Antipodeans to look after childcare, it\u8217\'20\'19s fair to say that my neighbourhood would grind to a halt as mothers checked themselves, all making Munch\u8217\'20\'19s scream-face, into the Priory.\par \par \uc2 After all, most households in Notting Hill comprise a high-rolling daddy, a highly educated yummy mummy, a litter of children (four is the minimum), a nanny, a housekeeper, and a tutor \u8212\'20\'14 with invariably only the last speaking English as a first language because all four children have to get into St Paul\u8217\'20\'19s or Westminster or heads will roll.\par \par \uc2 When I was working and breeding at the same time, I could only afford an English nanny when I was at the Financial Times and had only one placid baby boy. I inherited her \u8212\'20\'14 and I can\u8217\'20\'19t resist putting this in \u8212\'20\'14 from Mr and Mrs Martin Amis, whose two boys were past the nanny stage.\par \par \uc2 Nadine was a vegan from Nottingham, which meant that most of our time was spent worrying about the ingestion of animal products, but she was tremendous and we loved her even if she was expensive, because she was English. But as good nannies go, 14 months after she arrived she sensibly went, after the arrival of my daughter.\par \par \uc2 After that, broken and broke, I had a score of au pairs, mothers\u8217\'20\'19 helps, and live-ins, and my childcare was like cheap honey \u8212\'20\'14 the product of many countries. A Colombian, an Irishwoman, a Slovakian, a Moldovan who was using her nanny bedroom as a knocking shop, and Karolina, who went home to Warsaw one Christmas and was then detained on her return in Calais by the \uc2 UK Border Agency\uc2 . Poles were not allowed to be au pairs in the UK in 1999. I went to France to try to spring her. My last sight of Karolina was through my tears, standing in the rain, by the detention centre.\par \par \uc2 The years passed and eventually, after a score of nannies, I could manage just with \u8220\'20\'1Cmannies" in the summer. Disregarding the gender-equality laws, I would advertise \u8212\'20\'14 but only for male Aussies or Kiwis who could drive and surf. My heart soared when these tall, sun-bronzed young men strolled into our life, often carrying guitars, the Jack Johnson songbook and surfboards, and whatever I asked them to do, however awful, they would reply, \u8220\'20\'1CNo wucking furries mate."\par \par \uc2 The thing is, when you need a nanny, it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t matter what nationality the nanny is. It\u8217\'20\'19s whether you can live with her, she with you, and whether she will be kind and loving to your children. I quite sympathise with politicians\u8217\'20\'19 nanny-gates because I\u8217\'20\'19ve been there myself, and every day I thank God I don\u8217\'20\'19t need \u8220\'20\'1Chelp" (not of that sort anyway) any more.\par \par \uc2 Rachel Johnson\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140310ea3a000s8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

The Liberal Democrat leader closed his party\u8217\'20\'19s spring conference with a call to arms. There was a delusional moment when he described the European elections as a battle between UKIP and his party. That\u8217\'20\'19ll be news to Ed Miliband, whose poll support is currently four times Mr Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s in those elections.\par \par \uc2 That was nothing compared with Mr Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s pitch for the general election. Apparently, everything that has gone well since 2010 is solely down to the Lib Dems. And the bad things? You\u8217\'20\'19ve guessed it \u8212\'20\'14 done by the Tories when he wasn\u8217\'20\'19t looking.\par \par \uc2 Unbelievable. It\u8217\'20\'19s an \u224\'00\'E0 la carte approach to government. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19ll have the tax allowances with a serving of apprenticeships and a side order of increased pension . . . And, no thanks, no bedroom tax or tuition fees today." It was there this weekend in Danny Alexander\u8217\'20\'19s evasive words on foreign labour on the Today programme. He had to be asked three times before he admitted that he employed a Portuguese cleaner. No crime there, you might say. But Mr Alexander is a member of a government that has set a cap on net migration. One of his ministerial colleagues, James Brokenshire, claimed that the middle-class appetite for domestic labour was to blame for the coalition missing its targets on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Once that was said, every member of the Government was fair game.\par \par \uc2 Collective responsibility is what\u8217\'20\'19s at stake here. The way government works is that you get the ministerial office, the car and the red box. And you get the blame as well. What the Liberal Democrats are trying to do is to decouple themselves \u8212\'20\'14 not from the Tories, which is understandable, but from their real record in office.\par \par \uc2 The strange thing is that, in press terms, they seem to be getting away with it. It\u8217\'20\'19s all looked on remarkably leniently by commentators who are fascinated by the strategies behind it.\par \par \uc2 Voters, however, won\u8217\'20\'19t be so easy to fool. This is hypocrisy plain and simple. A big boy did do it \u8212\'20\'14 but he had a getaway driver. Without Liberal Democrat votes there would have been no tuition fees and no bedroom tax. This is Murder on the Orient Express: all ministers, Tory and Liberal Democrat, had a hand on the deadly weapon. Forgive the electorate if they spot the blood-stained palms.\par \par \uc2 John McTernan is a former political adviser to Tony Blair and \uc2 Gordon Brown\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140310ea3a000u7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Opinion\par \b \uc2 Beyond the Fringe; Ukip has become an important party in a fragmented British political scene. The more the light is trained on the party, the odder it is starting to appear\b0\par\par\uc2 712 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par 00:01\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Fringe parties rarely matter in British politics. Small parties find it hard to break through an electoral system that gives them no help. For many years the United Kingdom Independence Party (Ukip) has been in that category but it is no longer. The time has arrived to take Ukip seriously and it is already clear that Ukip will not come out of the encounter well.\par \par \uc2 There are two reasons that Ukip has begun to count. The first is substantive, in that its appeal, largely in urban working-class areas, has little to do with its signature tune of hostility to the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . The appeal of Ukip is essentially about those people who feel they have little to gain from \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . The influx of labour into Britain has clear economic benefits at the national level but not everybody gains and Ukip, albeit in a rather strident voice, has articulated their concerns. As a result the party\u8217\'20\'19s leader, Nigel Farage, expects to come top of the poll in the European elections on May 22.\par \par \uc2 The second reason that Ukip now matters is arithmetical. Back in 1950 the Conservatives and Labour between them could expect to win more than 90 per cent of the popular vote. In 2010 the two main parties shared just 66 per cent of the vote. Despite the fall in support for the Liberal Democrats, both Labour and the Conservatives are struggling to command the support required to get over the line beyond which majority government lies. Before they went into coalition, the Liberal Democrats were a home for people who wanted to protest. Now those people go to Ukip.\par \par \uc2 This is the context in which the scrutiny of Ukip is now more intense than ever before. Already, the party has threatened to fall apart. Not many of its candidates, or indeed MEPs such as Godfrey Bloom, survive long in the sunlight. Even without quite endorsing the Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s unflattering account of Ukip as \u8220\'20\'1Cfruitcakes", it is the fate of smaller parties to attract the eccentric and the egotistical who would be lost in a larger party. Perhaps the most telling detail about Mr Farage is that he tried six times to be a Conservative MP. Of 21 Ukip MEPS elected since 1999, two have ended up in prison and 7 have either defected or resigned. Even Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s wife has referred to the party as \u8220\'20\'1Ca freak show". A former RAF pilot who was hired ostensibly to make the party more professional resigned in frustration.\par \par \uc2 If a lack of seriousness were the only concern about Ukip, that would soon be sniffed out by the voters. On Saturday, however, we exposed accusations of a lack of propriety. MEPs from Ukip were already notorious for their poor attendance record in a parliament they are committed to abolish but which provides the party with funding. It might be cynical to fill the party coffers in this way but there is nothing overtly improper about it.\par \par \uc2 However, a whistleblower from within the party ranks told The Times that Ukip staff who worked exclusively in the UK were sending invoices to Europe of Freedom and Democracy, a political grouping in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 . Such an arrangement would be a clear breach of parliamentary rules and would mean that taxpayers\u8217\'20\'19 money was going straight to the Ukip political operation. The Vice-President of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , Edward McMillan-Scott, has said that he will refer the matter today to its governing body. Today, we report that Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s MEPs have been encouraged to divert public funds to their party in another way, by paying a \u8220\'20\'1Ctithe" from their generous salary and expenses package.\par \par \uc2 It may well be that Ukip has done nothing wrong. This had better be the case, however, and not just for legal reasons. The appeal of Ukip is that of the outsider, the party that dares to tell it as it is, unlike the professional politicians. The cost to Ukip of greater scrutiny looks likely to be that this pretence of superiority starts to fall to pieces.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140310ea3a000ue\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Identity fraud rife among passengers - but usually to save money\b0\par\par\uc2 By Simon Calder TRAVEL CORRESPONDENT   \par \uc2 338 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par \uc2 i\par \uc2 IIND\par \uc2 1ST\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd.  All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 News | AIR TRAVEL\par \par \uc2 Identity misrepresentation is rife among air travellers - yet is often carried out just to save cash by otherwise law-abiding citizens.\par \par \uc2 Suppose Traveller A has booked a Gatwick-Glasgow flight weeks ahead for \u163\'00\'A340, but can no longer fly. Traveller B needs to make the same trip at short notice and faces a far higher fare. They may make a deal, at the expense of the airline.\par \par \uc2 In the last century, B would simply masquerade as A. Today, it's only slightly more complicated to defraud the airline.\par \par \uc2 For many flights within the UK, airline staff do not insist on ID. Even when they do, flimsy proof such as a railcard may suffice - so long as the name corresponds to the booking and the photo looks like you. So the passenger in the next seat may not be the person named on the ticket.\par \par \uc2 Rules for international travel are tighter, making identity theft more the preserve of organised crime.\par \par \uc2 Stolen passports are at the heart of ID fraud, with voracious demand from drug-traffickers and peoplesmugglers. Criminal craftsmen are adept at replacing photographs beneath the laminate on the personal details page - which is why increased security measures now include a second, embedded, image.\par \par \uc2 As the \uc2 Malaysian Airlines\uc2  tragedy has shown, intelligence on fake identities is not routinely shared internationally. When I renewed a passport some years ago, the document was "lost" in the post. It later turned up in the possession of an American villain. Ever since, when I arrive at US \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  I am hauled off for hours of further investigation.\par \par \uc2 The pair who departed Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on Saturday morning using stolen passports took advantage of the lack of international cooperation on ID fraud. But that doesn't mean they were to blame for downing the plane. They may simply have been illegal economic migrants, flying to Amsterdam via China simply to get a cheap fare.\par \par \uc2 Document IIND000020140310ea3a00016\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Bad speech, wrong appointment\b0\par\par\uc2 119 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par \uc2 i\par \uc2 IIND\par \uc2 1ST\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd.

\par\par \uc2 SME\par \b \uc2 Small Talk: Britain can learn a lot from Canada in the global race to woo the entrepreneurs vital to creating jobs\b0\par\par\uc2 David Prosser   \par \uc2 1,135 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par 01:03\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 If you took a drive last year out of San Francisco down Highway 101 towards Silicon Valley, you would have sped past a giant billboard emblazoned with a huge red maple leaf. Its sales pitch, \u8220\'20\'1CH-1B Problems? Pivot to Canada", was an appeal to international entrepreneurs who have moved to Silicon Valley but run into problems with the US\u8217\'20\'19s H-1B visa programme for high-skilled workers.\par \par \uc2 The billboard was paid for by the \uc2 Canadian government\uc2 , which hopes those frustrated entrepreneurs will relocate north of the border. To encourage them \u8211\'20\'13 and other high-skilled foreign citizens \u8211\'20\'13 to do so, it has been offering permanent residence to entrepreneurs who speak English or French, have completed at least one year of college, and can show they can raise funding for their business ventures.\par \par \uc2 Canada\u8217\'20\'19s Start-Up Visa is not a million miles away from the UK\u8217\'20\'19s Tier 1 Entrepreneur Visa programme, which sets similar requirements. But in Britain, we offer only a temporary permit to live and work in the UK, at least initially.\par \par \uc2 A report by the independent Centre for Entrepreneurs illustrates why it is foolhardy to put obstacles in the way of these people. One in seven UK companies was set up by a migrant, it reveals, and migrant-founded companies create 14 per cent of all jobs at small and medium-sized companies. In the UK\u8217\'20\'19s migrant community, 17.2 per cent of people have launched their own businesses, compared to only 10.4 per cent of people born in the UK. Migrant entrepreneurs also tend to be younger.\par \par \uc2 The implication is clear. If Britain wants to foster an entrepreneurial economy, which is crucial for job creation, we should be doing everything we can to attract potential founders of new businesses to this country. \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  are coming here to make our jobs, not take them.\par \par \uc2 The Government is doing more than you might think in this regard. As well as the Entrepreneur Visa, different arms of government are involved in specific projects such as the Sirius Programme, run by \uc2 UK Trade & Investment\uc2 , which offers international graduates financial and practical support with getting a business off the ground in Britain. Successful applicants have begun working with business accelerator programmes around the country and qualify for up to \u163\'00\'A312,000 of financial assistance, plus a mentoring programme and visa endorsement. More than 1,500 graduate entrepreneurs from 93 countries enrolled in Sirius in its first year.\par \par \uc2 It may be some time before the fruits of this labour are quantifiable, but the work done by the Centre for Entrepreneurs suggests we need more of these programmes \u8211\'20\'13 and much less of the toxic rhetoric that surrounds the debate over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Why move to Britain to start your business when you\u8217\'20\'19ll have to put up with this sort of nonsense when you could just as easily move to, say, Canada and be welcomed with open arms?\par \par \uc2 Matchmaker for hi-tech research projects\par \par \uc2 Tekcapital\uc2  is moving quickly. Formed just a year ago, the Oxford-based company will today announce its intention to list on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim) with a \u163\'00\'A33m fundraising that will value the company at \u163\'00\'A36m.\par \par \uc2 Tekcapital\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s business model is unusual. Like several established businesses, it aims to put to use the remarkable technologies coming out of universities and research institutions around the world. But rather than developing specific projects, it has built a continually updated database that keeps track of the intellectual property being worked on at more than 3,300 of these establishments in 160 countries. Companies in need of particular tools or technologies can then pay it to access the database to find the projects they need.\par \par \uc2 Despite its youth, \uc2 Tekcapital\uc2  is making rapid progress and hopes the fundraising will enable it to capitalise on its first-mover advantage. It has already signed up seven clients on retainers, including one Fortune 500 company, and is in negotiations with a further 18.\par \par \uc2 Icap\u8217\'20\'19s exchange can prove its worth\par \par \uc2 In the two years since the interdealer broker Icap bought Plus Markets\u8217\'20\'19 Plus Stock Exchange and renamed it the Icap Securities and Derivatives Exchange, City analysts have sometimes questioned the firm\u8217\'20\'19s commitment to its stated aim of working with small and medium-sized businesses keen to raise money. The ISDX branding made it sound more like a derivatives market, they pointed out.\par \par \uc2 At the end of last year, however, ISDX revamped the admissions criteria on its growth market segment, which aims to attract companies not yet ready to meet the higher regulatory standards of its main board. And now that market has picked up its first new company since the revamp \u8211\'20\'13 \uc2 Capital for Colleagues\uc2 , which wants to raise \u163\'00\'A32.19m through a listing.\par \par \uc2 Capital for Colleagues\uc2  was set up to provide funding and other types of support to employee-owned businesses, a sector that is attracting support from policymakers. The business will therefore be closely watched as it works with these firms \u8211\'20\'13 meanwhile, its listing will also serve as an interesting first test of ISDX\u8217\'20\'19s potential.\par \par \uc2 Small Business Man of the Week: Sebastian Pole, Co-founder, Pukka\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m a herbalist by background and when we started Pukka, I had no idea how to set up or run a company. I thought there was definitely a business in organic herbs and teas, but it wasn\u8217\'20\'19t until I saw an advert in a local magazine from someone offering to work with people to develop their businesses that we got going. I was the only person to respond to the advert, which is how I met my business partner, Tim Westwell, 11 years ago.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPukka now sells 34 different teas and 75 food supplements and we\u8217\'20\'19re launching new products all the time, including a new range of green teas this month. We\u8217\'20\'19re also in our second year of a partnership with WWF UK, which we\u8217\'20\'19re hoping will raise at least \u163\'00\'A350,000 through a donation of 20p from each tea sale we make.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ve come a long way from the day when Tim and I literally took \u163\'00\'A32,000 each out of a cashpoint on our credit cards in order to get the business up and running. That first year, we had sales of about \u163\'00\'A327,000, compared with \u163\'00\'A315m last year.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe started out selling to local independent health food stores and then branched out into dealing through multiples. These days you\u8217\'20\'19ll still find our products in those shops, but you\u8217\'20\'19ll also find us in all the big supermarket chains too, and we\u8217\'20\'19re the number two brand in the fruit and herbal tea sector."\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140310ea3a001e4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A phoney love letter from flip-flop Clegg\par \par \uc2 ANYONE wondering why the Lib Dems trail far behind Ukip should look no further than Nick Clegg's toe-curling speech to his party's spring conference.\par \par \uc2 Leave aside the folksy, phoney list of his 'loves' about Britain - from queuing to gay marriage, Prince George, the shipping forecast and flip-flops (he means the footwear, apparently, not his speciality as a serial pledge-breaker).\par \par \uc2 When it comes to policies, isn't it almost as if he is determined to prove he despises most voters?\par \par \uc2 Take \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . While polls highlight huge public concerns over the pressure on housing, schools, jobs, the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and social cohesion, Lib Dems insist we should throw open our borders even wider to admit migrants' grandparents.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Mr Clegg sees it as a matter for unalloyed rejoicing that 'our cities are home to every race, religion, colour and language in existence'.\par \par \uc2 Or foreign aid. Despite overwhelming public demand that it should be diverted to relieve hardship at home, he wants a law saying 7p in every \u163\'00\'A310 this country earns must be given away overseas.\par \par \uc2 Or consider internet porn, on which his party votes by a vast majority against automatic filters to protect children.\par \par \uc2 It's the same with the EU and human rights law. While voters want less integration, Mr Clegg wants more, accusing opponents of 'backward-looking bile'.\par \par \uc2 Does he still have his eye on a plum job in Brussels, where his heart truly lies?\par \par \uc2 After multiple U-turns yesterday, Mr Clegg's office denied he would stand down if he loses power next year.\par \par \uc2 But then this opportunist swore he would scrap tuition fees, before trebling them. With his love of flip-flops, why should we believe another word he says?\par \par \uc2 Climate of immorality\par \par \uc2 LORD Justice Fulford says he has no memory of his role in founding a campaign, in 1979, to back arrested members of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange.\par \par \uc2 Nor does he recall the details of his work for the Conspiracy Against Public Morals group - though documents show this included organising demonstrations to support PIE members and publicly championing their right to seek contact with other paedophiles.\par \par \uc2 True, this was a long time ago (though it was as shocking in the 1970s as it is today). And like Labour grandees \uc2 Patricia Hewitt\uc2 , Jack Dromey and, grudgingly, \uc2 Harriet Harman\uc2 , the judge now expresses 'regret' that his group had links with PIE.\par \par \uc2 But with PIE members under renewed investigation for 'industrial-scale' child abuse, isn't it disturbing that those who helped create a moral climate in which the likes of Jimmy Savile could flourish are now at the heart of the Establishment?\par \par \uc2 Bins and bluster\par \par \uc2 REPEATEDLY since coming to power, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has huffed and puffed his 'passionate' pledge to uphold our 'fundamental right' to have our bins emptied once a week.\par \par \uc2 Yet on his watch, the number of households condemned to fortnightly collections has increased by five million.\par \par \uc2 'It's never been just about the collection of bins,' Mr Pickles blustered last year. 'It's about how disconnected the political classes have become from the people.'\par \par \uc2 You said it, minister. No wonder so many have come to believe voting is pointless.\par \par \uc2 Prescription for harm\par \par \uc2 THE Mail accepts there are few more emotive subjects than assisted suicide.\par \par \uc2 But as ministers clear the way for allowing doctors to kill terminally ill patients, this paper fears we are sleep-walking into a law that will cause infinitely more anguish than it will relieve.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140309ea3a0000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 'PATRIOT' CLEGG'S GUSHING LOVE LETTER TO BRITAIN; ... PRAISING FLIP-FLOPS AND TEA, SHIPPING FORECASTS AND PRINCE GEORGE (BUT HIS HEART BELONGS TO BRUSSELS!)\b0\par\par\uc2 BY GERRI PEEV    \par \uc2 620 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 NICK Clegg spelt out the things he loved about Britain yesterday in a Love Actually-style overture to voters.\par \par \uc2 Praising everything from flip-flops in cold weather to the nightly shipping news, the Deputy Prime Minister tried to paint the Liberal Democrats as the guardians of Britain.\par \par \uc2 He said his party's members were true patriots for espousing values such as liberalism, openness and tolerance.\par \par \uc2 And, in an electoral gamble, he sought to present the Lib Dems as the only unashamedly pro-Europe and pro-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  party.\par \par \uc2 His speech to the party conference in York also took a swipe at UKIP, warning of an 'ungenerous, backwards looking politics'. Although he did not name UKIP leader Nigel Farage, Mr Clegg said: 'The politics of blame have found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub.'\par \par \uc2 He also ran through a cliched list of things he loved about Britain: 'I love that the shipping forecast is listened to by insomniacs of all ages, right across the country, miles from the sea.\par \par \uc2 'I love that we do respond to every problem no matter how big or small, with the same thing: a cup of tea.'\par \par \uc2 Playing a prime minister in Love Actually, Hugh Grant made a similarly patriotic appeal, describing Britain as the country of 'Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter and David Beckham's right foot.' Mr Clegg said his Spanish wife Miriam had pointed out the unique 'feeling of freedom you get in Britain'. But he said this was under threat: 'The forces of chauvinism, protectionism and xenophobia have been emboldened. The fight is now on for the future of our continent.'\par \par \uc2 In a dig at the monarchy, he said: 'I love that a country capable of extraordinary pomp and ceremony can still retain a spiky irreverance toward its establishment. A country where we line the streets waiving our Union Jacks wildly to welcome the arrival of Prince George and the next moment we're chuckling at Private Eye's front page: "Woman Has Baby".'\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg insisted not all voters liked the anti-EU or anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  message. 'There are plenty of people out there who don't want anger,' he said. 'They don't want bile. They want jobs. They want our country to have influence.'\par \par \uc2 Lib Dem activists voted for a policy to water down income thresholds for spouses of migrants - making it easier for those on low pay to bring their wives or husbands here. They backed plans for new grandparent 'super visas', which would allow elderly \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to come to Britain for up to two years. Plans to allow foreign students to stay on for three years after studying and compete with British graduates for jobs were also backed.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems have openly said they want to woo EU migrant voters in May's elections.

There is a danger of reading far too much into one minor result.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless the Ramsbottom upset could be an indicator that the conventional wisdom about the Tories\u8217\'20\'19 inevitable doom may be wrong.\par \par \uc2 The crucial point about the next general election is that it will not be a referendum on the coalition but rather a choice between Labour and the Conservatives as to who governs. This is where Labour is bound to run into trouble because of its dire record in office.\par \par \uc2 Behind all his upbeat rhetoric Miliband will be asking the electorate to hand back power to a party that ruined the public finances, wrecked the economy and deliberately allowed \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to spiral out of control.\par \par \uc2 In contrast the Tories will have a powerful narrative to tell.\par \par \uc2 They can legitimately declare that after years of Labour\u8217\'20\'19s epic mismanagement they turned round the economy, have driven down unemployment and kept inflation low.\par \par \uc2 Thanks to the tough decisions they took in their austerity programme, every one of which Labour hysterically opposed, Britain now enjoys the fastest growth in Europe.\par \par \uc2 That narrative of economic success is likely to be enhanced over the coming year, not only by George Osborne\u8217\'20\'19s forthcoming budget, which will probably contain significant tax cuts, but also by accelerating prosperity.\par \par \uc2 The run-up to the election will also show that much of the fashionable talk about the \u8220\'20\'1Cshambles" in Government is grossly overblown, little more than a product of social media froth.\par \par \uc2 In fact Cameron is a far more assured, successful Prime Minister than most of his predecessors over the last 50 years.\par \par \uc2 Without indulging in the kind of noisy spin that characterised the Labour years his administration has made solid progress in a host of areas such as reforming the welfare system, reducing crime, cutting state bureaucracy and pushing up school standards.\par \par \uc2 There have of course been damaging failures, most notably on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , while Cameron has clung far too rigidly to the expensive metropolitan orthodoxies on overseas aid and the green agenda.\par \par \uc2 It is this series of failures that has fuelled the surge in support for Ukip, which has also benefited from deepening public exasperation at the political establishment\u8217\'20\'19s reluctance to break free from the imperious, anti-democratic influence of Brussels.\par \par \uc2 But here we come to a fundamental paradox. The only way Britain can regain her independence is by voting to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and the only major party that is offering a referendum on EU membership is Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s.\par \par \uc2 Such a referendum might never happen if Ukip badly weakens the Tories and allows Labour into power.\par \par \uc2 Ironically, by splitting the Euro-sceptic vote, Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party could end up as unwitting allies of the pro-European, anti-referendum cause \u8211\'20\'13 just as Labour\u8217\'20\'19s Bennite Left inadvertently helped to back Thatcherism in the 1980s by so bitterly dividing the anti-Tory movement.\par \par \uc2 The message that a vote for Ukip is a vote for Miliband could be hammered home effectively by the Conservatives in 2015, prompting the return of many disillusioned voters. Certainly there is no reason for the Tories to despair at the moment.\par \par \uc2 One of the great myths of British politics is that sitting governments are certain to sink into fatal unpopularity.\par \par \uc2 In fact Ted Heath in 1974 is the only incumbent prime minister since the war to have lost power after his first electoral victory, while plenty of administrations have increased their share of the vote or number of seats, such as Harold Wilson in 1966 or Margaret Thatcher in 1983.\par \par \uc2 Although he is under siege now Cameron might surprise his critics by the time polling closes in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020140310ea3a0012x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw160\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2400\pichgoal600

AI was born and brought up in Hong Kong, a district called North Point right beside the sea.\par \par \uc2 I went to London when I was about 23. In Hong Kong I had been working for the managing director of a very large advertising company. There were lots of people in and out from London which was the place to be.\par \par \uc2 It was difficult to go, as a tourist you only got a short visa so I applied for a course and got a sixmonth visa. The course lasted for three months then I planned to travel around Europe.\par \par \uc2 Q What changed those plans? A Well, back in Hong Kong I had met a Belfast Telegraph journalist called David Watson. I first met him in a very romantic setting. He was my cousin's lodger along with a Canadian engineer. When my cousin got married they were invited to the banquet which would last all night. A banquet would have something like 12 different courses over the night, it takes about three hours to finish the meal. Because I spoke English I was planted between those two guys to be their host and try to explain to them what they were eating. They were all Chinese delicacies, things that even I would find exotic.\par \par \uc2 Q How did your relationship with David develop? A David was recently arrived so I was asking him where he had been and realised he hadn't seen too much. So it was actually I who phoned him a week or two later and said come on and I'll show you around.\par \par \uc2 And in fact he was the one who introduced me to alcohol. Because the majority of people in Hong Kong back then, particularly young women, didn't drink. I don't know about now but it was a fairly conservative society. It was regarded as a western bad habit. First time we met in a hotel bar, I said I have never drunk alcohol so get me something very simple and not strong. So that was my first drink and I was 22. I didn't tell my mum after \u8212\'20\'14 meeting a foreigner in a hotel bar and drinking, oh boy!\par \par \uc2 Q Then you moved to London? A Yes, I was in London and David had come back from Hong Kong, he sought me out and we started going out. Then my visa ran out and I was going to go back to Hong Kong but he proposed and said come to Belfast with me.\par \par \uc2 Q How did you find Belfast? AI arrived in Belfast in 1974, four months after the general workers strike. My friends in London thought I was bonkers because we had all seen headlines about the strikes, no fuel, no electricity.\par \par \uc2 I promised David I would stay in Belfast for six months and see what life was like.\par \par \uc2 Q What were your first impressions of Northern Ireland? A It was quite a shock. Even though you saw pictures of armoured vehicles beamed across the television programmes in England, to see it was a different matter. Being searched going in and out of the city centres, searched going into shops, it was a shock. But more so the tension. After 5.30pm, everybody would get out of the city centre. There was this atmosphere of tension, that really was difficult.\par \par \uc2 I was so used to eating out and going to the cinema in Hong Kong and London, suddenly I realised there were no restaurants open in Belfast, I asked people but where do you go for dinner? They said we don't go out for dinner, all the restaurants have been bombed out or closed.\par \par \uc2 Q But you decided to stay? A What struck me was the friendliness of people, people welcomed me with open arms and were very warm. David was a very keen mountaineer so he introduced me to mountains and I just loved the countryside. Coming from two big cities, all that open space was amazing. Walking up Slieve Donard nearly killed me, I barely had to walk up half a hill in Hong Kong, everywhere you went was public transport or taxis. I just fell in love with the people and the countryside and realised you would go to friends' houses for dinners instead of eating out. So we stayed.\par \par \uc2 Q Did you ever reconsider? A After a few years I did think about going back to Hong Kong, my parents were concerned, very worried about me staying here after hearing about all the troubles we had. I went home on one occasion and they said you are crazy, get your husband and come back here, you have a good life in Hong Kong. But David didn't want to go back, he found Hong Kong very claustrophobic, crowded and noisy.\par \par \uc2 Q Tell me about your career before politics.\par \par \uc2 AI left school at 17, the fourth child with three older brothers still in higher education. After my O-Levels I went to evening classes to do a secretarial course. I worked first for a bank in Hong Kong before the advertising agency. Then in London where there was a lot of demand for temporary secretaries.\par \par \uc2 In Belfast I started off at the newspaper Farm Week as a secretary to the editor, then moved to the BBC. I worked for the World Service as a radio production secretary but then when they realised I was a fluent Cantonese speaker they recruited me for the Chinese service covering current events here. It was quite interesting for me to speak to a world audience about Northern Ireland. I loved it.\par \par \uc2 Q The Chinese are one of the longest settled ethnic minorities here, why do you think that is? A Chinese people are very pragmatic.\par \par \uc2 They saw opportunities in Northern Ireland for setting up catering businesses in the 1960s and 70s. Other cities in the UK would have been very competitive with other fast food outlets. Buying a business was a lot cheaper here than in London or Manchester so they came out to seek the niche market. They knew that they would not be targeted as it was a conflict between the two major communities so they continued to come and became the largest ethnic minority community.\par \par \uc2 They worked very hard throughout the Troubles. You couldn't get food anywhere after the pubs closed and the only place was a Chinese carry-out, they worked very long hours, six to seven nights a weeks.\par \par \uc2 Q How did your career develop? AI left the BBC to have my two boys. When they were young I started interpreting for the police.\par \par \uc2 They were so short of interpreters.\par \par \uc2 It started very suddenly with a phone call from a police station late at night asking for me to come down and translate. I was quite concerned that there had been no training or induction. It was then called the Aliens department \u8212\'20\'14 what a word. They said you don't need training, we know you speak good English and obviously you can speak Cantonese. So I went along and became their sessional interpreter going to police stations to help take down statements and going to courts.\par \par \uc2 Q What sort of cases did you deal with? A Most of the cases were against the Chinese community. The Chinese community is probably one of the most law-abiding communities you could find. Mostly it was racist incidents or car accidents.\par \par \uc2 I had one difficult one, a rape incident which absolutely shocked me. That's why there needs to be training and I think there is now for translators. You are dealing with people who are traumatised and empathetic.\par \par \uc2 Q You were highly involved with the Chinese Welfare Association? A The Chinese Welfare Association advertised for a teacher to teach English, I thought that would be a nice part-time job. This was in 1986. I taught English to Chinese residents and then when they heard I was a police interpreter, they asked me to move to that. I believe I was the first ever community interpreter in Northern Ireland. I did that for four years. In the meantime I was doing a part-time degree at Queen's at night. Then I did a fulltime diploma course in social work at the \uc2 University of Ulster\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Q What did those courses lead to? AI had been thinking I could work specifically for the Chinese community as their first social worker. But that's not how it worked out. I ended up working for the North Down and Ards Social Services Trust as it was then. I would get cases referred to me but I was working mostly with the wider community.\par \par \uc2 Q So the police work sparked a passion for helping people? A Yes, I always wanted to try and make a difference in people's lives. Many of them are where they are because of circumstances, background, their upbringing and deprivation.\par \par \uc2 Q When did you become Director of the Chinese Welfare Association? A That was in 1997, the organisation was first set up in 1986 under an ACE scheme for longterm unemployed people so my position was the first time a director was appointed to such a scheme. They gave funding for three years and my role was to professionalise it. In the 10 years I was there I hope I achieved that. We got a sheltered housing scheme for elderly Chinese people, which was the first ever on the island of Ireland for any ethnic minority community, I also lobbied successfully for a Chinese centre which again was the first ever purpose-built community centre for an ethnic minority in Ireland and probably in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Q What was your high point during this work? AI was involved in the campaign to have the Race Relations Act extended to Northern Ireland. It had been law in England since 1976 but we didn't get it until 1997. We were 21 years behind the rest of the UK.\par \par \uc2 Q What differences did this make? A It made huge changes, before that ethnic minorities were not protected at all in terms of employment, housing, services or facilities. For example, if I walked into a company for a job interview, they could have said we don't want you because you are Chinese. We had very strong fair employment legislation so you couldn't discriminate against someone in terms of religion, political opinion or gender, but you were allowed to discriminate against someone depending on their race or nationality right up to 1997.\par \par \uc2 Q How did you first get involved with the Alliance Party? AI have always been interested in politics. My husband David, who has since died, was the political correspondent for the Belfast Telegraph for 15 years so I would have met a lot of senior politicians. It was funny, at the beginning I think some felt slighted when I didn't know who they were.\par \par \uc2 In my own right during the years I worked for the BBC and in the Chinese community I would have lobbied lots of politicians.\par \par \uc2 I have always voted for Alliance, my mother-in-law was a very active member in east Belfast. I would have gone with her to some of the fundraisers and social events but with David being a journalist we couldn't join any political parties.\par \par \uc2 Naomi Long got me involved with Alliance, I knew her well through her role as chair of the Good Relations panel. She asked me in December 2006 if I would stand for Alliance in South Belfast. I consulted with a few people, looked at voting records and thought, ah well, I might stand a chance. It'll be interesting to test out the attitude of the people of south Belfast if they would accept a person so clearly not affiliated to one side or another.\par \par \uc2 Q How did you find the experience? AI was pleasantly surprised when I was elected. The Chinese community for a long time have stayed neutral and worked with both sides of the community and Alliance fits in with that for me. I would not have felt comfortable in any other party, I am not a Christian, my parents would be Taoist which is in a way fairly similar to the Liberal Party's thinking. I am not Catholic or Protestant, I am not a unionist or nationalist. In many ways it puts me in a unique position to look at issues genuinely without tinted glasses, which other people might not be in a position to do.\par \par \uc2 Q Has Hong Kong noticed your success here? A Oh yes, they were berserk when I was elected, there was a big write-up in the Oriental Daily. Someone wrote to me recently and said he was in Hong Kong when a GP said "oh you are from Northern Ireland?" And pulled out a newspaper article about me and said "she is from here!" People are very very proud. When the First and Deputy First Minister went to visit Hong Kong, my name was mentioned quite a lot apparently and people were very proud of the fact that they have someone elected here. I am the first ever in western Europe I think.\par \par \uc2 They are also very proud in China, someone told me that they were at a museum in China and there was a write-up and a picture of me in a museum.\par \par \uc2 Q You spoke about working with Chinese people who were targeted in racist attacks in the 1970s, has that been fairly consistent in all the time you have been here? A Yes, there has always been low-level racist harassment on the Chinese community since I first arrived. There was research to say two-thirds have experienced verbal racist abuse and half said they have had properties damaged.\par \par \uc2 Although the focus of racism has now moved to newer comers like the Polish, which is totally wrong again. Countries benefit from contributions from \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , they bring ideas and skills to the country.\par \par \uc2 It's an issue of supply and demand, they come here because they know there are jobs vacant here that local firms cannot fill. If there are no jobs they wouldn't come. They come to do a lot of the jobs that local people don't want to do like in factories and in good packaging firms. A lot also work in the \uc2 National Health Service\uc2  as doctors and nurses. Filipino nurses and Egyptian doctors. The health service wouldn't be able to function without them.\par \par \uc2 Q Have you had a lot of abuse directed at you since you became elected? A Yes, when I first stood there was a racist website which posted quite a lot of racist postings, even pornographic pictures of Asian-looking women, branding me as a madame running a brothel. It was horrific. I get people ringing up and saying how dare you stand. Occasionally I get threats. But that is part and parcel of being a public representative.\par \par \uc2 During the flag protests I had to get security at my home stepped up.\par \par \uc2 Q You don't regret getting involved with politics? A Not at all, I love the work in the committees. I am chair of the environment committee which holds the minister and department to account, you know you are doing real work.\par \par \uc2 I would have a very close working relationship with the Environment sector.\par \par \uc2 I am very passionate about the protection of the environment and striking a balance between economic development and environment protection.\par \par \uc2 'They knew they would not be targeted... it was a conflict between two communities'\par \par \uc2 'There was a racist website which branded me as a madam running a brothel''\par \par \uc2 Document WBEL000020140310ea3a00015\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 The New York Times is totally wrong in its attack on London\b0\par\par\uc2 ALLISTER HEATH   \par \uc2 624 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par \uc2 City AM\par \uc2 CITYMO\par \uc2 1; National\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014. CITY AM.   \par \par \uc2 AN op-ed in the New York Times slamming the UK's response to the Ukrainian crisis is making waves. Its author, Ben Judah, makes some decent if unoriginal points about how London depends on Russian cash, but his piece is so full of holes a fisking is in order. Here goes.\par \par \uc2 1 "On the [Shard's] top floors, ultra high net worth individuals entertain escorts in luxury apartments. By day, on floors below, investment bankers trade incomprehensible derivatives."\par \par \uc2 Wrong. The flats haven't been sold yet. There are no rich owners and no prostitutes. There are no derivatives traders - the only financial firm that has moved in is Duff and Phelps, which provides various corporate advisory, valuation and restructuring services.\par \par \uc2 2 "The old imperial elite has become crude and mercenary...Britain's ruling class has decayed to the point where its first priority is protecting its cut of Russian money...Any moralising remnant of the British Empire is gone." Nonsense. The UK establishment has always been mercenary and generally put growth first, and it continues to moralise (about the environment and much else). The old elite liked to invade countries; the modern one cannot, having run out of cash. But forget the elites: the UK public doesn't want to risk a recession by waging a trade war. The author says that the UK is betraying the US, but America has practised a similar kind of diplomacy for years with China, Saudi Arabia etc.\par \par \uc2 3 "The townhouses in the capital's poshest districts are empty."\par \par \uc2 A laughable exaggeration. Yes, some overseas buyers keep their properties empty. But Kensington and Chelsea's resident population fell just 2.2 per cent in the decade to 2011; it remains the second most densely populated local authority in England and Wales. Other boroughs with prime property have seen their population soar.\par \par \uc2 4 "The grotty Southwark riverside" Out of date. The London Bridge area is being transformed; major multinationals are based in More London and the regeneration zone keeps expanding.\par \par \uc2 5 "A city where oligarchs are celebrated and migrants are exploited but that pretends to be a multicultural utopia."\par \par \uc2 Garbage. On most metrics London is astonishingly well integrated - the one racist/fascist party has all but vanished, school kids whose native language isn't English now get almost identical results as native speakers, more and more children are of mixed parentage, all jobs are open to migrants, including the governorship of the Bank of England. London is probably better at integration than any other major city. The idea that migrants are all being exploited is extreme ignorance. Just look at any office in a bank, a tech firm or any business; a vast chunk of the best-paid, best qualified people are migrants. And among the low-paid, most have been able to send money home or drastically improve their lives.\par \par \uc2 6 "Near the Shard are the \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from Lithuania and Romania, who broke their backs on construction sites, but are now destitute and whiling away their hours along the banks of the Thames."\par \par \uc2 Complete fantasy - and numbers of Eastern Europeans in work keep rising.\par \par \uc2 7 "The planning regulations have been scrapped".\par \par \uc2 How wrong can anybody be? The main claim is that Londoners have become the "oligarchs' valets." What the author doesn't mention are the equally important Russian-German gas and trade ties, how our trade policy is determined at EU level, or how China and the US operate their own interdependent relationship of convenience. The West needs to become much tougher on Putin - but ending globalisation would be utterly foolish.\par \par \uc2 allister.heath@cityam.com Follow me on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @allisterheath\par \par \uc2 Document CITYMO0020140310ea3a0001s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 NICK CLEGG sang a hymn of praise to Britain yesterday, paying tribute to tea, the shipping forecast and football, as he warned that freedom and tolerance were at risk from a tide of far\u8211\'20\'13Right extremism sweeping Europe.\par \par \uc2 The Deputy Prime Minister said the Liberal Democrats were the true party of patriots that would defend British values from a "dangerous" trend of hostility to foreigners.\par \par \uc2 He placed the UK Independence Party alongside Hungary's Jobbik and the French Front National, indicating Nigel Farage was the "acceptable face of blame" while his party offered "anger and bile".\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg wants to frame May's European elections as a straight fight between the two parties. It will be a contest of "Great Britain" versus "little England", he said, claiming "We are the guardians of a modern, open and tolerant Britain."\par \par \uc2 In a speech that echoed John Major's paean to a land of warm beer and green suburbs 20 years ago, Mr Clegg hailed the British traditions of queuing, wearing flip\u8211\'20\'13flops in cold weather and satire as well as same\u8211\'20\'13sex marriage and the rule of law.\par \par \uc2 He told the Lib Dem spring conference in York: "I love Britain. I love that a country capable of extraordinary pomp and ceremony can still retain a spiky irreverence towards its establishment.\par \par \uc2 "A country where we line the streets waving our Union Jacks wildly to welcome the arrival of Prince George, and the next moment we're chuckling at Private Eye's front page: 'Woman Has Baby'.\par \par \uc2 "I love that the shipping forecast is listened to by insomniacs of all ages, right across the country, miles from the sea. I love that we do respond to every problem no matter how big or small with the same thing: a cup of tea."\par \par \uc2 Globalisation and the rise of China have not brought the promised spread of democracy and liberal values and on the Continent anti\u8211\'20\'13semitic parties that regard foreigners as "filth" are winning support, he warned.\par \par \uc2 "This is our back yard. The forces of chauvinism, protectionism and xenophobia have been emboldened. And there is no doubt about it: the fight is now on for the future direction of our continent."\par \par \uc2 He stressed Britain was "lucky" to avoid such extremism but said an "ungenerous, backwards looking politics" is on the rise.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg did not identify Ukip or Mr Farage by name but aides said the speech was aimed squarely at them. The two men will debate whether to withdraw from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  on television next month. "Ukip think they love Brit\u8211\'20\'13ain. There's nothing patriotic about putting jobs at risk," a senior Liberal Democrat source said.\par \par \uc2 Last week Mr Farage hardened his party's anti\u8211\'20\'13\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  stance, claiming he travelled on trains in south London on which no one spoke English.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg's address also follows \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's off\u8211\'20\'13the\u8211\'20\'13cuff defence of "bighearted" Britain at the G20 summit in St Petersburg last year, after it was a dismissed by a Russian official as "just a small island".\par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrats have fought to take credit for the Coalition's tax cuts, but yesterday Iain Duncan Smith, the Welfare Secretary, disputed a claim by Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, that the Tories had to be "forced" into raising the income tax threshold.\par \par \uc2 "That's not my recollection.

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 THE number of criminals, migrants and others exploiting human rights laws has increased by almost a third despite government pledges to stop the practice.\par \par \uc2 Human rights were cited in a total of 367 court cases last year compared with 283 in the previous 12 months, with the majority involving criminal or \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  matters.\par \par \uc2 But the figures show the influence is spreading to all aspects of law after the number of tax cases which invoked human rights laws doubled.\par \par \uc2 Ministers have tried to stop foreign criminals and illegal migrants from using the right to family life to avoid deportation but the courts have regularly ignored the new rules.\par \par \uc2 The latest figures, obtained by Thomson Reuters legal business, show a 30 per cent rise in cases in 12 months.\par \par \uc2 Dominic Raab, the Tory MP and campaigner for reform, said: "The rights inflation, driven by judicial legislation from Strasbourg and the Human Rights Act, is eating away at our law enforcement and deportation capacity. We need to overhaul the law."\par \par \uc2 Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, said: "The Convention on Human Rights was drawn up in the aftermath of the Second World War, with the noble intention of protecting people's fundamental rights \u8211\'20\'13 such as the right not to be tortured or the right to a fair trial. But it seems a bit of a damming indictment of Labour's Human Rights Act that now it is being used as such a ready recourse for people wanting to bring claims for issues that would have been far from the minds of the convention's original creators."\par \par \uc2 Last year it emerged that the terrorism suspect who evaded police by wearing a burka was suing the Government for allegedly breaching his human rights.\par \par \uc2 Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed remains at large but his lawyers are continuing to sue the Government for alleged mistreatment during his arrest and detention in Somaliland in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Figures in November also suggested that thousands of foreigners arrested in Britain routinely avoid deportation.\par \par \uc2 Theresa May, the Home Secretary, has said the Conservatives to repeal the Human Rights Act if they win the next general election.\par \par \uc2 However, in January, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , with the help of Labour and the Liberal Democrats, blocked a Tory back\u8211\'20\'13bench move to toughen human rights laws.\par \par \uc2 More than 90 Conservative MPs voted for an amendment to the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Bill intended to make it harder for foreign criminals to avoid deportation, but Mr Cameron said the plan was unlawful.\par \par \uc2 The latest survey also showed that the number of tax\u8211\'20\'13related court cases involving human rights claims had increased from 12 to 25 last year.\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140310ea3a0003k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Tories accused of starting 'witch hunt' over foreign workers\b0\par\par\uc2 Matthew Holehouse; James Kirkup   \par \uc2 542 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph\par \uc2 DT\par \uc2 1; National\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Daily Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 THE Conservatives have caused a "witch hunt" where anyone who employs foreign labour is at risk of criticism, a Liberal Democrat minister has said.\par \par \uc2 David Laws accused James Brokenshire, the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, of demonising workers from overseas and those who hire them.\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire last week appeared to criticise middle\u8211\'20\'13class households and businesses for creating a demand for \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , saying that the "wealthy metropolitan elite" wanted cheap labour and services. That has raised political questions for Cabinet ministers including \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and Nick Clegg, who employ people from overseas to work in their homes.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister, who has called for curbs on the arrival of unskilled workers, employs a Nepal\u8211\'20\'13born nanny who has been granted British citizenship. A member of Mr Clegg's domestic staff holds a Belgian passport. Theresa May, the Home Secretary, has a Brazilian\u8211\'20\'13born cleaner.\par \par \uc2 Mr Laws, the schools minister and a close adviser to Mr Clegg, said Mr Brokenshire's comments had triggered a "feeding frenzy".\par \par \uc2 He told BBC Radio Five Live: "I hope that this witch hunt will end. We rely upon in our country \u8211\'20\'13 for things like the \uc2 National Health Service\uc2  and many very tough, low\u8211\'20\'13paid jobs \u8211\'20\'13 a lot of people who are legitimately in the country."\par \par \uc2 He added: "If we create a climate where anyone who looks or feels foreign is someone you shouldn't be employing, that is bad for our country."\par \par \uc2 Mr Laws noted that business groups, including the Institute of Directors, had criticised Mr Brokenshire's speech.\par \par \uc2 "They know it would be a disaster for our country if we were not to be able to attract some of the hugely skilled people we need for our economy and our health service.\par \par \uc2 "We must not get into a feeding frenzy where we put off really skilled people."\par \par \uc2 In his first major speech since taking on the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  brief last month, Mr Brokenshire attempted to align the Conservative Party with working\u8211\'20\'13class voters, whom pollsters say are most unhappy about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and most tempted to vote for the UK Independence Party.\par \par \uc2 "For too long, the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour, or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services \u8211\'20\'13 but not to the ordinary, hard\u8211\'20\'13working people of this country," he said in a speech to a London think tank.\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire's attempt to focus political attention on the "metropolitan elite" has irritated some of his Conservative colleagues, who fear the result will be that more voters regard politicians as members of that elite.\par \par \uc2 Patrick McLoughlin, the Conservative Transport Secretary and a former coalminer, said: "It's the first time I've been called part of the metropolitan elite."\par \par \uc2 The row over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has seen the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats taking ever more divergent positions on the issue.\par \par \uc2 While the Tories remain committed to cutting annual net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 now more than 250,000 \u8211\'20\'13 to fewer than 100,000, the Lib Dems are making the economic case for more relaxed migration rules.\par \par \uc2 'For things like the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and many tough, low\u8211\'20\'13paid jobs, we rely on people who are legitimately in the country.'\par \par \uc2 Document DT00000020140310ea3a0005e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

Ukip spokesman Tim Aker said: "This shows the Government has virtually no control over our borders.\par \par \uc2 "It shows how broken our migration system is \u8211\'20\'13 and the longer this is allowed to go on the more chaotic the situation will get.\par \par \uc2 "We need to be outside the EU in order to have full control over our borders so we know who is in the UK and who is deserving of benefi ts and not."\par \par \uc2 It was revealed last week net UK migration rose to 212,000 in the year to September 2013, pushing it further away from Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's target of below 100,000 by 2015.\par \par \uc2 The net fl ow \u8211\'20\'13 the numbers moving to the UK minus those leaving \u8211\'20\'13 soared from 154,000 the previous year. The increase was driven by a huge growth in the number of EU citizens fl ocking to Britain.\par \par \uc2 There are now 5.6 million claiming working\u8211\'20\'13age handouts in Britain \u8211\'20\'13 roughly 16.5 per cent of the 33.6 million working population.\par \par \uc2 Individuals need to supply a National Insurance number when making a claim or starting a job. \uc2 Department for Work and Pensions\uc2  fi gures show NI registrations to adult overseas nationals entering the UK has nearly doubled in a decade.\par \par \uc2 In 2002 there were 311,288 but that fi gure jumped to 617,237 in 2013. Those coming here from within the EU and demanding an NI number totalled 385,000 in 2012/13 \u8211\'20\'13 a 10 per cent increase on the previous year. Leading the way were people from Poland but almost 18,000 Romanians arrived too.\par \par \uc2 Britain's soft\u8211\'20\'13touch reputation for benefi ts meant, as of February last year, 31 per cent of claimants who were non\u8211\'20\'13UK nationals when fi rst registering for a NI number were from within the EU, including 15 per cent from accession countries. Of the rest, 32 per cent were from Asia and the Middle East with 24 per cent from Africa.\par \par \uc2 EU migrants account for 25 per cent of all non\u8211\'20\'13UK nationals claiming Jobseeker's Allowance.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of unrestricted \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from within the EU have said that severe strain is being placed on frontline public services as a result.\par \par \uc2 Harrow, in north\u8211\'20\'13west London, is already home to 5,000 Romanians but experts think there is an "underground" population of 1,000 living in 319 illegal "beds\u8211\'20\'13in\u8211\'20\'13sheds" accommodation across the borough.\par \par \uc2 Yet a Home Offi ce spokesman claimed its policy of controlling \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was on track.\par \par \uc2 He added: "Our reforms have cut non\u8211\'20\'13EU migration to its lowest level since 1998. There are now 82,000 fewer people arriving annually from outside the EU than when this government came to power. Overall fi gures are also well down from when we came to government in 2010 with nearly 70,000 fewer migrants coming to the UK.\par \par \uc2 "The Government is ensuring controls on accessing benefi ts and services, including the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and social housing, are among the tightest in Europe."\par \par \uc2 OPINION: PAGE 12\par \par \uc2 National Insurance registrations of migrants entering UK 2002\u8211\'20\'132013 2002 311,288 2003 362,152 2004 412,740 2005 618,692 2006 632,937 2007 797,090 2008 669,660 2009 613,237 2010 667,486 TOTAL 6,892,692 Source: \uc2 Department for Work and Pensions\uc2  2011 671,219 2012 518,954 2013 617,237\par \par \uc2 2008 Non\u8211\'20\'13UK nationals claiming benefits 288,720\par \par \uc2 2013 Non\u8211\'20\'13UK nationals claiming benefits 397,000\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140310ea3a0008j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

Desperate to foist their ideology on a reluctant public they trumpet the diligence of all new arrivals, without whose hard work our economy and public services would supposedly collapse.\par \par \uc2 The emptiness of that claim has been exposed by shocking new figures obtained by this paper. These show that in February 2013 no fewer than 397,000 \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  were living off benefits provided by the taxpayer, a phenomenal increase of 110,000 in five years.\par \par \uc2 That rise makes a mockery of the sanctimonious rhetoric in favour of unrestricted free movement and open borders. The truth, as today's statistics demonstrate, is that many foreigners who come here are freeloaders eager to exploit our absurdly generous benefits.\par \par \uc2 The ease with which migrants can claim social security is profoundly damaging to our country. First, it is completely unaffordable, especially since our welfare bill is already more than \u163\'00\'A3220billion. Second, it destroys the welfare contract: support is meant to be based on past payments of tax and national insurance. By definition newly arrived migrants have made no contribution to our society.\par \par \uc2 A simple solution would be to bar all migrants from claiming benefits until they had paid tax for at least five years but sadly, given the feebleness of our political class combined with the despotism of the EU, there is no sign of that happening. So we will have to keep on subsidising scroungers.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140310ea3a0002n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

I suspect deep down he knows that there are more people who will vote to leave the EU," Mr Bone said.\par \par \uc2 He added that it was "absurd" to think quitting the EU would wreck the economic recovery. "Britain would be billions of pounds better off out."\par \par \uc2 In Mr Clegg's address to the party conference in York, he claimed: "The politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub."\par \par \uc2 It was a clear reference to Ukip leader Nigel Farage whose populist touch has been identified as one of the reasons behind his party's rise in support - a surge that has seen the Lib Dems pushed into fourth place in the opinion polls. The pair will face off in two debates ahead of May's European elections, a vote that Mr Farage has said his party can win.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg sought to position the Lib Dems as the "only party of in" and rally his troops ahead of the campaign, telling them to "forget the lazy assumption that, in the court of public opinion, the eurosceptics will automatically win".\par \par \uc2 He pledged: "I am going to defend the tolerant and modern Britain we love, and I am going to start by showing people what's at stake in the upcoming European elections: do you want Britain in Europe or out? "That's the real question in May. One party wants out. Another is flirting with exit. The other lot don't have the courage of their convictions on this - they're saying nothing at all."\par \par \uc2 In a bizarre speech Mr Clegg, who yesterday insisted he will be Lib Dem leader until 2020, also told voters why he loves modern Britain. He named flip-flops, cups of tea, Prince George, the BBC, football, the shipping forecast, the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and queueing. A Ukip spokesman said last night: "The truth is that there are three parties of in and just one party that wants to take Britain out of the EU."\par \par \uc2 He added: "More and more people realise you cannot control \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  if you don't control your borders. Britain needs to leave the EU to control its borders."\par \par \uc2 OPINION: PAGE 12\par \par \uc2 q Is Clegg right to claim Britain is better off in EU?

It is straight out of the theatre of the absurd."\par \par \uc2 The Government claims the scheme will avoid costly legal battles once the migrants arrive in Britain.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, it emerged the Home Office paid out almost \u163\'00\'A380million in resettlement grants at a rate of \u163\'00\'A31.2million a month to 21,506 people who reached the UK. The Assisted Voluntary Return programme in the UK gives up to \u163\'00\'A32,000 of "in kind" support for those willing to return home without appealing against removal.\par \par \uc2 This latest Greek scheme was announced in Athens a fortnight ago by British ambassador John Kittmer.\par \par \uc2 The project is run by the \uc2 International Organisation for Migration\uc2 , a body that organises migrant removals for governments globally.\par \par \uc2 A Home Office spokesman said: "The purpose of this project is to save British taxpayers money by preventing illegal migration to this country."\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140310ea3a0004h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 Here's why the posh London set all want an Aussie\b0\par\par\uc2 Damian Whitworth   \par \uc2 1,246 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par \uc2 The Times\par \uc2 T\par \uc2 1; Eire\par 36,37\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 David Cameron's childcare choice is the norm. Who can afford an English nanny now, asks\par \par \uc2 The \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate has taken one of its stranger turns with calls for David Cameron to explain why he employed an Australian nanny rather than a British one. Talk to weary veterans of the childcare market, however, and they would wonder why he hadn't done it sooner. An informal survey suggests that most parents can't (or won't) afford a British nanny and, given a choice, nine out of ten would go for an Aussie. And if you can't get one of those a Kiwi will do.\par \par \uc2 "They speak the language and are generally can-do and energetic, and very practical," says one North London mother who has hired British nannies but swears by the athletic girl from the Outback who looked after her daughter while she was working long office days. "Australians come on two-year visas and they live in your house because they want to save every penny and 'do Europe' while they are here. They knuckle down and work because they don't want the hassle of looking for another job. And they aren't looking for promotion or a new career. English nannies are always looking to up their status."\par \par \uc2 We don't know why Cameron employed an Australian woman. Probably she was simply the best candidate that he and Samantha interviewed. But there are some very good reasons why British families rely on an international brigade of nannies and carers.\par \par \uc2 For a start British nannies are expensive. "People get the best person they can get with the money available. Childcare is very expensive in the UK and in London in particular," says Fiona Neill, the author of What the Nanny Saw. "A top nanny costs a lot. A really good, well-educated, fully trained British nanny can cost \u163\'00\'A360,000 a year and that is a lot of money for any family. Only UHNWIs [ultra highnet-worth individuals] will pay that." Often these are foreign families living in London who want an English-speaking nanny. "They have homes that are the modern equivalent of Downton Abbey with a Filipino housekeeper, a gardener, a driver and a handyman. An English nanny is a brand, so in that sense it is a nanny's market. They are unaffordable for English people." As well as cost there is the small matter of the job description, Neill says. "Lots of people have Filipino nannies who are also housekeepers. Some foreign nannies are more amenable to doing more mundane domestic tasks. British nannies won't do that \u8212\'20\'14 not out of a sense of entitlement, but because they don't consider it part of their job description. They will do things that are childcare related but they won't do things that a housekeeper or a cleaning lady would do."\par \par \uc2 A mother-of-three in Camden says she found herself competing against neighbours for the services of a Norland nanny. She won the battle but says: "When you are trying to get a top-notch British nanny it is the inverse of the normal relationship. When they come for the interview they are interviewing you. They are visiting five or six families and choosing their employer. This is based on salary and what other perks you are offering such as gym membership or use of a car, but also whether they think you are going to be interfering in the way they look after the children. They don't want to kowtow to the parents on matters like discipline."\par \par \uc2 Sometimes ambitious nannies select a family that will provide the right challenges, such as looking after three children or children under school age, which they can then put on their CV. Foreign nannies, however, "mostly just want a job and will do what you ask them to do; they accept a broader job description. They might not scrub the floors but they will tidy up and wait in for the \uc2 Ocado\uc2  delivery. A British nanny might do that but they will let you know that they have done it as a favour."\par \par \uc2 We British can get ourselves in a terrible, angst-ridden, class-conscious tangle when it comes to hiring people. "Employing people from abroad sits more easily with your liberal sensibilities," a South London mother says. With British employees it can feel more awkward.\par \par \uc2 "It's easier to tell someone foreign to do more," says an East London mother of two with a demanding media job. "It's our awkwardness about the feeling of employing servants. You just feel more comfortable telling a Bulgarian to empty the dishwasher. It feels more awkward with an English girl and they seem less ready to do it. The Filipinos on the other hand go the whole way and do everything."\par \par \uc2 Many British nannies see caring for children as treading water until something better comes along. Neill observes that students and graduates, who used to work as nannies a generation ago, are now being hired as tutors.\par \par \uc2 "I had one nanny who wanted to be a child psychologist; this was just a second job for her," the East London mother says. "Another wanted to be an actress. It's an insecure feeling with someone like that. You want someone who will be there for a while and build a relationship with your children."\par \par \uc2 Even career nannies can come with an unsettling attitude. "We had a fully qualified Welsh nanny who claimed to have looked after the children of a famous pop star and cost an absolute fortune," the woman from South London says. "It turned out that for her everything was too much trouble. She had been doing it for years but she had an ideological problem with people who were rich enough to employ nannies, which is not an ideal starting point if you want to be a nanny." Since then she has had 14 nannies and au pairs "of every nationality and religion". The best? "The Eastern Europeans are unbelievable: they work so hard. The Germans are a bit stern but generally very good."\par \par \uc2 Almost a match, in fact, for the Aussie nannies. "We had a wonderful British nanny for years and she travelled round the world with us," says one globe-trotting businessman now settled in North London. "But British nannies are quite expensive so meanly we went for the cheaper option. We had a succession of Australian nannies, each more muscular than the next. We both travel a lot for work at short notice and they lived in and were always there, able to paint toenails and talk about cricket."\par \par \uc2 "My Australian nanny was unfazed by wildlife," says the North London mother happily.

By definition newly arrived migrants have made no contribution to our society.\par \par \uc2 A simple solution would be to bar all migrants from claiming benefits until they had paid tax for at least five years but sadly, given the feebleness of our political class combined with the despotism of the EU, there is no sign of that happening. So we will have to keep on subsidising scroungers.\par \par \uc2 --------------------------\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg\u8217\'20\'19s no democrat\par \par \uc2 Beleaguered Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has a novel approach to politics.

\par\par \b \uc2 Vitamin D \u8211\'20\'13 could it stop 'modern\u8217\'20\'19 diseases? An award-winning writer and scientist belives a deficiency of Vitamin D in pregnant women is behind the increase in conditions such as MS, diabetes, schizophrenia and asthma\b0\par\par\uc2 By Oliver Gillie   \par \uc2 3,393 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par 06:50\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Scientists often liken the process of discovery to doing a jigsaw. At first, few pieces fit and the picture is a mystery. Then suddenly two or three pieces lock together and an image starts to take shape.\par \par \uc2 This is what is happening in the study of apparently unrelated, chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, diabetes and asthma. These conditions are increasingly common both in the UK and elsewhere; their causes have puzzled doctors and scientists for decades.\par \par \uc2 Now pieces of the jigsaw are starting to fit together \u8211\'20\'13 and they focus on vitamin D which is produced naturally in the skin when exposed to sunlight.\par \par \uc2 A deficiency in this crucial vitamin, thanks to our increasingly indoor lifestyles, is already blamed for the reappearance of rickets, the painful and deforming bone disease in children, in the UK. But gradually, evidence is emerging that links low vitamin D levels to a rise in a whole host of \u8220\'20\'1Cmodern" diseases, some of which were virtually unheard of in the pre-industrial era.\par \par \uc2 As a scientist and writer, I first realised the significance of vitamin D for prevention of ill-health some 12 years ago, at a time when it was only recognised as important for bone growth. I have researched and written extensively on the topic, including a report on the health benefits of sunlight - this at a time when official advice was to avoid the sun at all costs, especially when the sun is at its highest.\par \par \uc2 The report, published in 2004, gained support from the late \uc2 Sir Richard Doll\uc2 , the eminent epidemiologist who co-discovered the link between smoking and lung cancer. He had completed a clinical trial which found that people who took vitamin D supplements may live longer - and had he lived had wanted to do another. It has taken eight years to get that clinical trial started with Professor Julian Peto of the \uc2 London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\uc2 . Called VIDAL, the trial is looking at benefits of supplementation and for any increase in life expectancy in over 65s.\par \par \uc2 Highlighting the benefits of vitamin D has led to at least some degree of change in official attitudes. We are now advised to spend some time in the sun at midday, while vitamin D supplements are advised for breastfed (but not bottlefed) babies from the first month of life.\par \par \uc2 My belief is that we could go much further \u8211\'20\'13 that vitamin D, given freely to all women in pregnancy, could be used to curb or prevent some major diseases including multiple sclerosis, diabetes, schizophrenia, asthma and several cancers; and that it might also be used to treat established disease, at least in early stages.\par \par \uc2 One crucial piece in the jigsaw has come from the study of birthdays. Links between birthdays and future life events have long been the territory of clairvoyants and mediums; and when evidence first emerged about a decade ago that people born at the end of winter were more likely to get multiple sclerosis and those born in autumn less so, many scientists found it hardly credible.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt looked as if we were interested in star signs and futurology," said George Ebers, emeritus professor in the Department of Department of Clinical Neurology at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, \uc2 University of Oxford\uc2 , whose career has never deviated from scientific correctness. \u8220\'20\'1CBut now we know that MS is associated with end of winter births, when shortage of sunshine is demonstrable and vitamin D levels are lowest. This suggests, in line with other observations, that vitamin D protects against the disease."\par \par \uc2 THE POWER OF THE SUMMER SUN\par \par \uc2 Summer sun is at its maximum in June and July but vitamin D, generated in the skin by sunlight, takes two or three months to get into the general circulation. So we reach our maximum level of vitamin D in about September. Babies born in October or November have the best chance of a relatively high level of vitamin D during their final months in the womb. And this, the birthday evidence suggests, can protect them from MS, while the risk is higher for babies born at the end of winter.\par \par \uc2 This seasonal pattern in the risk of MS has now been found in eight different countries including Australia, winning over previously sceptical scientists. Less well known is the link between end of winter birthdays and an increased risk of several other diseases. Studies of thousands of birthdays in Europe, Canada and Australia over some 30 years have found that people born at this time are also at greater risk of type 1 diabetes, coeliac disease (gluten intolerance), schizophrenia and autism.\par \par \uc2 For a long time experts did not know what to make of this data, since these diseases had no obvious links. But now more conditions are being added to this list by the Oxford team. Writing in the peer-reviewed journal, BMC Medicine, in July 2012, Professor Ebers, working with Dr Sreeram Ramagopalan, has shown that the risk of rheumatoid arthritis, a digestive disease called ulcerative colitis and a distressing condition called systemic lupus erythematosus follows the same pattern of seasonal births. These are all autoimmune diseases, which occur when the body is attacked by its own immune system. Diabetes type 1 is also an autoimmune disease and in the case of coeliac disease the immune reaction is to wheat in the bowel. To date, at least 18 autoimmune diseases have been linked to low vitamin D levels \u8211\'20\'13 more than enough to demonstrate a pattern.\par \par \uc2 ''These immune-mediated diseases are one of the most common disease groups in modern economies today, affecting some 10% of the world population. Vitamin D deficiency is the most obvious risk factor" says Dr Ramagopalan. To test this theory Dr Ramagopalan has examined blood taken from the umbilical cords of 50 healthy babies born in November and 50 born in May when, after winter, levels of vitamin D are low. The May babies had a far higher frequency of newly generated white blood cells called T cells which are normally programmed to react against infection by an outside agent and to tolerate the body\u8217\'20\'19s own tissues.\par \par \uc2 However certain types of T cells react against the body tissues and they may cause autoimmune disease later on if they persist. These unwanted T cells are normally removed from the body in the first year of life by a clever arrangement - they are deleted in the thymus gland, a process that requires vitamin D. So a low vitamin D\par \par \uc2 level leaves the baby at risk. Dr Ramagopalan has explained his findings in detail in the open access, peer-reviewed PLOS Genetics, 2009, in which he writes: \u8220\'20\'1CThe prevalence of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis correlate positively with latitude and reduced ultraviolet radiation exposure which is the primary determinant of vitamin D levels."\par \par \uc2 The scientific jigsaw is now making more sense, but some pieces still do not seem to fit. Why should schizophrenia, a mental health condition, be linked to season of birth? In fact the birthday evidence on schizophrenia has provided a vital scientific clue to a disease which has puzzled doctors for over 100 years. Researchers now recognise that schizophrenia also has features of an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks its own tissues.\par \par \uc2 Schizophrenia and MS are both diseases of the nervous system. In MS myelin nerve sheaths deep in the nervous system are attacked by an immune reaction. If this can happen in MS, surely it is not so strange that schizophrenia may be explained similarly by an immune attack on crucial areas of the brain.\par \par \uc2 Dr John McGrath, international expert in schizophrenia based at the \uc2 University of Queensland, Australia\uc2 , says the evidence suggests that sun exposure in pregnancy and early life protects against schizophrenia and \u8220\'20\'1Craises the tantalising prospect that optimising vitamin D status during pregnancy may lead to the primary prevention of the disease".\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBeing born in the country where there is more opportunity for sun exposure is associated with a lower risk of schizophrenia - while moving subsequently to an urban area where more time is spent indoors does not seem to increase the risk," he points out.\par \par \uc2 Could lack of vitamin D in pregnancy also explain autism? The latest evidence suggests that a low vitamin D level in the mother\u8217\'20\'19s body during pregnancy may induce her immune system to make antibodies which can damage the baby\u8217\'20\'19s brain, as well as causing certain genes to malfunction. Last month, Rhonda Patrick and Bruce Ames from the \uc2 Children\u8217\'20\'19s Hospital Oakland Research Institute\uc2 , in California, published research findings that these genes normally make the chemical serotonin.\par \par \uc2 Too little of this neurotransmitter is associated with abnormal social behaviour while too much in the digestive tract causes sensitivity to foods which may explain some autistic children\u8217\'20\'19s difficult eating habits.\par \par \uc2 Patrick and Ames, both well-respected scientists in the field of autism, suggest: \u8220\'20\'1CSupplementation with vitamin D and tryptophan [which is made into serotonin in the brain] is a practical and affordable solution to help autism and possibly ameliorate some of the symptoms of the disorder."\par \par \uc2 But the vitamin D jigsaw puzzle is not finished yet. Some 15 or more different cancers have been consistently associated with low vitamin D levels in a way that accords with established criteria, according to epidemiologist Dr William B Grant, from the non-profit organisation the Sunlight Nutrition and Health Research Center in California. In his paper published in 2009, the link is most clearly seen in breast and bowel cancer. Insufficient vitamin D leads to loss of control of several genes which regulate proliferation of cancer cells and inhibit the cell cycle.\par \par \uc2 In fact there are more than 900 genes that Vitamin D is now known to switch on and off - and in doing so alters our vulnerability to disease. The large number of genes involved explains how so many quite different diseases can be caused by insufficient sunshine. In this way sunshine exposure directly alters the action of genes which may actually be passed on in their altered state \u8211\'20\'13 a newly understood process known as epigenetics. So it is possible to see how some diseases may emerge for the first time in one generation and be passed on to the next.\par \par \uc2 There is understandable opposition to these theories from some in the medical establishment. In an editorial published last December,the journal The Lancet argued that failure of \u8220\'20\'1Cgold standard" clinical trials of vitamin D to treat disease in adults disproves the possibility that insufficient vitamin D is a causal factor.\par \par \uc2 In my view, this ignores a wealth of experimental and observational evidence associating low vitamin D levels with higher risk of certain diseases. Also, vitamin D given in adulthood cannot necessarily be expected to cure a condition that has arisen through lack of vitamin D in early life. This is an error in scientific reasoning which I call the The Lancet\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cgold standard fallacy".\par \par \uc2 INDOOR LIFESTYLES BLAMED\par \par \uc2 At the same time researchers are finding links between vitamin D and chronic disease, the world is facing an epidemic of these same conditions, caused by our indoor lifestyles. Even in the height of summer people in cities often have sub-optimal levels of vitamin D, and so babies born at any time of year may develop these diseases. It\u8217\'20\'19s well recognised that multiple sclerosis has become increasingly common in the UK over the last century. Today, in cloudy Orkney, off the north of Scotland, one in 150 women suffer from MS, believed to be the highest prevalence in the world.\par \par \uc2 Less well known is that a generation ago the disease was much less common in southern than in northern Europe. But MS has increased rapidly in the Mediterranean over recent years, reflecting the increased movement of people away from rural subsistence farming to town and a life in urban apartments. In the Greek island of Crete MS has increased almost four fold over the last generation.\par \par \uc2 One striking example of the rise in MS is in Iran where, after the Islamic revolution in 1979, women were compelled by law to wear the veil outdoors together with clothing covering most of the body. Between 1989 and 2006, the incidence of MS in Iran increased more than eight fold, from an incidence of about one case in 100,000 to nearly one in 10,000 in the city of Isfahan.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Islamic revolution can potentially explain the observed increase in MS incidence in Iran in just over 30 years," said Dr Ramagopalan. \u8220\'20\'1CVeiled women have lower vitamin D levels compared to unveiled women, giving an increased risk of low vitamin D in pregnancy which can account for the increase in MS."\par \par \uc2 There have been similar increases in other autoimmune diseases, some rare or even unknown a century ago. Type 1 diabetes has seen an annual 4 per cent increase across Europe in a generation, with larger increases in the under-fives and the number of cases in this age group expected to double between 2005 and 2020. Crohn\u8217\'20\'19s disease, a life threatening inflammation of the bowel, has since the 1930s become increasingly common in most developed countries.\par \par \uc2 Between 1965 and 1997 the incidence of schizophrenia doubled in London\u8217\'20\'19s Camberwell. Much, but not all, of the increase is attributed to second generation dark-skinned \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who have a five times greater risk of the disease than their parents or people with white skin. Dark skin blocks absorption of weak northern sunlight, preventing vitamin D synthesis.\par \par \uc2 Autism was also rarity a generation ago. Between 1988 and 1995 the incidence in UK children increased some five fold, according to a nationwide survey by a 1000 GPs; arguably such a large rise cannot all be explained as improvements or changes in diagnosis of the condition, which is generally held to be difficult to miss. A similar increase occurred in the United States in the 1990s.\par \par \uc2 Over the last generation there has also been a global increase in asthma. Tests on frozen blood show that the epidemic is not caused by changes in diagnosis. Allergic reactions to mixed pollens, animal dander and house dust mites have increased by 4.5 per cent per decade in the UK during last quarter of the 20th epidemic has been followed closely by a rapid increase in food allergy. In extreme cases allergy can cause anaphylactic shock which has increased in England by 50 per cent between 2001 and 2005.\par \par \uc2 Professionals dealing with overflowing clinics are talking about a 'double tsunami\u8217\'20\'19 \u8211\'20\'13 a giant wave of asthma followed by a second wave of food allergy, suggesting that they are two parts of a continuing epidemic. Two distinguished professors, Augusto Litonjua and Scot Weiss, from Harvard University School of Medicine calculate that some 300 million people worldwide now suffer from asthma and blame social changes: \u8220\'20\'1C...as populations grow more prosperous and more westernised", they say, \u8220\'20\'1Cmore time is spent indoors and there is less exposure to sunlight, leading to vitamin D deficiency, subsequently resulting in more asthma and allergy."\par \par \uc2 Why has the wave of food allergy followed the wave of asthma rather than occurring simultaneously: and why are second generation \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  more at risk of diseases such as schizophrenia or Crohn\u8217\'20\'19s than their first generation parents? The new science of epigenetics explains how the environment can influence genes which are then passed on in an altered state, in apparent contradiction of classical genetics.\par \par \uc2 Women who are severely vitamin D deficient may pass on de-activated genes, which make their children more vulnerable to disease. Multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, Crohn\u8217\'20\'19s, schizophrenia, autism, asthma and food allergy have all been increasing in the same overlapping time frame and all have links to low vitamin D and low sunshine exposure. A further 11 autoimmune diseases have been linked to serious vitamin D deficiency in an Oxford study published in BMC Medicine in 2013. This makes at least 18 autoimmune diseases clearly linked to low vitamin D levels - more than enough to demonstrate a pattern.\par \par \uc2 PREVENTION IS CRUCIAL\par \par \uc2 Although The Lancet may insist otherwise, some clinical trials have shown that people with MS, asthma or Crohn\u8217\'20\'19s may do better or have fewer relapses when they take vitamin D, if disease is not too advanced. For example, MS begins with optic neuritis, a temporary form of blindness, in 20 per cent of cases. Doctors at Isfahan University, Iran, have shown in a clinical trial that giving vitamin D (about 7,000 IUs per day) at this early stage can reduce risk of a relapse in blindness by 68 per cent and lower the incidence of lesions and \u8220\'20\'1Cblack holes" in the brain. They are hopeful that vitamin D may delay the usual conversion of optic neuritis to subsequent MS. Symptoms of Crohns\u8217\'20\'19 disease can be reduced dramatically by 5,000 IUs per day of vitamin D according to a clinical trial at the Center for Molecular Immunology, \uc2 University of Pennsylvania\uc2 . Another study at \uc2 Massachusetts General Hospital\uc2 , described in the journal Inflammatory Bowel Disease, 2013, shows that risk of surgery is reduced in Crohns\u8217\'20\'19 patients who took a vitamin D supplement that increased their blood level to normal.\par \par \uc2 While the Lancet remains trapped in its \u8220\'20\'1Cgold standard" fallacy, doctors working with these autoimmune diseases, previously sceptical, are now privately hopeful that vitamin D will prove to be a useful addition to treatment. But increasing vitamin D later in life cannot always restore what has been lost when vitamin levels are low: for example, in the case of diabetes type 1, an enterovirus may attack the islet cells in the pancreas that make insulin, wiping them out. This is why prevention is so crucial: the link between high vitamin D levels in pregnancy and a reduction in diabetes risk was shown as long ago as 2001.\par \par \uc2 BRITAIN'S CLOUDY SKIES ARE BAD NEWS\par \par \uc2 THE UK has least sunshine of almost any advanced economy; our cloudy weather is arguably one of the unhealthiest climates in the world. And even when the sun shines we spend too much time indoors, detained by our computers and TVs. Fear of sunlight has been spread by misguided advice from cancer charities urging people to \u8220\'20\'1Cseek the shade" rather than enjoy the sun safely and often. Extensive use of suncreams since the 1970s, has reduced exposure to UVB, the part of sunlight which generates vitamin D. The Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, has said she is \u8220\'20\'1Cprofoundly ashamed" at the return of rickets in the UK. But the increase in rickets is small compared with the pandemic of immune system disease, the cost of which can be calculated in billions. MS costs the UK \u163\'00\'A33 billion a year, type 1 diabetes \u163\'00\'A39 billion, and schizophrenia \u163\'00\'A312 billion\par \par \uc2 IN 1942, when Britain was besieged by German submarines, the government was eager to maintain the nation\u8217\'20\'19s health by providing all children with cod liver oil, the best natural source of vitamin D. Since then successive governments have pursued a false economy and restricted free supplies of vitamin D supplements to a small percentage of pregnant and breastfeeding women and under-fives who are on state benefits.\par \par \uc2 I believe a great advance could be made by returning to heroic wartime thinking, providing all pregnant women and babies with free vitamin D supplements. I would argue that an intensive programme reaching 80-90 per cent of people, as modern vaccinations do, would greatly reduce and might even virtually eradicate MS, type 1 diabetes and several other autoimmune diseases.\par \par \uc2 Even lesser measures could at least halt or slow the pandemic. At little cost, the government could encourage voluntary fortification of foods such as milk and bread with vitamin D and give better advice on benefits of sunshine and how to enjoy the sun safely. Failure to act soon will be a cause for profound national shame.\par \par \uc2 Oliver Gillie is an award-winning writer and scientist.

\par\par \uc2 NEWS\par \b \uc2 Crime cases citing human rights increase by a third; Government under increasing pressure to curb 'human rights' abuse of laws by convicted prisoners and illegal \uc2 immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By Tom Whitehead Security Editor   \par \uc2 786 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par 08:56\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The number of criminals, migrants and others exploiting human rights laws has increased by almost a third despite Government pledges to crack down.\par \par \uc2 Human rights were cited in a total of 367 court cases last year compared to 283 in the previous 12 months, with the majority involving criminal or \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  matters.\par \par \uc2 However the figures show that the influence is now spreading to all aspects of law after the number of tax cases which invoked human rights laws doubled.\par \par \uc2 One leading campaigner on Sunday warned the figures show that wholesale reform of the laws is now needed.\par \par \uc2 The increase comes as pressure grows on the Government to curb the abuse of the laws by some sections such as convicted prisoners and illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ministers have tried to stop foreign criminals and illegal migrants from using the right to family life to avoid deportation but the courts have regularly ignored new rules.\par \par \uc2 The latest figures, obtained by Thomson Reuters legal business, show the problem continues to increase, with a 30 per cent increase in cases in just 12 months.\par \par \uc2 Dominic Raab, the Tory MP and campaigner for reform, said: \u8220\'20\'1CAnyone who thinks the problem of our skewed human rights laws is going away has their head in the sand.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe rights inflation, driven by judicial legislation from Strasbourg and the Human Rights Act, is eating away at our law enforcement and deportation capacity.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe need to grasp the nettle, and overhaul the law."\par \par \uc2 Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, said: "The Convention on Human Rights was drawn up in the aftermath of the horror of the Second World War, with the noble intention of protecting people's fundamental rights \u8211\'20\'13 such as the right not to be tortured or the right to a fair trial for example.\par \par \uc2 "But it seems a bit of a damming indictment of Labour's Human Rights Act that now it is being used as such a ready recourse for people wanting to bring claims for issues that would have been far from the minds of the Convention's original creators."\par \par \uc2 Last year it emerged that the terrorism suspect who evaded police by wearing a burka was suing the Government for allegedly breaching his human rights.\par \par \uc2 Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed remains at large but his lawyers are still suing the Government for alleged mistreatment during his arrest and detention in Somaliland in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Figures in November also suggested that thousands of foreigners arrested in Britain are routinely avoiding deportation.\par \par \uc2 Theresa May, the Home Secretary, has said the Conservatives will pledge to repeal the Human Rights Act at the next general election.\par \par \uc2 However, in January, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , with the help of Labour and the Liberal Democrats, blocked a Conservative back \u8211\'20\'13 bench move to toughen human rights laws.\par \par \uc2 More than 90 Conservative MPs voted for an amendment to the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Bill intended to make it harder for foreign criminals to avoid deportation but Mr Cameron had said the plan was unlawful.\par \par \uc2 Tom Hickman, a barrister at Blackstone Chambers and human rights expert, said: \u8220\'20\'1CThere continues to be an ongoing discussion over the Human Rights Act place in the British judicial system and whether it should be replaced by a UK Bill of Rights. It is expected that proposed changes will be debated at the next general election.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSince the Human Rights Act was introduced it is playing an important role in achieving legal redress increasingly in the commercial field.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhile the use of the Act still leads to controversy with high profile cases such as the right for prisoners to have the vote, in the majority of cases the Human Rights Act is now seen as an accepted area of law by lawyers and the judiciary."\par \par \uc2 The latest survey showed that the number of tax-related court cases involving human rights claims increased from 12 to 25.\par \par \uc2 They included a taxpayer who had been fined for submitting their PAYE accounts too late argued that the fine breached their right to property.\par \par \uc2 Another taxpayer who lied on his tax returns about his company\u8217\'20\'19s sales to reduce his tax bill successfully argued that his right to property meant that \uc2 HM Revenue and Customs\uc2  could not recover more than the value of tax he had saved by lying.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hickman added: \u8220\'20\'1CLitigants feel the need to raise every point they properly can so it is not surprising that they seek to develop Human Rights arguments in the area of tax litigation \u8211\'20\'13 especially when the sums of money at stake can be very substantial often running into the millions."\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140310ea3a001e2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Editorial; Opinion, Columns\par \b \uc2 The main parties don't listen to the working classes\b0\par\par\uc2 Nigel Farage   \par \uc2 1,064 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par \uc2 London Evening Standard\par \uc2 NS\par \uc2 1; National\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Evening Standard Limited   \par \par \uc2 Ukip is drawing support not just from disaffected Tories \u8212\'20\'14 its message now resonates with voters from all sides\par \par \uc2 IDON'T really like talking about the strategy and tactics of the Conservative Party \u8212\'20\'14 why intrude on private grief ? My preferred approach is to get on with spreading the positive Ukip message and picking up extra support.\par \par \uc2 But something the Tories have been saying in recent weeks really does need countering. It is the idea that Ukip voters belong at some deep level to the Conservative Party and that by luring them away, Ukip is in danger of putting a Left-wing Labour government into power by default. Vote Ukip, get Miliband, say people such as Grant Shapps (I think that is the name the Tory chairman is using these days).\par \par \uc2 Let's set aside for a moment the appalling arrogance and complacency the Tories have shown towards those alienated former voters who do now back our party. They are not owned by the Conservative Party and have rumbled \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  for not being a Conservative anyway.\par \par \uc2 The point is that the idea of Ukip fishing for votes predominantly from the Tory pond is plain wrong. To listen to received wisdom inside the Westminster bubble you would think the typical Ukip voter is a retired half-colonel living on the edge of Salisbury Plain.\par \par \uc2 I know that if there ever was anything in that stereotype there certainly isn't any longer. Anyone who attended the Evening Standard's \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate last week will readily appreciate the point I am making.\par \par \uc2 There were lots of Labour-minded people in that audience who supported Ukip's position on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . It is not that Labour politicians such as Tessa Jowell and David Lammy \u8212\'20\'14 who were on the panel that night \u8212\'20\'14 have taken a conscious decision to stop speaking for working-class people. It is that they are so out of touch that they just do not know how to speak for working-class people any more.\par \par \uc2 One Labour supporter in the audience that night made the point most passionately: the party had been blind to the impact of uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  on working people and he was now going to support Ukip.\par \par \uc2 It was a shock to hear Lammy pick up and run with the idea, popular among the political class, that British youngsters are somehow lazy, feckless and are not prepared to take low-paid work in order to get on to the first rung of the jobs ladder.\par \par \uc2 I know that in the great majority of instances that is totally untrue. Most of our school-leavers are desperate to work but they have been blown out of the water by an endless stream of Eastern European migrants who are older, often better qualified and ready to share bedrooms in shifts while they are getting established.\par \par \uc2 My way of doing politics has focused on meeting and listening to people who live outside the Westminster bubble. I have gone around the country while at all times seeking to avoid doing what Willie Whitelaw once referred to as "stirring up apathy". And I have found that people are desperate to talk about political issues.\par \par \uc2 The media gives the impression that my normal mode is transmit, and indeed I did a lot of talking on my common sense tour which took me the length and breadth of England in the run-up to the local elections last spring. But I was in "receive" mode for a lot of the time as well. Listening to people voice their concerns on the street, in public halls and, yes, the occasional public house as well. I talked to lorry drivers and building site workers, butchers and bakers, farm labourers and security guards, shop assistants and cleaners.\par \par \uc2 And everywhere I heard the same thing: wages falling ever further behind the cost of living for year after year; people being undercut by migrant workers; grown-up children unable to find any work at all let alone move out and afford a place of their own; energy bills and food bills out of control; hardworking people being dragged into hardship.\par \par \uc2 No wonder some of Ukip's best by-election performances have come in neglected Labour heartlands \u8212\'20\'14 in Rotherham, South Shields and Wythenshawe & Sale East. Even as long ago as the 2009 European elections, most of our topperforming areas were in Labour parliamentary constituencies. A giant poll by Populus published last week found that "Ukip's support is drawn disproportionately from working-class and lower-middle-class voters". As the academics Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford put it: "Ukip has raised as many questions for Labour as for the Tories."\par \par \uc2 Goodwin and Ford are among the few to have noticed that: "A new electorate of 'left behind' voters has grown up. These voters are on the wrong side of social change, are struggling on stagnant incomes, feel threatened by the way their communities and country are changing, and are furious at an established politics that appears not to understand or even care about their concerns. And it is these left-behind voters who have finally found a voice in Farage's revolt." I couldn't have put it much better myself.\par \par \uc2 The truth is that unless Ed Miliband promises at the very least an EU referendum \u8212\'20\'14 thereby giving people the prospect of being able to vote for Britain to take back control of its own borders \u8212\'20\'14 Labour will be extremely vulnerable to Ukip, not just in the European elections but in the general election next year too.\par \par \uc2 It may very well be Ukip that deprives Labour of an overall majority in the Commons. We are the only political force vigorous enough to perform that service for the nation because the Conservatives under Mr Cameron are a spent force, following their leader over the edge of a cliff.\par \par \uc2 As we showed in the local elections last year, the truth of the matter is that if you vote Ukip, then these days you get Ukip too. We will show it again in the European elections in May. And if anyone thinks we are going to fade away for the general election then I can assure them: they have another think coming.\par \par \uc2 Some of Ukip's best by-election performances have come in neglected Labour heartlands\par \par \uc2 Document NS00000020140310ea3a0000m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

He is reported to be entitled to a pension of at least \u163\'00\'A350,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 It emerged today that Judge McKee quit after being challenged by his bosses about giving financial support to a Nigerian woman, Fatimah Umar, who was apparently living at his flat in Kilburn.\par \par \uc2 Umar, 39, was arrested in January for causing \u163\'00\'A35,000 of criminal damage at the property, a Scotland Yard spokesman said today. She is serving an eightweek jail term after pleading guilty at Hendon magistrates' court to one count of criminal damage and three of assaulting three police officers.\par \par \uc2 According to The Sun, Ms Umar was found to have overstayed her UK visa. People found to have "overstayed" normally face deportation.\par \par \uc2 A Judiciary spokeswoman said: "On January 31 it was brought to the Chamber President's attention that Upper Tribunal Judge McKee was providing financial support to a person who was alleged to be an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  offender. This was put to Mr McKee who then retired with effect from February 4."\par \par \uc2 The Office for Judicial Complaints said he had been reprimanded as he had "fallen short of the standards expected of all judicial office holders".\par \par \uc2 Document NS00000020140310ea3a0004h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Ukip MEPs were asked to divert funds from their Brussels salaries and allowances to the party\u8217\'20\'19s central office, it has emerged.\par \par \uc2 MEPs were told to give \u8220\'20\'1Ca minimum of \u163\'00\'A310,000 per annum" to the party\u8217\'20\'19s coffers in an email sent to the party\u8217\'20\'19s MEPs by Alan Bown, a Ukip donor and member of the party\u8217\'20\'19s National Executive Committee.\par \par \uc2 Funding domestic political activities with \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  allowances may breach rules that require such expenses to be directly linked to the work of an MEP\u8217\'20\'19s office.\par \par \uc2 The email, sent in June 2011, said: \u8220\'20\'1CMost MEPs drew a salary of \u163\'00\'A380k+ per year plus generous expenses of approximately \u163\'00\'A3320k, some of which does not require receipts."\par \par \uc2 Mr Bown said it costs the part \u163\'00\'A3125,000 to get each MEP elected but many have a \u8220\'20\'1Cvery poor record of helping the party financially."\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSome MEPs do an excellent job for the party, but with some of them we have to ask ourselves whether they are good value for money at \u163\'00\'A3125,000," the Times quoted him as writing.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the party insisted its MEPs did not break any rules.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CUkip MEPs who donate to party funds do so out of their own post-tax salaries. Ukip MEPs work for withdrawal from the EU just as they promised the voters that they would when elected in 2009. For the avoidance of doubt, Ukip MEPs are careful to observe European parliamentary rules when spending resources on advancing the goal of British withdrawal."\par \par \uc2 It comes as a new analysis shows up to 30 per cent of voters could potentially be drawn to the party, meaning the party has far from peaked.\par \par \uc2 Three in ten voters are either eurosceptic and against \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , or eurosceptic and politically dissatisfied, leaving them open to voting for Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party, according to research by academics Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CUKIP are currently winning over one voter in ten but their potential far exceeds their current support in the polls by a margin of three to one," said Dr Ford. \u8220\'20\'1CThis revolt has been a long time coming, but may have a long way to run."\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140310ea3a0020e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Nick Clegg v Nigel Farage? The Ukip leader must be licking his lips\b0\par\par\uc2 John Harris   \par \uc2 theguardian.com\par \uc2 1,260 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par \uc2 Guardian.co.uk\par \uc2 GRULTD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Guardian News & Media Limited. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 John Harris: The Lib Dem leader embodies everything Ukip voters take against. Only Clegg could pick himself as the man to turn them round\par \par \uc2 Fans of ham acting, broken promises and political phone-ins will presumably be delighted that Nick Clegg has insisted he will remain as Lib Dem leader "through the whole of the next parliament" until 2020, whether or not the Lib Dems are part of the next government. Devotees of the absurd, meanwhile, may well be delighted by news that Danny Alexander is reportedly "positioning himself" for a leadership bid at some unspecified point in the future, but let's park that one.\par \par \uc2 Fair play to Clegg, perhaps: though opinion polls recurrently show his party bumbling along at around 9%, his quest and that of his colleagues to begin differentiating themselves from the Tories is being energetically pursued, and in moments of weakness one might imagine them avoiding wipeout in 2015, and the leader remaining in post. Or perhaps not: even their own people have acknowledged that they face disaster in next month's European and local elections, which would cap a run of electoral disasters and thus highlight grim auguries for the general election. You can surely see it coming: the party pushed back into a few West Country redoubts, Clegg summarily sent on his way, and a new job for that proud defender of the orange flame, Tim Farron.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, by way of suggesting that his party is the same principled force it ever was and running towards the sound of gunfire, Clegg has decided to pick a fight with Ukip \u8211\'20\'13 and more specifically Nigel Farage. He will debate Britain's place in Europe with Farage at 7pm on Wednesday 2 April (on BBC2, presumably so as to not to mess with The One Show). And at the Lib Dems' spring conference over the weekend, he fired some rhetorical buckshot at his new quarry.\par \par \uc2 "An ungenerous, backwards-looking politics has emerged in Britain," Clegg said. "The politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub. So I'm drawing a line in the sand. I am going to defend the tolerant and modern Britain we love." EU-wise, he said, "the Liberal Democrats are now Britain's only party of IN". The block capitals are there in the official transcript: the Lib Dems' love of Brussels is unabashed that they do not want in, but IN. By way of illustrating all this, one Lib Dem MP was sensibly photographed at the conference in a Farage mask, holding the obligatory pint and fag, apparently so as to illustrate how feeble the party's latest enemy is. How we laughed, and all that.\par \par \uc2 There will, obviously, be big problems with all this. Last time Clegg attached himself to a noble cause \u8211\'20\'13 electoral reform, remember? \u8211\'20\'13 his presence ensured that the issue took its place in a mess of other grievances, about his broken vow on tuition fees, the Lib Dems' acquiescence in austerity, and his own alleged uselessness. And when it comes to Europe, much the same thing will happen, but on exactly the terms that Ukip would like. In other words, the noise surrounding this debate, not to mention the TV duel, will only partly be about whether Britain should be in Europe or not: the rest of it, one would imagine, will centre on the issue of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , both in terms of its links with the EU, and as a public concern that informs just about every other area of policy \u8211\'20\'13 and, implicitly or otherwise, the sense a lot of people have that we are governed by a homogeneous, well-heeled, cosseted bunch of politicians, and among the only people who offer any kind of alternative is Farage, complete with his pint and fag.\par \par \uc2 Now, it's not like the political class had an extraordinary annual general meeting and appointed Clegg as its new anti-Farage attack dog: with his customary chutzpah, he simply appointed himself to the role. But could you imagine a more perfect embodiment of everything Ukip voters take against?\par \par \uc2 Actually, I could: Harriet Harman springs to mind. But anyway: it's worth taking seriously the analysis proffered by the authors of Revolt On The Right, the impressive-looking new book on Ukip, who reckon that Ukip draws heavily on the support of "working-class, white male voters" who "feel left behind by Britain's rapid economic and social transformation and left out of our political conversation; struggling people who feel like strangers in a society whose ruling elites do not talk like them or value the things which matter to them". Some of us would argue that they have a point. But even if they don't, would anyone pick Nick Clegg \u8211\'20\'13 Nick Clegg! \u8211\'20\'13 to somehow turn them round?\par \par \uc2 Farage should chuck another few percentage points on his poll rating, it seems to me. And come the big debate, unless his opponent manages to summon up the ghost of Cleggmania, even on the substantive issues, he will do much better than some people would like to think. Like so many modern politicians, Clegg tends to resemble a one-man school play about Tony Blair. He has the same tendency to piety, a similar style of speechifying, and the same habit of briefly acknowledging that a given issue is more complex than he himself sometimes seems to think, before making everything sound blissfully simple. There was a sense of his basic pitch in Sunday's speech: a rather cringe-inducing tribute to our national character, a brief mention of that fact that the EU "needs reform", and then a tick-list of why we should stay in: jobs, the fight against climate change, the need to catch international criminals, and the idea that Britain stands "tallest in the world when we stand tall in Brussels, Paris and Berlin".\par \par \uc2 Before I wrote this, I sat in my local caff with my customary cup of English breakfast tea (too early for a pint and fag, you understand), and read the latest issue of the Economist. There's a very good essay in it about the worldwide prospects for democracy, and an eye-catching paragraph about how much the EU has let people down on that score: "The decision to introduce the euro in 1999 was taken largely by technocrats; only two countries, Denmark and Sweden, held referendums on the matter (both said no). Efforts to win popular approval for the Lisbon treaty, which consolidated power in Brussels, were abandoned when people started voting the wrong way. During the darkest days of the euro crisis the Euro elite forced Italy and Greece to replace democratically elected leaders with technocrats \u8230\'20\'26"\par \par \uc2 And so it goes on. It may be the case that, as Clegg says, an "ungenerous, backwards-looking politics has emerged in Britain". As it grows in popularity, Farage's party undoubtedly has all kinds of questions to answer, and it may yet wither in the spotlight. But at the same time, a lot of British people have a keen sense of the kind of oppressive behaviour of which the EU is more than capable, and the associated arguments for Eurosceptism, and even our outright exit. And here is today's question: is the Lib Dem leader really the man to persuade them otherwise? Well?\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140310ea3a0025t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

We asked our columnists this question and here's what they had to say\b0\par\par\uc2 Laura Davis   \par \uc2 665 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par 11:57\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Grace Dent: Right:\u160\'00\'A0recognised that marriage equality for gay people was the cornerstone of a fairer, happier society.\u160\'00\'A0Wrong: sneered at food banks and the hungry individuals using them. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Jane Merrick: Right: undoubtedly, the economy. George Osborne\u8217\'20\'19s austerity strategy of last three years was proven right and recovery is underway. Wrong: the flipside of this is believing that the economy is protected from another housing bubble, which all the experts say it is not.\par \par \uc2 Archie Bland: I can't think of a nastier innovation than the new rule stating that you have to earn at least \u163\'00\'A318,600 to sponsor your spouse for a Visa: it will split up thousands of families, and distributes rights according to income. They got it right on gay marriage, and about time.\par \par \uc2 Lisa Markwell: I have measured support for the free school movement because it has allowed special schools for children with disabilities and different needs to be catered for (although in other aspects, education has been royally ballsed up). What it got wrong look as if it might have been right \u8211\'20\'13 Help to Buy fired up the property market, just as we needed\u8230\'20\'26 but it went too far and now we are in panic mode.\par \par \uc2 Yasmin Alibhai-Brown: Stood up to populism and kept its international aid budget. The list is too long for what the Government got wrong - but worst of all was making poverty a crime.\par \par \uc2 John Rentoul: David Cameron's promise in January of a referendum on Europe was right in democratic principle and in historical necessity. The Help to Buy scheme by which government guaranteed home loans was stupid on stilts.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Andreas Whittam Smith: Putting the plan to make a military intervention in Syria to a vote in the House of Commons and accepting the negative result.\par \par \uc2 Ellen E Jones: I'm very happy that legislation to allow same-sex marriage was passed this July. \u160\'00\'A0Nick Clegg's Christmas card was also quite amusing. Wrong: pretty much everything else, but in particular exacerbating the housing crisis with Help to Buy and exacerbating poverty with the systematic dismantling of the welfare state. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Stefano Hatfield: Right: keeping interest rates low, falling unemployment, presenting UK as a good place to do business for multi-nationals, reaching out to China, gay marriage, maintaining commitment to overseas aid. Wrong: Bedroom Tax, endless and incompetent tinkering with exam system, misguided A&E closures, HS2, failure to clamp down on zero hours contracts, blindness to wage poverty, blindness to housing market bubble and the suffering it causes, constant false dialogue about shirkers and \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , refusal to tackle Big Six energy providers.\par \par \uc2 Owen Jones: Right: the lifting of the ban on same-sex couples marrying. The fact this happened with the Tories in office - despite their history of supporting homophobic laws, and many of their MPs being stuck in the 18th century - shows how far this country has come. But the real credit should go to the LGBT activists, often airbrushed out of history, who fought for equality despite facing ridicule and persecution, and at great cost and sacrifice to themselves. Wrong: Virtually everything else. A quarter of women in work now slave away for poverty wages. Half a million people depend on food banks. A million families a month are dependent on another booming industry, legal loan sharks. The Big Six energy companies are able to hold millions of consumers to ransom. The jobs being created are low-wage, temporary, zero-hour or part-time. This is also the worst so-called economic recovery for over a century. The sooner we get rid of this rabble, the better.\par \par \uc2 Read our columnists' answers to these questions:\par \par \uc2 What will 2013 be remembered for?\par \par \uc2 Who is your person of the year?\par \par \uc2 What\u8217\'20\'19s the best thing you\u8217\'20\'19ve read this year?\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140310ea3a00336\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Voices\par \b \uc2 Who is your person of the year? We asked our columnists this question and here's what they had to say\b0\par\par\uc2 Laura Davis   \par \uc2 467 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par 11:57\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Grace Dent: Nigella Lawson. For her dignity and strength.\par \par \uc2 Jane Merrick: Anna Soubry - today's leading centre-ground politician, when the three party leaders spend their time tacking left then right. A Conservative MP (and first female Defence Minister) who gave a passionate speech (on Question Time) about how great \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  have been for our country.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Archie Bland: Southampton's manager Mauricio Pochettino, although I'm biased. If he's not allowed, Malala.\par \par \uc2 Lisa Markwell: Jack Monroe, who writes the blog A Girl Called Jack about feeding herself and her toddler son on \u163\'00\'A310 a week. In the last year she has achieved fame (and notoriety) for becoming independent, vocal and a real force for change. She has a book coming out next year, drew a standing ovation at the Tory party conference (no mean feat) and created a petition which has led to a question in the House on poverty in the UK. She\u8217\'20\'19s received a ton of flak from right-wing newspaper columnists and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  trolls, but continues to speak, clearly, for many who would otherwise be unheard. Her recipes are ace too.\par \par \uc2 Yasmin Alibhai-Brown: David Tennant: the roles he inhabits, from Dr Who to Richard II, make him among the greatest actors ever. He does it without obvious egotism.\par \par \uc2 John Rentoul: Nick Foles, substitute quarterback for the \uc2 Philadelphia Eagles\uc2 , who took over from an injured Michael Vick and has pulled the team back into contention for the play-offs.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Andreas Whittam Smith: Pope Francis.\par \par \uc2 Ellen E Jones: The US senator Wendy Davis stood up for all of us this year.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Stefano Hatfield: Possibly Mandela in his death, but probably the new Pope, who does seem like a genuine breath of fresh air, Vladimir Putin for his absolute grip on power and disdain for international opponents.\par \par \uc2 Owen Jones: All of those who fought back. UKUncut, who took to the streets over the cuts to legal aid. Disabled People Against The Cuts, courageously fighting the intolerable treatment of disabled people. Firefighters, who save countless lives each year, on strike for basic fairness. Feminists like Caroline Criado-Perez, fighting misogyny and sexism and often facing a vile backlash. The People's Assembly groups in communities across the country fighting austerity. And Nelson Mandela, a man persecuted in his day, who now the whole world is falling over to claim as their own, including people who made the struggle against Apartheid longer, harder and deadlier.\par \par \uc2 Read our columnists' answers to these questions:\par \par \uc2 What did the Government get right in 2013?

It includes the quote \u8220\'20\'1Ctalk the language that they understand".\par \par \uc2 Security analysts believe the proposed publication is part of a renewed effort to recruit and inspire Western jihadis to carry out attacks on their home soil.\par \par \uc2 Magnus Ranstorp, a terrorism expert at Swedish National Defence College, told the Telegraph that the decision to use Malcolm X dialogue was significant.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIts simplicity appeals in many ways. It focuses on the raw emotions of victimhood in the Muslim world which reinforces the \uc2 al-Qa'ida\uc2  narrative that the West is aggressively at war with Islam," he said.\par \par \uc2 The use of English, he said, reinforced the idea it was directed at second and third generation \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  as well as converts.\par \par \uc2 Evan Kohlmann, a terrorism analyst for NBC News, told the broadcaster that the magazine appears to have been influenced by Inspire, an English-language magazine reported to be published by the terrorist organisation in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).\par \par \uc2 Inspire, which features articles such as "How To Make A Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom", was allegedly the source of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u8217\'20\'19s plans to build the pressure cooker devices that killed three people and injured around 264 others at the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013.\par \par \uc2 Al-Qa'ida\uc2 's announcement comes at a time when the terrorist organisation has been devastated by drone strikes and the loss of its leader, Osama bin Laden, in May 2011.\par \par \uc2 The United States has stepped up drone strikes as part of a campaign against the militant group in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), regarded by Washington as the most active wing of the network.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday \uc2 al-Qa\u8217\'20\'19ida\uc2  militants shot dead a man in southeastern Yemen for allegedly giving the United States information used to carry out drone strikes.\par \par \uc2 Read more:\uc2 Al-Qa'ida\uc2  executes Yemeni man accused of acting as a spy for the USSocial media is new weapon in war on British jihadis\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140310ea3a0035z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 CULTURE\par \b \uc2 C\u233\'00\'E9zanne and the Modern, Ashmolean Museum, review; The collection of a cold-storage insulation salesman, on display at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, is full of Post-Impressionist masterpieces, says Alastair Sooke\b0\par\par\uc2 By Alastair Sooke   \par \uc2 1,074 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par 12:32\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 One January morning in 1945, a few months short of his 50th birthday, an American businessman called Henry Pearlman walked into an auction house in New York and bid successfully on a painting. The picture he had bought was View of C\u233\'00\'E9ret, a wild landscape by the Expressionist painter Cha\u239\'00\'EFm Soutine.\par \par \uc2 With its \u8220\'20\'1Cblue, yellow and golden colours slashed on as if by a trowel", as Pearlman later described it, this canvas would have been a bold acquisition for any collector, let alone a self-made cold-storage insulation salesman and baseball fan who was the son of Russian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and had received no training in art history.\par \par \uc2 Yet the moment he saw that Soutine, Pearlman decided to devote himself to modern art. Over the next three decades, until his death in 1974, he amassed a remarkable collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and modern paintings and sculptures, including the 50 works of art in a new exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.\par \par \uc2 Like most collectors, Pearlman had idiosyncrasies. He was not interested in the art of his American contemporaries. He had no truck with abstract painting or Cubism. He bought Matisse\u8217\'20\'19s sombre yet magnificent Bathers by a River, which was finished during the First World War, but decided to get rid of it as soon as it was loaded onto the dock upon its arrival in America because it was almost 13 feet wide and, as he said later, \u8220\'20\'1CI couldn\u8217\'20\'19t possibly hang it anywhere". Surely his response should have been: it\u8217\'20\'19s time to buy a bigger house.\par \par \uc2 Pearlman did not mind relinquishing Bathers by a River, which he swapped for a Toulouse-Lautrec with the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.artic.edu/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Art Institute of Chicago}}}\uc2 , which still owns Matisse\u8217\'20\'19s vast masterpiece, but he should have done: reproduced in the catalogue, it haunts the exhibition at the Ashmolean like a phantom limb.\par \par \uc2 Instead of Matisse, Pearlman worshipped principally at the altar of C\u233\'00\'E9zanne. The core of his collection was an enviable group of 16 watercolours by the French Post-Impressionist that are presented in the first gallery at the Ashmolean. These are subtle, glittering works of art, suffused with unexpectedly large areas of cream and off-white, where the paper is allowed to shine through from the background, contributing to a general atmosphere of freshness and brightness.\par \par \uc2 Using this technique, C\u233\'00\'E9zanne could skilfully summon the lustrous skin of a pear, sunlight irradiating the fa\u231\'00\'E7ade of a house in Provence, or the bleached, luminous cranium of a skull. To accent the graphite design of his underdrawing, C\u233\'00\'E9zanne applied tiny patches and strips of translucent colour, like silk scarves shimmering in a summery breeze. These pictures have the evanescent, sparkling beauty of a dragonfly swooping before your eyes.\par \par \uc2 The second gallery is devoted to Pearlman\u8217\'20\'19s show-stopping oil paintings, including two by C\u233\'00\'E9zanne: a splendid, characteristic view of Mont Sainte-Victoire, and Cistern in the Park of Chateau Noir, a shadowy, speckled forest interior in which rich dabs of blue and green complement russets and oranges.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, as well as the Toulouse-Lautrec for which Pearlman exchanged Bathers by a River, we find an ambiguous portrait by Manet, in which a decidedly masculine woman with heavyset features and a shadow resembling a sideburn nestling beside her ear appears incongruously decked out in delicate, fashionable finery.\par \par \uc2 There is also Van Gogh\u8217\'20\'19s Tarascon Stagecoach, in which the vehicle\u8217\'20\'19s eye-catching, primrose-yellow wheels seem to be mired in impasto splodges of grey paint representing sand covering the courtyard of an inn. These marks are so thick that they appear almost edible, like cream cheese smeared on toast.\par \par \uc2 Despite a veneer of respectability, Pearlman occasionally demonstrated a penchant for sauce. Degas\u8217\'20\'19s After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself is an openly erotic painting, in which a woman on her knees bends forwards so that her buttocks occupy the centre of the composition. A startling line of vermilion cascades along the contours of her left arm, shoulders and neck, like a jolt of sexual electricity.\par \par \uc2 Near this picture is a wooden relief carved and painted by Gauguin and featuring a crouching, green-skinned prostitute with a rubbery red nipple and four strangely sensual red spots running down her back. In a prudish gesture, Pearlman got somebody to paint green tempera over the prostitute\u8217\'20\'19s exposed genitals, which were coloured a dark red, in order \u8220\'20\'1Cto make it palatable to the American public". It was only when the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz suggested that the composition was unbalanced that Pearlman had the tempera removed.\par \par \uc2 The final gallery contains several landscapes by Soutine, including the one that turned Pearlman on to modern art in the first place, as well as a couple of portraits by Modigliani. The latter\u8217\'20\'19s powerful image of Jean Cocteau presents the avant-garde Frenchman as the very picture of vanity, with his prissy, erect pose, elegant yet fastidious clothes and effete cupid\u8217\'20\'19s-bow lip. A prominent kink in his nose, as well as one sunken black eye, hints at the ugly self-regard beneath his manicured fa\u231\'00\'E7ade.\par \par \uc2 C\u233\'00\'E9zanne and the Modern, then, is full of wonderful art. Yet the story of Pearlman\u8217\'20\'19s collecting, which is offered as the exhibition\u8217\'20\'19s unifying subplot, is much less interesting than its organisers at the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Princeton University Art Museum}}}\uc2 , where his works of art are on long-term loan, would have us believe.\par \par \uc2 The catalogue reprints Pearlman\u8217\'20\'19s short memoir Reminiscences of a Collector. Down-to-earth and gossipy about the art trade, it is enjoyable but also striking for its lack of impassioned engagement. He doesn\u8217\'20\'19t attempt to explain why he considered himself a \u8220\'20\'1Cworshipper of C\u233\'00\'E9zanne", for instance. Instead, he prefers to talk about the cut and thrust of negotiating with wily dealers. I guess he was a businessman, after all.\par \par \uc2 As a result, C\u233\'00\'E9zanne and the Modern offers a reminder of the dispiriting way in which the market can diminish artworks by turning them into trophies for the very wealthy. Like Pearlman, I\u8217\'20\'19m happy to worship C\u233\'00\'E9zanne, but I don\u8217\'20\'19t see why we have to bow down before rich collectors as well.\par \par \uc2 From March 13 until June 22.

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg yesterday sought to quell the colleagues who are jockeying to replace him, declaring he will not step down as Liberal Democrat leader until 2020, come what may.\par \par \uc2 It's a bold claim. Few in the party think we would want, let alone be allowed, to stick around as the leader of a rump party if they lose half their seats and left out of power in 2015.\par \par \uc2 So who will succeed him?\par \par \uc2 There's one school that says after the pain of Coalition, the party's 42,000 members would want to replace Mr Clegg with someone in tune with their left-wing instincts; someone like Tim Farron, the plain-speaking party President whose hands have not been bloodied by a job in Government, backs the 50p top rate of the tax and who told the opening rally in York on Friday night that the Conservatives are "crackers" and "hysterical fantasists" on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But what if that base has changed?\par \par \uc2 The striking thing when you listen to delegates in York is how little dissent and discomfort there is at being in Coalition, and how closely activists' wish lists appear aligned with ministers'.\par \par \uc2 A caveat: If you didn't really like what the Liberal Democrats are doing in Government, after four years you'd probably just stay away rather than spend your weekend attempting to force a change of course. So these are the ultra-loyalists.\par \par \uc2 On Friday night David Laws, the schools minister, held a consultative session to gather ideas for the next manifesto. Over two hours, dozens of delegates stood to give their wish lists.\par \par \uc2 There were some old-school beard-and-sandals policies: re-regulating the buses, reforming the UN security council, switching local elections to the Single Transferable Vote system (the public's rejection of AV in a referendum an aberration) and installing solar panels on every home.\par \par \uc2 There was just one call to abandon austerity and walk away from the Tories. "Attacks on the poor and needy masquerading as welfare reforms has to go," said the delegate from Camberwell, to quiet sighs and a few rolled eyes.\par \par \uc2 But most of the suggestions were terribly on message \u8211\'20\'13 if not Tory.\par \par \uc2 Get fracking. Deregulate the planning system to boost house building. Build high speed rail. Upgrade rural broadband. Rebalance growth away from the south east, towards manufacturing and boost BRIC exports. Get small business invoices paid within a fortnight. Give tax breaks to stay-at-home mums. Raising the National Insurance threshold in line with income tax. Even Free Schools found a supporter. "We must put fixing the economy first. That's the country's priority," said one.\par \par \uc2 Strikingly, delegates urged Mr Laws not to put red lines around their most treasured policies when going into any Coalition negotiations, fearing a repeat of the humiliating climb-down on tuition fees.\par \par \uc2 I mentioned this to a minister, who smiled. "They like being in Government."\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140310ea3a002jx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 London is a playground for the rich - and the poor\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janan Ganesh   \par \uc2 868 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par 17:00\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 London has impressed itself upon the world as an imperial metropole, a financial hub, a destination for migrants - and now as a subject of moral panic. Excitable chronicles of this "billionaire's playground" have become a genre of foreign journalism in recent years.\par \par \uc2 According to these lurid dystopias, which have been given new life since Ukraine crisis, London is being hollowed out by venal and sometimes bloodstained plutocrats from countries steeped in authoritarianism. Entire streets stand empty - it is rarely specified which ones - as the mere investments or trophies of remote foreigners. Ordinary people flee the excruciating cost of everything. Between the overclass and the indentured workers who serve them (exactly how they serve them if they are not present is never explained) languishes a withered, resentful middle.\par \par \uc2 Against this kind of hysteria, only numbers will do. Between 2001 and 2011, London's population grew from 7.3m to 8.2m. It is expected to reach 9m before the decade is out. The only one of the 33 boroughs to experience a drop was Kensington and Chelsea, which lost 200 of its 158,000 residents. \uc2 Westminster council\uc2 , which includes Mayfair, Marylebone and other oligarch neighbourhoods, grew by 21 per cent.\par \par \uc2 The exact nature of London's population boom rebuts the gloominess as much as the mere fact of the boom. Fertility rates have driven up the numbers, not just \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . In other words, the city is becoming such a Babel of gaudiness and moral turpitude that lots of people choose to come here and existing residents choose to have lots of children here. As a way of registering their disapproval of the place, it is eccentric.\par \par \uc2 According to the annual Wealth Report by Knight Frank, a property consultancy, London has more ultra-wealthy individuals - those with at least $30m in assets, aside from their main home - than any other city in the world. Still, they number only 4,224. The notion that their comings and goings could affect the feeling of fullness in a city of more than 8m people does not even make sense in theory. For almost all Londoners almost all of the time, the presence or absence of foreign tycoons is not palpable at all. The only one most of them could name is Roman Abramovich, the owner of \uc2 Chelsea Football Club\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.\par \par \uc2 <>Whether London's unquestioning openness to outsiders is right or wrong, it is not new. In the 19th century, European regimes resented London for hosting exiled radicals trying to foment revolution across the continent. One of them - his name was Karl Marx - made his home in Hampstead. In the 1970s, there was snooty distaste as wealthy Arabs made London their home from home ("They owned Al-Klaridges, Al-Dorchester, Al-Browns . . . ." wrote Anthony Burgess in his dystopic novel 1985). The French sneered at "Londonistan" for its tolerance of Islamic radicals.\par \par \uc2 The idea that London was a fortress of gentlemanly values until a moral fall that occurred at some indistinct time around the millennium is ahistorical. It has always been open to the point of nihilism, hosting even troublemakers and scoundrels, some rich, some not. If that is lamentable, it was worth lamenting 30, 50 or 100 years ago. It should not be shown as a particular quirk of our age in frothy works of zeitgeist journalism.\par \par \uc2 Neither should we pretend that London's hospitability to globalisation does nothing for ordinary Londoners. Foreign investment and contributions from the City (which, given the internationalism of that financial centre, amounts to the same thing) are helping to pay for London's most extensive makeover since at least the docklands revival of the 1980s, which itself had foreign help. Areas that used to serve as bywords for dilapidation - King's Cross, Battersea power station, Elephant and Castle - are the subjects of lavish regeneration. The colossal Tate Modern, the world's most-visited modern art gallery, is getting even bigger to meet demand. Taking shape underground is Crossrail, the biggest construction project in Europe. This great fury of building - London is now a city of cranes and giant drilling machines - would not happen in a city that turned away from globalisation.\par \par \uc2 Critics say London is an unequal city as though Paris, Moscow and New York are not. They lament the price of property as though Hong Kong and Tokyo are famous for their affordable town houses. London suffers all the pathologies of a city of its size and importance.\par \par \uc2 There was a time when London really was depopulating year on year, when infrastructure decayed, when whole parts of town were left to fester without even a plan for revival. These were the decades before the 1980s, a period romanticised by those down on the London of Abramovich. It is now a city of ever more people, of endless construction, of falling crime and improving schools - a magnet to Europe's young.\par \par \uc2 Londoners appreciate the anguish shown on their behalf by the foreign media. But, really, we are coping.\par \par \uc2 janan.ganesh@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @JananGanesh\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020140310ea3a0035z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw88\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1320\pichgoal600

Many post-war \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  lacked qualifications or had qualifications that were not directly transferable to employers in Britain.\par \par \uc2 "Over the last twenty years educational attainment has been increasing among ethnic groups as a result of an improvement in access to education overseas and the increasing proportion of ethnic minority people educated in Britain."\par \par \uc2 The study also found differences in achievement between younger and older people, and these were more marked for ethnic minorities.\par \par \uc2 The proportion of Asian people aged 25 to 49 with no qualifications was almost double the number of 16 to 24-year-olds from an Asian background (15% compared to 8%).\par \par \uc2 But for the same two age groups, the proportion of white British people with no qualifications was identical at 11%.\par \par \uc2 Study author Kitty Lymperopoulou said: "Over the last twenty years, educational attainment has been increasing among ethnic groups as a result of an improvement in access to education overseas and the increasing proportion of ethnic minority people educated in Britain.\par \par \uc2 "Though this is good news for ethnic minorities, we need to remember that despite achievement gaps between some ethnic groups and white British people narrowing or even disappearing, ethnic minority groups continue to experience inequalities in education and the labour market."\par \par \uc2 Document NSONL00020140310ea3a002jv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Adults from ethnic minority backgrounds are more likely to be educated to a high standard than their white British peers, according to research.\par \par \uc2 Figures show they are significantly more likely to hold a degree and less likely to have no qualifications at all than their white counterparts.\par \par \uc2 People from the best-qualified group \u8211\'20\'13 Chinese \u8211\'20\'13 were around 75 per cent more likely to be university educated than those identified as white British.\par \par \uc2 The study by \uc2 Manchester University\uc2  also found that many ethnic minorities had seen bigger overall improvements in education standards over the last 20 years.\par \par \uc2 Researchers suggested that the improvements were due to highly-skilled migrants entering the UK combined with an increase in the number of ethnic minorities \u8211\'20\'13 particularly women \u8211\'20\'13 entering higher education.\par \par \uc2 But the study revealed that the shift has failed to translate into the workplace, with ethnic minorities more likely to be left in low-paid jobs because of \u8220\'20\'1Cinequalities in employment".\par \par \uc2 Kitty Lymperopoulou, from Manchester\u8217\'20\'19s geography department, the report\u8217\'20\'19s author, said: "Over the last 20 years, educational attainment has been increasing among ethnic groups as a result of an improvement in access to education overseas and the increasing proportion of ethnic minority people educated in Britain.\par \par \uc2 "Though this is good news for ethnic minorities, we need to remember that despite achievement gaps between some ethnic groups and white British people narrowing or even disappearing, ethnic minority groups continue to experience inequalities in education and the labour market."\par \par \uc2 The study analysed results from the 1991, 2001 and 2011 census to track changes to qualifications over the last 20 years.\par \par \uc2 Overall, 26 per cent of white British adults held a degree, compared with 40 per cent of those described as Black African, 42 per cent of Indians and 43 per cent from Chinese backgrounds.\par \par \uc2 Many other ethnic groups made larger improvements over the 20-year period than their white British counterparts.\par \par \uc2 Between 1991 and 2011, the proportion of Indian people holding a degree increased almost three-fold from 15 to 42 per cent \u8211\'20\'13 a 27 percentage point increase. For those from Pakistani backgrounds, numbers more than tripled from seven to 25 per cent \u8211\'20\'13 a rise of 18 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 By comparison, the proportion of white people holding a degree increased from 13 to 26 per cent \u8211\'20\'13 up 13 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 This increase was smaller than for every other ethnic group examined, the study said.\par \par \uc2 "People from ethnic minority groups were generally more likely than white British people to have degree level qualifications or equivalent," it said.\par \par \uc2 "In 2011, only people from the white gypsy or Irish traveller, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and white and black Caribbean groups were less likely than white British people to have degree level qualifications or equivalent."\par \par \uc2 The study found similar trends in relation to people with no qualifications.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, almost one-in-four white British people \u8211\'20\'13 24 per cent \u8211\'20\'13 had no qualifications. This was more than for other ethnic groups, including those who were Black African (11 per cent), Chinese (16 per cent), Indian (15 per cent) and Black Caribbean (20 per cent).\par \par \uc2 Both Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups had slightly more people with no qualifications \u8211\'20\'13 26 and 28 per cent respectively \u8211\'20\'13 but these numbers had dropped considerably between 2001 and 2011.\par \par \uc2 The researchers concluded: "Historically, ethnic minority groups have been disadvantaged in terms of education compared with the white British group. Many post-war \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  lacked qualifications or had qualifications that were not directly transferable to employers in Britain.\par \par \uc2 "Over the last 20 years educational attainment has been increasing among ethnic groups as a result of an improvement in access to education overseas and the increasing proportion of ethnic minority people educated in Britain."\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140310ea3a003h8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw505\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7575\pichgoal600

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Downing Street has been forced to check how a foreign-born nanny employed by David and Samantha Cameron came to be a British citizen, after a back-firing speech by a Conservative MP.\par \par \uc2 James Brokenshire, the newly appointed \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, gave a speech this week which appeared to blame the \u8220\'20\'1Cwealthy metropolitan elite" for jeopardising the employment prospects of working-class Britons by employing foreign staff.\par \par \uc2 The Camerons have never made a secret of the fact that they employed a Nepalese-born nanny, Gita Lima, who has worked with them for years and moved with them into Downing Street.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s comments have exposed the Prime Minister to a charge of hypocrisy for doing exactly what his minister was railing against.\par \par \uc2 Questions were also raised whether the decision to grant British citizenship to the nanny had been influenced by the fact that the Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s family pay her wages.\par \par \uc2 Phil Wilson, a Labour whip, said: \u8220\'20\'1CThere must now be complete transparency and openness from the Prime Minister over any contact between him, his office and the Home Office regarding his family\u8217\'20\'19s nanny. There should not be any delay in providing this information, so that people can be assured that he has acted appropriately."\par \par \uc2 After some delay, Downing Street confirmed that Samantha Cameron had been named as the nanny\u8217\'20\'19s employer on her application form. But it said neither of the couple had written a letter to support her application.\par \par \uc2 Nine years ago the Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett resigned after it was revealed that a fax sent from his office had apparently helped fast-track an application to renew a work permit by a Filipina nanny employed by a woman the minister had had an affair with. A subsequent investigation by the former civil servant, Sir Alan Budd, found no evidence that Mr Blunkett had authorised or even known about the fax.\par \par \uc2 Downing Street has denied any parallel between the two cases. Mr Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s comments, in a speech on Thursday, could cause problems for other ministers, after the Labour MP John Mann demanded that every Cabinet minister should say \u8220\'20\'1Cwhat staff they have employed from abroad".\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, was asked on his weekly LBC radio phone-in show whether he employs any foreign staff. His initial reaction was to refuse to answer, but later he said that one of his staff is Belgian.\par \par \uc2 Mr Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s predecessor as \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  minister, Mark Harper, resigned after he discovered that he had been employing an illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  to clean his London flat.\par \par \uc2 In his first speech since his appointment, Mr Brokenshire told a meeting organised by the think-tank, Demos: \u8220\'20\'1CFor too long, the benefits of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour; or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services \u8211\'20\'13 but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country."\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140310ea3a004h5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Ordinary workers, whose wages had stagnated, had lost out.\par \par \uc2 The comments led to questions being raised about Cabinet members\u8217\'20\'19 use of foreign domestic help, including Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  in his Downing Street flat, much to the frustration of his advisers.\par \par \uc2 Keith Vaz\uc2 , the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, asked Mrs May in the House of Commons on Monday if she would return Mr Brokenshire to his \u8220\'20\'1Cnormal sensible demeanour" to ensure a \u8220\'20\'1Cconstructive debate on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ".\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8220\'20\'1CLast Thursday, [Mr Brokenshire] scolded the metropolitan elite, which of course included members of the Cabinet for employing people who were born outside this country.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere are 4.4 million people who are born outside this country who are contributing to our economy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat (Mr Brokenshire) said came dangerously close to endorsing the discredited slogan of \u8216\'20\'18British jobs for British workers\u8217\'20\'19."\par \par \uc2 Mrs May replied: \u8220\'20\'1CA constructive debate on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was exactly what [Mr Brokenshire] was contributing to.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAnd I do not accept the description of the speech that [Mr Brokenshire] has given. As I have just said... what he was pointing out is that uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has the greatest impact on those at the lower end of the income scale.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI would have thought as a Labour MP, you should care about that."\par \par \uc2 Earlier Mrs May also told Laurence Robertson, a Tory backbencher: \u8220\'20\'1CUncontrolled gross \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  of course does put pressure on our public services and infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAnd as [Mr Brokenshire] has pointed out, the people who most suffer from the impact of uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  are those at the lower end of the income scale."\par \par \uc2 Separately a former Tory Coalition minister said British workers had been replaced by migrants in food and farming jobs because they are not prepared to do the work.\par \par \uc2 Sir Jim Paice, an environment minister until 2012, said plenty of agricultural employers paid their workers well and housed them in good accommodation.\par \par \uc2 But he said the only reason there was job displacement in the sector was because \u8220\'20\'1CBritish workers are just not prepared to do that work".\par \par \uc2 Mrs May said the UK does \u8220\'20\'1Cneed to look at ensuring that people here in the United Kingdom are able to take on the jobs that are available to them and at the moment [we] have no intention of reintroducing the seasonal agricultural workers scheme".\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140310ea3a00466\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 May blasts Government critics on \uc2 immigration\uc2 ; THE HOME Secretary has blasted Government critics and insisted the poorest in the country are the biggest victims of rising \uc2 immigration\uc2 .\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVE HAWKES, Deputy Political Editor   \par \uc2 276 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par 19:09\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd.

Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  minister James Brokenshire is not a man racked by self-doubt. But even he might have preferred not to find himself on the Commons front bench so near David Cameron only days after embroiling the PM, his wife, and who yet knows how many of his colleagues in \u8220\'20\'1Cnannygate".\par \par \uc2 In an ill-starred debut speech last week, Brokenshire tried to seize the Ukip low ground by suggesting that the main beneficiaries of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  were a \u8220\'20\'1Cwealthy metropolitan elite" who wanted \u8220\'20\'1Ccheap tradesmen and services". Apart from being ungallant about his predecessor Mark Harper, whose resignation over the discovery that his cleaner was working illegally in the UK was the only reason Brokenshire got the job in the first place, this invited unwelcome attention on the Camerons\u8217\'20\'19 Nepalese nanny and the Cleggs\u8217\'20\'19 \u8220\'20\'1Clady with a Belgian passport who helps us".\par \par \uc2 His immediate boss Theresa May offered a spirited defence on Monday of the born again anti-elitist Brokenshire whose safe Tory seat of Old Bexley and Sidcup hasn\u8217\'20\'19t up to now been seen as a proletarian stronghold.\par \par \uc2 Labour\u8217\'20\'19s Keith Vaz had pointed out that \u8220\'20\'1Cthere are 4.4 million people who are born outside this country who are contributing to our economy," and added that Brokenshire had come \u8220\'20\'1Cdangerously close" to endorsing the \u8220\'20\'1Cdiscredited" slogan (which Vaz neglected to say was Gordon Brown\u8217\'20\'19s) of \u8220\'20\'1CBritish jobs for British\u160\'00\'A0 workers".\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNo," replied Ms May, undeterred by her own employment of a Brazilian cleaner, her new recruit had been on the button \u8220\'20\'1Cby pointing out that uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  has the greatest impact on those at the lower end of the income scale".\par \par \uc2 This did not stop some unstatesmanlike finger pointing by an amused Ed Miliband and his shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander at a Tory front bench which briefly included Mr Cameron, Ms May, and their clumsy nemesis, as the leaders prepared for the unfortunately timed Prime Ministerial statement on Ukraine which followed Home Office questions.\par \par \uc2 But it was the South East Cambs farming Tory Sir James Paice who really challenged Home Office hawkishness on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , pointing to \u8220\'20\'1Ccountless employers in the food and farming sector who do not use illegal gangmasters [but] pay good pay... and where there is job displacement it is because British workers are not prepared to do that work".\par \par \uc2 When Cambridgeshire speaks, Brokenshire should worry.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140311ea3a000rv\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Top judge who was soft on foreign criminals has been sacked after it emerged he was living with an illegal \uc2 immigrant\b0\par\par\uc2 HARRIET ARKELL   \par \uc2 723 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2014\par 10:51\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 John Crace's sketch Pull out Putin, or we'll talk loudly\b0\par\par\uc2 543 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 March 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The greater the impotence, the louder the rhetoric from Westminster. Since the prime minister informed the Commons last week that Russia had been a very, very naughty boy and Britain would leave nothing off the table in its efforts to bring \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  into line, Russia has organised a referendum in Crimea and prevented representatives of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe from entering the area. Deterrence in action.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, David Cameron updated MPs on the EU response to the Ukraine situation. The EU, he said, would not turn "a blind eye". Rather it was going to let Russia do pretty much what it wants with both eyes open and if Putin wanted to annex the Isle of Wight into the bargain, then it would give the matter serious consideration. At least that's what he might as well have said.\par \par \uc2 The PM began by telling everyone he had been at the centre of world events at the weekend. Without him, the Poles and French would not have had an idea there was a crisis in the Ukraine and the entire EU response had been co-ordinated by him and, to a degree, Angela Merkel. He also reminded MPs of his vitally important call to Barack Obama. He didn't comment on the disappointing response to his \uc2 Facebook\uc2  selfie. Though possibly Putin liked it.\par \par \uc2 So what was the clear message from the EU? "We have agreed a three-phase approach to stand up to this aggression", he said. First phase: do nothing much. Second: do a little bit more than nothing much. Third: talk more loudly about doing a little bit more than nothing much. Mr Cameron seems certain that restricting oligarchs' shopping in Bond Street will bring the Russians to their senses. Call it Prada diplomacy.\par \par \uc2 Cameron did hint at a solution, though, in answer to a question from Sir Peter Tapsell about the Crimea referendum. Were it to be done legally, he said, "the people of Ukraine and Crimea can express their preferences". So there we have it. Putin delays the referendum until it's done properly, Russia gets to hang on to Crimea and everyone is happy. Apart from a few Ukrainians.\par \par \uc2 If there is a referendum, one person who will almost certainly be a UK observer is Tory James Brokenshire, the new \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  minister. He might have broken the record for the shortest term in office, having used his maiden speech last week to send both parties' front benches racing to check the visa status and pay of their domestic staff, had it not been more embarrassing to sack him than keep him.\par \par \uc2 At Home Office questions earlier in the day, he looked like a needy, junior prefect, constantly looking to head girl Theresa May for approval. She finally rewarded him with a thin, wintery smile near the end for which he looked pathetically grateful.\par \par \uc2 Brokenshire used his time at the dispatch box to be Brokenrecord, desperate to stay on message by repeating time and again that Britain only wanted "the brightest and the best" \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . Just as well Brokenrecord is British, because he's neither the brightest nor the best.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140310ea3b0006o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Humphrys: pro-Europe BBC shied away from \uc2 immigration\uc2  debate: Programmes 'weren't sufficiently sceptical' More managers need to be sacked, says presenter\b0\par\par\uc2 Josh Halliday   \par \uc2 705 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 March 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The BBC was not "sufficiently sceptical" in its coverage of the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate because it had "bought into the European ideal," according to its best-known radio interviewer.\par \par \uc2 John Humphrys said that the BBC had previously overlooked the potential negatives of unchecked \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , but had since redressed the imbalance in its coverage.\par \par \uc2 "We weren't sufficiently sceptical - that's the most accurate phrase - of the pro-European case. We bought into the European ideal," the Today programme interviewer told the Radio Times.\par \par \uc2 "We didn't look at the potential negatives with sufficient rigour . . . I think we're out of that now. I think we have changed."\par \par \uc2 In an interview likely to reignite allegations of a leftwing bias at the BBC, the veteran broadcaster also said the corporation had been "grotesquely over-managed" and recruited people with "broadly liberal views".\par \par \uc2 He told the magazine that "the BBC has tended over the years to be broadly liberal as opposed to broadly conservative for all sorts of perfectly understandable reasons. The sort of people we've recruited - the best and the brightest - tended to come from universities and backgrounds where they're more likely to hold broadly liberal views than conservative."\par \par \uc2 The observation is likely to be leapt upon by politicians and rightwing sections of the media hostile to the public broadcaster. But Humphrys is the latest in a series of senior BBC figures publicly to question the corporation's commitment to impartiality on controversial topics including Europe and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said in January that the broadcaster had made a "terrible mistake" by shying away from a proper debate on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In publicity interviews for his BBC programme The Truth About \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2 , Robinson said BBC news executives "feared having a conversation about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , feared the consequence", worried that a full debate might "unleash some terrible side of the British public".\par \par \uc2 In a wide-ranging interview with the Radio Times, Humphrys said that he had voted for "most political parties" and accused BBC management of leaving the Today programme "as pared down as it's possible to get". "There are too many of them," said Humphrys, 70, of BBC managers. "I think they think that. I think \uc2 Tony Hall\uc2  [the director general] thinks that - I don't know, I haven't asked him, but I think he thinks that. Over the years we've been grotesquely over-managed, there's no question. They're now getting a grip on it. A lot have gone. I think more need to go."\par \par \uc2 Humphrys said senior BBC figures were sympathetic to his calls for more resources at Today, which he described as the broadcaster's most important programme. "But the problem was that when the previous regime was faced with having to cut its budget under huge pressure, and reasonably so because of the way we saw money was being chucked around - in some cases irresponsibly, big payoffs to people who shouldn't have had them - you look at your own programme and you think, 'Bloody hell, we could have done with that'."\par \par \uc2 Humphrys, who has presented Today since 1987, welcomed the recent arrival of \uc2 Mishal Husain\uc2  as Today's second female presenter in a lineup that also includes \uc2 Sarah Montague\uc2 , Justin Webb, Evan Davis and James Naughtie.\par \par \uc2 "It's terribly simple. Obviously, not all men are the same as all women but they should have equal opportunities and the idea that you say, 'Well, we've now got two [female presenters], that's enough,' is daft," he said.\par \par \uc2 Humphrys brushed aside any suggestion of tension with Husain, whom he introduced on BBC2's Celebrity Mastermind as a "newsreader and very good-looking woman" before asking whether she did her job only because she was attractive. "I was making the point that it helps in the newsreading business - and this isn't controversial, you only have to switch on the telly - to be young and beautiful and highly trained. She's a proper journalist," he added.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Humphrys criticised big BBC payoffs\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140310ea3b00095\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 On the trail of an elusive set of MEPs: Ukip in Europe: EU data shows members taking full advantage of parliamentary allowances while avoiding attending sessions\b0\par\par\uc2 Rajeev Syal   \par \uc2 1,172 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 March 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Trying to find Ukip's MEPs in the corridors of European power in Brussels or Strasbourg can be a frustrating task, according to former party staff members, because they are allowed to wander at will. But woe betide those who go missing when it is time to donate cash.\par \par \uc2 As party leader Nigel Farage prepares for what is expected to be a successful European parliament election on 22 May - which may provide impetus for the general election - those who have worked for the party claim the MEPs can do as they please, most of the time.\par \par \uc2 Some rarely carry a mobile phone while others do not turn their phones on; and one or two, it is alleged, have become involved in "extracurricular work" - managing private businesses - at times when they could have been working for constituents.\par \par \uc2 "They come and go when they like. For weeks, you may not see one and then they are all there - invariably at a bar occupied by other elderly British men," said one former Ukip employee. "Their primary reason for coming in is to claim money."\par \par \uc2 But if MEPs fail to donate to the party - the Guardian disclosed yesterday that in 2011 the party insisted they give pounds 10,000 each or risk being deselected - they can be put under acute pressure to leave the group, MEPs said.\par \par \uc2 Nikki Sinclaire, the West Midlands MEP who left Ukip in 2010, said: "The only discipline the party's MEPs come under is that they must sign up to Ukip and the party's grouping, the Europe of Freedom and Democracy [EFD]. Generally they don't turn up."\par \par \uc2 Sinclaire said she had left the party after refusing to sign up to the EFD because some of the grouping's members held homophobic and racist views. She said she had been forced out because the party needed her signature to gain access to EU money. "Nigel and others do expect loyalty when it comes to the party's finances. That is how they fund the party and how they are funding May's election," she said.\par \par \uc2 According to official figures from the EU and \uc2 Britain's Electoral Commission\uc2 , Ukip MEPs have continued to excel in the claiming of EU expenses and generous donations to their party in the UK.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, the party's MEPs claimed pounds 370,000 for office costs and received nearly pounds 420,000 in subsistence allowances for meals and hotels. In the same period, they donated more than pounds 400,000 of their own money to the party.\par \par \uc2 All MEPs receive a salary of pounds 78,000 but must appear at a parliamentary building in order to receive various allowances.\par \par \uc2 Ukip MEPs claimed an average of pounds 35,635 each in "general expenditure allowances" in 2012, which should cover "office management costs". The allowances are in addition to salaries, travel expenses and "daily subsistence allowance". Ukip did not return calls seeking comment for this article, but said last week: "All our MEPs conduct their financial affairs honestly and comply with the rules covering allowances and expenses."\par \par \uc2 Paul Nuttall, the party's North West MEP, has donated pounds 12,400 to Ukip since 2009, according to the Electoral Commission. His allowances claim last year was pounds 40,436. He was among MEPs who have given Ukip donations of pounds 426,000 since the 2009 election.\par \par \uc2 Godfrey Bloom, the outspoken MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, has claimed pounds 46,722 in allowances and paid pounds 72,000 in donations since 2004. He left the EFD after saying British aid went to "bongo bongo land" but is understood to have remained close to Farage.\par \par \uc2 Derek Clark, MEP for East Midlands, claimed pounds 56,822 general and subsistence allowances and has donated pounds 187,000 to the party since 2004. Clark was asked to repay pounds 31,800 of EU allowances two years ago after it was found that the money was paying salaries for party staff.\par \par \uc2 Stuart Agnew, representative for East of England, has claimed more than pounds 78,000 in allowances and made at least pounds 31,000 in donations since 2009; Mike Nattrass, who resigned the party whip in September, has received pounds 59,845 in allowances and donated pounds 96,000 since 2004.\par \par \uc2 Senior Ukip figures have defended the party's position on expenses, and say they are relaxed about diverting money to the party in Britain.\par \par \uc2 Last month, Trevor Colman, a Ukip MEP for the South West, told the BBC that allowances were a factor influencing his motivations for appearing at the EU parliament. "I wouldn't say getting the allowances is one of the main motivations, I'm trying to be fair about it, it is a factor, of course it is," Colman said.\par \par \uc2 He defended his decision not to concentrate on making speeches, saying he was instead concentrating on an anti-EU website. "Why make a speech when you know that it is totally ineffective?" he told the BBC. Colman, who is standing down in May, employs five full-time staff who mainly work on the website, plus another to cover Strasbourg and Brussels. He echoed the sentiments of other senior Ukip activists when he said European democracy is a farce and he uses its funds to try to shed light on its failings.\par \par \uc2 Ukip officials say they are coming under intense media scrutiny because of the political implications of their rise. Last week, polls showed the party attracting 14% of the vote, which could rise considerably at May's elections.\par \par \uc2 The Tories are expected to face the greatest damage. \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , who once branded the party's supporters "fruitcakes, nutters and closet racists", has since called for them to return to the Conservatives if they wish to curb \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and see a referendum on EU membership.\par \par \uc2 Robert Halfon, the influential Tory backbench MP, last week compared the views of Gerard Batten, the Ukip MEP for London - who believes Muslims should sign a special code of conduct - to those of the Nazis, who insisted Jews should wear a yellow star.\par \par \uc2 Halfon, who is Jewish, said: "I genuinely find it abhorrent and frightening. I'm amazed that the man is still an MEP."\par \par \uc2 One party official said the Tories - as well as the media - were panicking in the face of a new political force and brushed off allegations of a misuse of EU funds. "We are taking the Devil's money to do God's work. And the more we are scrutinised and attacked, the stronger we seem to be with the electorate."\par \par \uc2 Ukip's share of the vote according to a poll last week. The party may well do much better than that in May's elections\par \par \uc2 14%\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage listening to the president of the European parliament, Martin Schulz, in Strasbourg in 2012 Photograph: Georges Gobet/AFP/Getty Images\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140310ea3b00098\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Anti-racism MP poses for pic with son blacked up like Jacko, you know it\u8217\'20\'19s bad, bad...really, really BAD; exclusive .

\par\par \uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 Fruitcake test fails to weed out all the Walter Mittys and assorted eccentrics\b0\par\par\uc2 Rachel Sylvester and Alice Thomson   \par \uc2 1,045 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 March 2014\par 00:01\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The company that ran a \u8220\'20\'1Cfruitcake test" for Ukip has said that its psychometric assessment is not an appropriate tool for selecting political candidates.\par \par \uc2 The Times has obtained details of the questions that were put to people applying to be MEPs to try to \u8220\'20\'1Cweed out the Walter Mittys", as Nigel Farage has put it. Designed to assess emotional intelligence, candidates were asked to rate themselves on a scale of one to five on statements such as: \u8220\'20\'1CI generally hope for the best"; \u8220\'20\'1CI find it difficult to describe my feelings"; and \u8220\'20\'1CI would describe myself as a calm person."\par \par \uc2 Martin Reed, chief executive of Thomas International, said that the company had no idea that the test it designed would be used to choose parliamentary candidates. \u8220\'20\'1CIt would generally be used as a coaching and development tool," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s not a black and white process."\par \par \uc2 One councillor who applied to be an MEP was rejected on the basis of the test, which was used as part of a wider assessment process by the party. However, he later discovered that he had scored 99 per cent overall, with high marks for empathy, well-being, independence and optimism. He believes that he was a victim of a \u8220\'20\'1Cstitch-up" by Mr Farage.\par \par \uc2 A friend in the party told him that he was clearly \u8220\'20\'1Ctoo sane to be a Ukip MEP".\par \par \uc2 A Ukip spokesman defended its assessment process, insisted that the party leader was not involved and said that in this instance it was \u8220\'20\'1Crigorous and fair".\par \par \uc2 The party has tried to make light of its reputation for attracting extremists and eccentrics. At its spring conference in Torquay, fruitcake was offered at the door. People applying to be parliamentary candidates are now asked to promise that they do not have any \u8220\'20\'1Cskeletons in the cupboard" that may cause them or Ukip embarrassment \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1Cif you would like to declare something, continue on another sheet if necessary", the application form says.\par \par \uc2 There is still scope for embarrassment, though. The bestselling children\u8217\'20\'19s writer G. P. Taylor \u8212\'20\'14 author of the Shadowmancer series \u8212\'20\'14 joined Ukip, giving money and standing as a councillor, but left last year because he felt uncomfortable with the members. \u8220\'20\'1CI met quite a few and I decided they weren\u8217\'20\'19t the type of people I wanted to be around," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThere was one guy who looked like a character in \u8217\'20\'19Allo \u8217\'20\'19Allo!, with a trilby and a leather coat.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere were some very odd people in the Ukip fold \u8212\'20\'14 a couple of conspiracy theorists, others who were saying things which I felt were verging on racist and misogynistic. I decided I didn\u8217\'20\'19t want to be involved."\par \par \uc2 Last week Donna Edmunds, a Ukip councillor who is standing for the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , was criticised after claiming that businesses should be allowed to refuse service to women, gay or black people. There was controversy over the party\u8217\'20\'19s former Commonwealth spokesman, who had been jailed for his role in a kidnapping gang in Pakistan. A prospective MEP, Shneur Odze, refused to shake women\u8217\'20\'19s hands, claiming that his Orthodox Judaism forbade contact with women other than his wife.\par \par \uc2 Pearlette Hopkins, who is standing as a councillor in Bristol, arrived from Jamaica in 2001 and is now a UK resident but has yet to become a citizen. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s so expensive to become one," she says.\par \par \uc2 She resents the fact she cannot bring her two children and three grandchildren to this country. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s impossible for them to come over here now. There are too many other \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and they wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be able to work or get benefits unlike the Eastern Europeans. It\u8217\'20\'19s unfair for Britain to turn its back on the Commonwealth like this," she says. \u8220\'20\'1CI love Britain but the schools are shocking and they speak so many languages here now, you barely realise you are in Britain any more."\par \par \uc2 David Silvester, the Ukip councillor from Henley who was suspended from the party after claiming that the floods were a punishment from God, has been asked to reapply for membership. \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t regret what I said at all," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CI believe God is behind all the weather, the Old Testament makes that absolutely clear. I\u8217\'20\'19ve had letters and e-mails of support from several hundred people and quite large numbers of them are Ukip members."\par \par \uc2 He thinks other punishments may be meted out from on high: \u8220\'20\'1CThis nation has got a lot to answer for \u8212\'20\'14 abortion, for example. Since 1967, we have killed more foetuses than Jews were killed by the Nazis."\par \par \uc2 As it expands to fill the \u8220\'20\'1Cprotest party" vacuum left by the Lib Dems, Ukip seems happy to welcome individuals shunned by other parties. One activist at the spring conference, who would not give his name, said: \u8220\'20\'1CI was a teacher and I was sacked for swearing and touching a child but I didn\u8217\'20\'19t do it. Ukip are the only ones who have supported me. They recognise that this PC gone mad is hounding good people out of jobs."\par \par \uc2 The party has also accepted money from donors who would set alarm bells ringing elsewhere. Demetri Marchessini, a Greek businessman who has donated at least \u163\'00\'A310,000 to Ukip, describes homosexuality as \u8220\'20\'1Cimmoral" and insists that women should never wear trousers. \u8220\'20\'1CIt says in the Bible that anyone who wears the clothes of the opposite sex is an abomination," he told us. \u8220\'20\'1CFor thousands of years it was a crime. In any case women look terrible in trousers . . . maybe Audrey Hepburn or Marlene Dietrich could wear them but most women can\u8217\'20\'19t."\par \par \uc2 He said that he had photographed many women \u8220\'20\'1Cfrom the rear" to prove his theory. \u8220\'20\'1CWomen no longer dress to please men or even just to look nice."\par \par \uc2 He said that sexual harassment allegations were also \u8220\'20\'1Cabsurd". \u8220\'20\'1CHow can you have sexual harassment if men and women are equal? If someone touches your leg, you ask them to move their hand." He also criticised working mothers, saying that they should stay at home for their children.\par \par \uc2 Then he suggested lunch, saying: \u8220\'20\'1CThe Ritz is always safe for ladies."\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140311ea3b000cm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s easy to sneer at Ukip. \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  called them \u8220\'20\'1Cfruitcakes, loonies and closet racists", \uc2 Michael Howard\uc2  dismissed them as \u8220\'20\'1Cgadflies and cranks". Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s barmy army looks like a one-man-pint-in-hand-band, combining golf club bonhomie with shock-jock prejudice \u8212\'20\'14 reactionary, swivel-eyed, out of touch.\par \par \uc2 Although the country is struggling at the edge of recession, Ukip has no economic policy and its leader has disowned his entire 2010 manifesto. Of the party\u8217\'20\'19s 21 MEPs elected since 1999, almost half have defected, resigned, been suspended or gone to jail. The Ukip headquarters has been described as \u8220\'20\'1CCarry On Politics" \u8212\'20\'14 ill-disciplined and unprofessional. Even the leader\u8217\'20\'19s wife, Kirsten, has described the party\u8217\'20\'19s operation as a \u8220\'20\'1Cfreak show". These rebels with a cause seem to revel in their eccentricity: at Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s recent spring conference in Torquay there was fruit cake on offer to delegates at the door.\par \par \uc2 And this is not just harmless fun, a Monster Raving Loony Party in pinstripes. There is bigotry behind the comments blaming the floods on gay marriage and suggesting that women are sluts if they do not clean behind the fridge. There is cynicism and hypocrisy lurking below the surface, with MEPs happily riding first class on the Brussels gravy train even as they express their disgust at the House of Commons expenses scandal. They stay in smart Strasbourg hotels and dine in fine restaurants, slurping Chteau Margaux at taxpayers\u8217\'20\'19 expense, while condemning the waste of money by the EU. The party is also facing a \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  investigation into allegations that it improperly diverted public money to pay its staff in London. With a higher profile comes greater scrutiny and there is a bad smell around the Kippers.\par \par \uc2 I have spent the past two months investigating Ukip with Alice Thomson and it is clear that these anti-Establishment insurgents are guilty of appalling double standards. There is also a clear streak of nastiness running through the party. And yet, I can\u8217\'20\'19t help feeling that it would be foolish and dangerous for the mainstream parties to ignore the Faragistes. It\u8217\'20\'19s not just that the insurgents could steal their votes at the European elections in May, almost certainly forcing the Tories into third place and possibly beating Labour to the top spot. Nor is the issue that Ukip is expanding its base in local government, raising the prospect that it could soon be involved in council coalitions, wielding actual power.\par \par \uc2 What really matters is that the rise of Ukip exposes deep social and economic divisions in Britain. It points to a profound sense of alienation among certain sections of the population. Mr Farage may be a flawed character, more knave than fool in my view, but he is like the canary in the mine who is picking up on the poison gas of class and wealth inequality. His party is full of idiots, but its success is a serious warning to the political establishment and the \u8220\'20\'1Cmetropolitan elite" that includes the media.\par \par \uc2 Russell Brand touched a nerve when he declared himself \u8220\'20\'1Cutterly disenchanted by politics", condemning politicians as \u8220\'20\'1Cfrauds and liars" and the political system \u8220\'20\'1Cnothing more than a bureaucratic means for furthering the augmentation and advantages of economic elites". Now Ukip is tapping into this mood \u8212\'20\'14 Neil Hamilton, the party\u8217\'20\'19s deputy chairman, claims that 40 per cent of the party\u8217\'20\'19s supporters did not vote at the last election. Ukip is not, however, just the \u8220\'20\'1Cnone of the above" protest party, it is also playing on the economic disadvantage and educational exclusion felt by a minority of the electorate as the country returns to growth.\par \par \uc2 It is striking \u8212\'20\'14 but no coincidence \u8212\'20\'14 that, according to YouGov polling for The Times, Ukip is the most working-class party, with 52 per cent of its supporters coming from the C2DE social groups, compared with 46 per cent for Labour, 43 per cent for the Tories and 32 per cent for the Lib Dems. Its voters are also the least well educated of any party apart from the BNP \u8212\'20\'14 52 per cent of Ukip backers left school at 16 or earlier.\par \par \uc2 As you might expect, these voters are Eurosceptic, hostile to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and culturally conservative; they are more likely than others to oppose gay marriage and to think mothers of young children should stay at home. What is more surprising, though, is that they are to the left on economics. In our poll, 57 per cent of Ukip supporters favoured increasing the top rate of tax to \u8220\'20\'1Cat least 50 per cent". Meanwhile, 72 per cent opposed the HS2 rail link, a position that would put them closer to Ed Balls than George Osborne. The over-riding sentiment among Ukip voters is pessimism \u8212\'20\'14 on the economy and prospects for their own family. Eighty per cent think it will be difficult for today\u8217\'20\'19s young adults to prosper over the next twenty years and 56 per cent believe Britain\u8217\'20\'19s best years are behind it.\par \par \uc2 In their new book Revolt on the Right, the academics Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford track the demographic changes that have created such fertile conditions for Ukip. Although in 1964 working-class voters outnumbered middle-class ones by 2 to 1, by 2010, the middle classes had a 4 to 3 advantage. When \uc2 Harold Wilson\uc2  won power, almost half of workers were in blue-collar jobs and more than 70 per cent of voters had no formal educational qualifications; by the time Tony Blair became Prime Minister 33 years later, a third of the electorate was in professional middle-class jobs and one in five had university degrees, a trend that has continued.\par \par \uc2 In the past 50 years, in other words, Britain has changed from a country where blue-collar workers determined elections to one where the aspirational middle classes decide the outcome. As \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg \u8212\'20\'14 all well-educated, wealthy metropolitan liberals \u8212\'20\'14 focus on wooing Middle England, Ukip is appealing to the \u8220\'20\'1Cleft behind" working-class voters who feel ignored by the political elite.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CUkip\u8217\'20\'19s emergence is not primarily the result of things the mainstream parties or their leaders have said or done," Goodwin and Ford write. \u8220\'20\'1CThis revolt is the result of their inability to articulate and respond to deep-seated and longstanding social and political conflicts in Britain." It is the same desire for a voice that led to the blip in support for the BNP a few years ago.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage is completely wrong in his analysis of the problems the country faces and the solutions he proposes. His party is cynically exploiting vulnerable people and playing on their worst instincts and fears. But the rise in Ukip reveals a deeper truth that cannot be laughed off or ignored. Britain is still two nations.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140311ea3b000cy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 It is, almost, official: the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are part of the \u8220\'20\'1Cwealthy metropolitan elite".\par \par \uc2 Days after half the Cabinet was forced to come clean about its foreign cleaners and nannies, the Duke and Duchess are reported to have hired a Spanish nanny.\par \par \uc2 In a break with the Royal Family\u8217\'20\'19s tradition of recruiting only nannies who are solidly British and, preferably, middle-aged, the couple are said to have taken on a woman in her mid-30s.\par \par \uc2 As, wisely, the couple have yet to express any opinion about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy, their decision is unlikely to leave them open to charges of hypocrisy.\par \par \uc2 Due to its timing, however, right in the middle of a coalition spat over migration, their choice will now be subjected to the same scrutiny as \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Nepalese nanny or Danny Alexander\u8217\'20\'19s Portuguese cleaner.\par \par \uc2 According to Hello! magazine the woman, their first full-time nanny, was hired before the Duke and Duchess went to the Maldives on holiday.\par \par \uc2 Until now the couple have relied for childcare help on Carole Middleton or William\u8217\'20\'19s former nanny, Jessie Webb.\par \par \uc2 The magazine says the new nanny has spent 20 years living, studying and working in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Friends of the woman, who was photographed last week taking George for a walk in Kensington Gardens, told the magazine that she lives for her job.\par \par \uc2 Kensington Palace refused to comment on the report. It is believed that the Palace will release details about her before the couple embark on their tour of New Zealand and Australia next month. The nanny will accompany the couple on the trip to look after seven-month-old George.\par \par \uc2 Westminster attention focused on migration last week after James Brokenshire, the Tory \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister, said that a \u8220\'20\'1Cwealthy, metropolitan elite" of middle-class households had helped to support mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  by demanding cheap labour and services.\par \par \uc2 Theresa May has acknowledged that rising numbers of EU residents living in Britain made it \u8220\'20\'1Cmore difficult" for \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  to fulfil his promise to reduce net migration to below 100,000 by next year. The Home Secretary faced questions over Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s pledge after figures showing that the total for this year is on course to be 212,000.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140311ea3b000do\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  to Britain are better qualified than the existing population \u8212\'20\'14 and many of those who settled here generations ago are considerably outperforming their white neighbours in education, according to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ethnicity.ac.uk/census/CoDE-Education-Census-Briefing.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 a new study}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It found that more than a third of people who were born outside the United Kingdom but are now living here have degrees, compared with just one in four of those born and bred in Britain.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the figures show members of some ethnic minorities are more likely to have a degree and less likely to have no qualifications than their white counterparts.\par \par \uc2 Chinese, Black African and Indian communities all have a higher proportion of graduates than all other ethnic groups, including white Britons.\par \par \uc2 The findings, in research conducted by \uc2 Manchester University\uc2 , are based on the 2011 census.\par \par \uc2 Researchers also found that many ethnic minorities have seen bigger overall improvements in education standards over the last 20 years.\par \par \uc2 The study also challenges the concept that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to the UK has imported poverty.\par \par \uc2 Even the ethnic groups considered the most disadvantaged are rapidly catching up on white Britons, the study says. In Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities, 28 and 29 per cent respectively have no qualifications at all.\par \par \uc2 That compares with 24 per cent of white Britons.\par \par \uc2 However, in the course of ten years up to 2011, the proportion has fallen by 19 per cent among Bangladeshi and by 16 per cent among Pakistani people, compared with a more modest fall of five per cent among white Britons.\par \par \uc2 Black Africans have the lowest proportion of unqualified people at just 11 per cent.\par \par \uc2 The data comes as politicians are involved in a bitter dispute over the economic contribution made by \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , and the cost to the existing population.\par \par \uc2 The Government has been accused of burying a report that suggests there is little cost to the economy because the Conservatives are eager to appear tough on the issue of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Kitty Lymperopoulou, co-author of the report produced by the university\u8217\'20\'19s Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity, said the findings suggested that considerable progress was being made in access to education.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COver the last 20 years, educational attainment has been increasing among ethnic groups as a result of an improvement in access to education overseas and the increasing proportion of ethnic minority people educated in Britain," she said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThough this is good news for ethnic minorities, we need to remember that despite achievement gaps between some ethnic groups and white British people narrowing or even disappearing, ethnic minority groups continue to experience inequalities in education and the labour market."\par \par \uc2 Ms Lymperopoulou said that the weaker performance from the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities was due to cultural as well as economic reasons.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis partly reflects the lower rates of participation in education among Pakistani and Bangladeshi women, but also other factors including poverty and discrimination," she said.\par \par \uc2 The study highlighted that some ethnic groups continue to lag behind with no signs of progress.\par \par \uc2 Almost two thirds of white gypsy/Irish travellers have no qualifications, making them more than twice as educationally disadvantaged as white people.\par \par \uc2 However the relative poor performance of white Britons will cause further concern in government.\par \par \uc2 Research from the London School of Economics recently found that white children came out consistently worst in a performance measure that tracks the progress made by children between primary school and taking their GCSEs.\par \par \uc2 At 16, the proportion of white British pupils awarded five or more GCSEs with a C grade or above, including English and maths, was lower than that for pupils from a long list of other nationalities including Chinese, Sri Lankan, Nigerian, Vietnamese, Indian, Ghanaian, Bangladeshi and Sierra Leonean.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140311ea3b000e0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Political Sketch\par \b \uc2 Cabinet fat cats fail to catch out the insolent mole\b0\par\par\uc2 Ann Treneman   \par \uc2 580 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 March 2014\par 00:01\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Even at the best of times James Brokenshire has the air of a panicking mole about him. His hair is quite extraordinary, a black velveteen bog-brush of such deep lustre that he must never ever go near a furrier for fear of being harvested. He looks about 17, with rimless specs that cannot hide his perpetually alarmed eyes. It is quite simply incredible that this teenager is the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister.\par \par \uc2 However, these are not the best of times for Mr Brokenshire. For last week he managed, in his debut speech, to blame the Prime Minister and others from the WME (wealthy metropolitan elite) for our \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  woes.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday he sat next to Theresa May (another of the WME), determined not to look contrite. The result was an uneasy air of insouciance that hung over his shoulders as ill-fitting as a jacket several sizes too large.\par \par \uc2 Who, I wondered, would be the first to try to catch the mole? What a delight when, from the farthest-back Labour bench, the man who is \uc2 Keith Vaz\uc2  arose. I say man, but that does not do justice to the Great Vaz, who lives for the limelight and believes that it lives for him, too.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLast Thursday the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Minister scolded the metropolitan elite, which includes, of course, members of the Cabinet," Mr Vaz announced.\par \par \uc2 Tory MPs screamed and pointed back at him. The Vaz, secretly pleased, I suspect, for who really wants to argue with any word of that description, barely paused before continuing \u8220\'20\'1Cfor employing people who were born outside this country. What he said came dangerously close to endorsing the discredited slogan of \u8216\'20\'18British jobs for British workers\u8217\'20\'19."\par \par \uc2 This caused more outrage. \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 , for it was his slogan, was nowhere to be seen, as usual. The Home Secretary, her face like a mask, observed the Great Vaz, her eyes cold, her shoes gold. Next to her the mole blinked ever faster. I looked down on him and realised that such is the density of his hair that, if turned upside down, he would make an ideal floor polisher.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CCould you ask him to return to his normal sensible demeanour?" asked Mr Vaz of the Home Secretary.\par \par \uc2 The word \u8220\'20\'1Cnormal" fell into the void from which it would never return. The mole looked slightly stunned at being described in such a bizarre way. The Vaz now called for a \u8220\'20\'1Cconstructive" debate without \u8220\'20\'1Cstereotypes and clich\u233\'00\'E9s". (This is an admirable goal but, frankly, if we stripped politics of stereotypes and clich\u233\'00\'E9s, we would all be in trouble.)\par \par \uc2 Ms May, in full Cruella mode now, announced that in fact Mr Brokenshire had been contributing to a \u8220\'20\'1Cconstructive" debate. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd I do not accept the description of the speech," she announced, as only a Home Secretary can, despite the fact that it has caused uproar and, possibly more importantly, that the Prime Minister has had to issue several statements about his nanny.\par \par \uc2 Ms May explained that Mr Brokenshire\u8217\'20\'19s message was that it is the lowest paid who suffer the most from mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . The mole nodded his head, his head burnishing the air, and later insisted that his speech had not been in the least \u8220\'20\'1Cfeeble" or \u8220\'20\'1Cpathetic". His blinking now was akin to windscreen wipers in a monsoon. But by the end of the session, we all could see that the mole had survived \u8212\'20\'14 for now.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140311ea3b000ei\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 Toad of Toad Hall or the heir to Thatcher: which is the real Nigel Farage?\b0\par\par\uc2 Alice Thomson and Rachel Sylvester   \par \uc2 2,159 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 March 2014\par 00:04\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe call it Fukip \u8212\'20\'14 Farage\u8217\'20\'19s Ukip \u8212\'20\'14 it\u8217\'20\'19s all about him," says a former aide. \u8220\'20\'1CNigel uses the party for everything he can get. He is incredibly charismatic when you first meet him. He came to visit me and strode off across the fields, extolling the virtues of the hedgerows, but after ten minutes he was out of breath. That sums him up really, he can\u8217\'20\'19t keep anything up. Under pressure he crumbles. He is very charming \u8212\'20\'14 until he\u8217\'20\'19s not."\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage is Ukip. Even the director of communications, Patrick O\u8217\'20\'19Flynn, agrees. \u8220\'20\'1CThe leader of a party is the most positive and priceless asset it has," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CIn bigger parties the leader is 60 per cent of what makes them electable. When you have a leader like Nigel Farage it means 85 per cent of our positive impact in the media is down to the efforts of one man."\par \par \uc2 And what a man. Farage polarises opinion. He has been described to us variously as \u8220\'20\'1CToad of Toad Hall", \u8220\'20\'1Ca matinee idol", \u8220\'20\'1CBart Simpson" and \u8220\'20\'1Cthe heir to Thatcher". Winston McKenzie, his Commonwealth aide, sums up the positive side: \u8220\'20\'1CWe need another Churchill in this country and Farage is the man. I love his honest approach. I stood against him as leader but now we are friends and I would trust him with my life."\par \par \uc2 A senior Tory Cabinet minister provides the opposite view: \u8220\'20\'1CHe looks like a 1950s insurance salesman. I can\u8217\'20\'19t see how anyone is taken in by him but a great many people seem to find him reassuring."\par \par \uc2 Farage was born in Herne, Kent, on April 3, 1964. His father was a conventional stockbroker and president of the local Territorial Army who left home when he was 5. His mother brought up Nigel, sending him to Dulwich College, the public school in South London, where he idolised the alumni Ernest Shackleton and P.G. Wodehouse.\par \par \uc2 It was discovering that he had testicular cancer at 19 that formed his character, according to a close friend and colleague. \u8220\'20\'1CIt returned when he was in his 20s. He knows he has cheated death, he is a survivor and that makes him feel invincible. He is convinced that there isn\u8217\'20\'19t much time."\par \par \uc2 Farage\u8217\'20\'19s first foray was into the City, following the absent father he adored. He threw himself into the drinking culture until he was hit by a car and ended up in intensive care with serious head injuries. He married the nurse who helped him back to health and by the age of 22 he was the father of two sons. But he was so busy that he spent little time at home, and the marriage ended in 1997. He then married Kirsten Mehr, a German bond-dealer who was working in the City when he met her, though she now spends her time looking after their two daughters and acting as his assistant.\par \par \uc2 It was the signing of the Maastricht treaty in 1992, he says, that forced him into politics and to join the Anti-Federalist League, which eventually became Ukip. By 2006 Farage was firmly in charge, having seen off other contenders such as Robert Kilroy-Silk, whom he named \u8220\'20\'1Cthe vain orange buffoon".\par \par \uc2 Then came his third brush with death. On the morning of the May 2010 general election, he was flying in a two-seater plane with a pro-Ukip banner attached when it crashed in a field, leaving him bleeding profusely, covered in petrol, with his breast bone and ribs broken and his lung punctured but his Ukip rosette intact.\par \par \uc2 However, he soon returned as leader and made his name with his tirades against senior members of the \uc2 European Union\uc2  such as one about \u8220\'20\'1CRumpy Pumpy" Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council, which went viral.\par \par \uc2 Farage has positioned himself as the anti-establishment candidate, being the only MEP to remain seated when the Prince of Wales was invited to speak to the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  in 2008 on climate change.\par \par \uc2 He has said: \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m not really a politician at all. That\u8217\'20\'19s the extraordinary thing. I never had any intention of being involved in this." Yet Farage joined the Conservatives at 14 and made six unsuccessful attempts to become an MP.\par \par \uc2 Although he went to a private school, wears pinstripes and sports pocket handkerchiefs, he is determinedly not posh. It\u8217\'20\'19s all about a pint in the pub, a ciggie, a game of golf and being a rebel in a blazer. \u8220\'20\'1CHe is obsessed by the posh Tory boys and likes to pretend he isn\u8217\'20\'19t anything like them, but he acts as though he is posher than anyone else. He loves black tie and fine wines and he adores smart restaurants," says a former insider. Another agrees: \u8220\'20\'1CHe\u8217\'20\'19s a real snob \u8212\'20\'14 he\u8217\'20\'19ll say, \u8216\'20\'18Oh he\u8217\'20\'19s so common\u8217\'20\'19, or \u8216\'20\'18What a terrible shirt\u8217\'20\'19."\par \par \uc2 This is partly because he likes to evoke a more old-fashioned world. For some he is deeply reassuring. Suzanne Evans, Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s new national communities and women spokeswoman, says that she defected from the Conservatives to Ukip after meeting Farage.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI was a councillor for the Tory Party and they were very patronising to women. Farage treats women exactly the same as men but he still opens the door for you \u8212\'20\'14 it\u8217\'20\'19s the best of both worlds. He is fantastic, he is honest, there\u8217\'20\'19s no flannel and he is very bright. He knows about everything. David Cameron is distant and frowning of the grass roots, Farage is a ray of sunshine."\par \par \uc2 But a former follower of the youth wing says that he is the reason why she left. \u8220\'20\'1CNigel really panders to people\u8217\'20\'19s insecurities that the world is going too fast. He acts as though he is Fred Flintstone and can drag women off into caves and stomp around waving his stick," she says. \u8220\'20\'1CHe sees himself as the saviour of the Bufton Tuftons and likes nothing better than to stride up the path of a mock Tudor house and sit down for a cup of tea to sort out the world. I trailed after him but soon felt he would be happier if I had stayed at home in my pinnie."\par \par \uc2 Farage does love the British countryside, its pubs, golf courses, cricket pavilions, sea fishing and wildlife. He was the only politician during the recent floods who owned his own pair of waders and he often waxes lyrical about England\u8217\'20\'19s green rolling hills on his tours of Ukip strongholds. He prefers the old sitcoms \u8212\'20\'14 Margot and Jerry from The Good Life, Dad\u8217\'20\'19s Army \u8212\'20\'14 and he confesses to being an \u8217\'20\'19Allo \u8217\'20\'19Allo! fan: \u8220\'20\'1CCan\u8217\'20\'19t beat it really". His favourite periods of history are the First and Second World Wars and he used to take a group of friends, \u8220\'20\'1CFarage\u8217\'20\'19s Foragers", on tours of the battlefields of France and Belgium. He wears Spitfire cufflinks and collects First World War posters.\par \par \uc2 His greatest strength is his perceived normality. Here is a man who hasn\u8217\'20\'19t always lived in the political bubble but who has had a real job and understands the real world. Neil Hamilton, the former Tory MP, who is now Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s deputy chairman, sums it up. \u8220\'20\'1CFarage is what you see \u8212\'20\'14 he is not a creature of spin. He has redeeming defects. He likes a drink and a cigarette, he likes a laugh and behaves like a normal person. When he makes mistakes, he admits them. He\u8217\'20\'19s not a dictator.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI would put him up with Thatcher as a great leader who inspires. He doesn\u8217\'20\'19t need focus groups to tell him what to think."\par \par \uc2 Yet his normality is also what can get the party into trouble. Godfrey Bloom, who has resigned the Ukip whip but is still an MEP, says: \u8220\'20\'1CI was on the piss with him only the other night. Ukip was anti-establishment,that was the great appeal to voters. But now, for better or for worse \u8212\'20\'14 and a lot of people think for worse \u8212\'20\'14 it\u8217\'20\'19s the Nigel Farage Ukip party. It\u8217\'20\'19s unfortunate. There\u8217\'20\'19s a danger whenever you have a very hard working and charismatic leader that it looks like a one-man band."\par \par \uc2 Bloom says that Farage\u8217\'20\'19s behaviour can be excessive, but the Ukip leader has always said: \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19ve never pretended to be a priest." Having shared a flat with Farage for several years in Brussels, the MEP saysP: \u8220\'20\'1CWe all have our foibles and our weaknesses \u8212\'20\'14 mine is real ale, I\u8217\'20\'19ve never been partial to crumpet \u8212\'20\'14 Nigel\u8217\'20\'19s is women. It\u8217\'20\'19s not something he ever denied."\par \par \uc2 The drinking, he thinks, is probably an asset. \u8220\'20\'1CHe loves his bottle of wine at lunch time, and in the evening, but he\u8217\'20\'19s not an alcoholic. It\u8217\'20\'19s no secret he likes a sherbet. There\u8217\'20\'19s nothing wrong with that \u8212\'20\'14 it\u8217\'20\'19s part of his charm."\par \par \uc2 Others disagree. A former staff member says: \u8220\'20\'1CUkip is hinged on Nigel\u8217\'20\'19s very complicated personal life, there is very little room to professionalise anything. There are skeletons in his closet. Nigel is dragging Highgate Cemetery behind him."\par \par \uc2 He certainly lives life to the full and sees himself as an optimist, refusing to be embarrassed or disheartened by anything. This may be partly because he has had so many near-death experiences. One former aide says: \u8220\'20\'1CHe doesn\u8217\'20\'19t like to admit he\u8217\'20\'19s in a lot of pain and is not a well man. He has cheated death three times. The drive he has is because he believes his time is very limited. There\u8217\'20\'19s a fragility to him. When the camera is off you can see his face crossed with pain."\par \par \uc2 This may be in part why both friends and foes say that he becomes easily riled. In Scotland last year, he was accused of being \u8220\'20\'1Cracist", \u8220\'20\'1Cfascist" and a \u8220\'20\'1Chomophobe" and told to go home by demonstrators.\par \par \uc2 During an interview with BBC\u8217\'20\'19s Good Morning Scotland radio show, he labelled the protesters \u8220\'20\'1Cyobbo, fascist scum" before hanging up.\par \par \uc2 He works so hard he barely has time to see his family as he relentlessly pounds the pavements and criss-crosses counties and market towns, spreading his gospel, preaching against the excesses of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . He has explained that he loves the thrill of the \u8220\'20\'1CBilly Graham moments", in which suburban doubters are spontaneously converted to the cause. He also feels guilty at how little time he manages to spend with his children. But he refuses to delegate. A former member of the Ukip governing body found it infuriating.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI feel that Nigel is the absolute dictator," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CHe keeps himself surrounded by people who are fairly weak and will bow to his forceful personality. In Ukip you are either with Nigel or you are out."\par \par \uc2 Those who cross him have to leave as Alan Sked, Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s founder, discovered. \u8220\'20\'1CEveryone thinks he\u8217\'20\'19s a nice character but he\u8217\'20\'19s a complete disaster \u8212\'20\'14 intellectually and morally. He says he\u8217\'20\'19s worried about fruitcakes but I think he\u8217\'20\'19s one himself. He\u8217\'20\'19s turned Ukip into his own fiefdom."\par \par \uc2 Sked believes his successor has betrayed the original premise of Ukip by starting to campaign against \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , wind farms and gay marriage and for grammar schools, the Commonwealth and hunting.\par \par \uc2 He worries that Farage isn\u8217\'20\'19t clever enough. \u8220\'20\'1CNigel isn\u8217\'20\'19t very bright. When he was a candidate for Salisbury, I used to get letters saying, \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19m glad your candidate believes in education but until he learns to spell it I\u8217\'20\'19m not going to vote for him\u8217\'20\'19."\par \par \uc2 A former Ukip member who defected to the Conservatives says: \u8220\'20\'1CNigel\u8217\'20\'19s been a rebel all his life. He comes through to me as somebody who\u8217\'20\'19s been bullied when he was young. I don\u8217\'20\'19t think he has any discipline \u8212\'20\'14 he doesn\u8217\'20\'19t want to deal with detail or organisation. He\u8217\'20\'19s like a spoilt child. That\u8217\'20\'19s why he surrounds himself with people who will always say what he wants. He is an amiable character when he is in the pub but he can be a very selfish man. I was very disappointed."\par \par \uc2 Farage, of course, would disagree. \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t hide, I don\u8217\'20\'19t change my message according to my audience, I try to just be me wherever I go," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople either like you or dislike you, but if you try and pretend to be what you\u8217\'20\'19re not, you always get found out anyway. So there\u8217\'20\'19s no point in doing it.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI believe in the values we stand for and the agenda we\u8217\'20\'19re pushing and I try and sell it to people. I do my best and then people make up their own minds."\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140311ea3b000fb\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 Taxpayers foot judges' \u163\'00\'A3100m pension bill; EXCLUSIVE; MORE THAN \u163\'00\'A3100MILLION of taxpayers' cash is being used each year to fund gold-plated pensions for JUDGES, the Sun can reveal.\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVE HAWKES, Deputy Political Editor   \par \uc2 304 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 March 2014\par 00:55\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd.

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 THE RICHARD LITTLEJOHN COLUMN\b0\par\par\uc2 BY RICHARD LITTLEJOHN   \par \uc2 1,436 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 March 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 'WHO CAN I SUE?' SAID THE DRUNKEN SAILORMy dad wasn't much of a drinker. He'd make a couple of large gin and tonics last all night. I never saw him drunk.He once explained to me how, as a young sailor in World War II, he'd gone on shore-leave in Casablanca, only to wake up back on board ship the next day with absolutely no memory of the night before.He had been carried back to his bunk after getting paralytic on dark rum. His apocalyptic hangover lasted for days and he vowed there and then never to get himself in such a state again.I tell this story simply to illustrate that sailors occasionally get legless. It is nobody's fault but their own.If my dad had fallen overboard, or seriously injured himself, he wouldn't have dreamed of blaming someone else, let alone suing for damages. How times have changed.\par \par \uc2  Lieutenant Kirsty Wallace received \u163\'00\'A31?million in compensation from the Navy for injuries sustained while she was three sheets to the wind.Seven years ago, she hurt her back after falling off the top of a human pyramid during alcohol-fuelled high-jinks in the mess.Despite fears she would be paralysed for life, she managed to stand with splints after six weeks and walked up the aisle at her subsequent wedding in 2011. I'm not making light of her injuries. Lt Wallace was determined to rebuild her life and is now a paralympic basketball player.But why should she have been handed \u163\'00\'A31?million in damages? It wasn't the Navy's fault. They didn't get her drunk or force her to climb on top of a 30ft-tall human pyramid. She brought her misfortune on herself. Lt Walker has retrained and is still in the Navy, receiving her salary.While she is entitled to her medical treatment and rehab, there is absolutely no justification for giving her a Lottery-style pay-day at taxpayers' expense.Her seven-figure settlement is almost twice as much as the maximum \u163\'00\'A3570,000 compensation to soldiers maimed on active service \u8212\'20\'14 such as paratrooper Ben Parkinson, who lost his legs to a mine in Afghanistan.Lt Walker deserves our sympathy. Many of us have done something daft after a few sherbets. But this was her own fault and she shouldn't be entitled to a single penny.Heaven knows what my late father's generation of sailors would make of it. They'd certainly have needed a stiff drink.--THERE AIN'T NO RUM OR RAISIN FOR ITWe haven't had any Proof of Identity madness recently. So here's a bumper double shot.Reader Lynne Taylor writes to tell me that her 35-year-old daughter was asked for ID in a local Co-op store in Daventry before they would sell her a rum'*'raisin yoghurt.And Sarah Brooks emails from Derby, where she took her 16-year-old daughter to Asda to buy some school supplies.When they got to the checkout, the assistant wouldn't sell them a pair of scissors because her daughter was under 18.The scissors were made of plastic and sold in a packet labelled: 'School scissors, suitable for age 4+'.--A headline in Saturday's Mail read: 'DDT found in salmon.' If it had been the other way round \u8212\'20\'14 Salmon in DDT \u8212\'20\'14 I'd have assumed it was a review of one of the signature dishes at Heston Blumenthal's new restaurant.--This week's edition of Mind How You Go comes from Newark, Notts. Irene Gaskill tells me that police were out in the town centre at the weekend, giving away little clips with bells on.They are designed to be attached to handbags to deter bag-snatchers. Since when did it become the police's job to hand out bells?Still, we've already had them giving away flip-flops to stop drunken dopey birds falling off their stilettos, so why not bells?As Irene, wife of the brilliant cartoonist Dave Gaskill, said: 'It sounded as if the Morris Men had come to town!' --One line in a Sunday newspaper stopped me dead. My eyes alighted on a sentence which said: 'Theresa May has a Brazilian .?.?.'Now there's a novelty, as Eric Morecambe used to say. Who'd have thought it?As I read on, I realised it actually said: 'Theresa May has a Brazilian-born cleaner' and was part of a story about ministers who employ foreign domestic staff.Stop giggling at the back. --IT'S SCREAMING LORD ELVIS .?.?.Things go from bad to worse for Clegg. The Lib Dem candidate in a council by-election in Nottinghamshire was beaten into fourth place by a man calling himself Lord Biro, from the Bus Pass Elvis Party. It's one thing getting trounced by Ukip, quite another being overtaken by a man in a Hunka Hunka Burning Love jumpsuit.And never mind Bus Pass Elvis, Cleggy's mob are so unpopular these days they'd probably lose to a bloke dressed up as Jimmy Savile. --A FEW OF CLEGGY'S FAVOURITE THINGSNick Clegg went into 'Love Actually' mode at the weekend, spouting an extraordinary, sentimental list of everything he adores about Britain.He told a Lib Dem gathering in London that he was unashamedly pro-EU and pro-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and his heart swelled with pride when he thought about the BBC, the \uc2 NHS\uc2  and the birth of Prince George.He also boasted about his admiration for the \uc2 European Court of Human Rights\uc2  and his commitment to spend billions of pounds every year on foreign aid to countries such as India and China.Clegg took a passing swipe at Ukip and said that when it came to the EU, he wanted the Lib Dems to be 'the party of IN'.Perhaps he should have set his speech to music. It would be an instant \uc2 YouTube\uc2  smash. Ladies and gentlemen, this column is proud to present Nick Clegg's 2014 remix of My Favourite Things?.?.?.\u160\'00\'A0Leading the Lib Dems into Coalition.Making all students pay for their\u160\'00\'A0 tuition.Waiting a fortnight to empty the bins.These are a few of my favourite things.Brussels and Strasbourg and EU directives,Relying on windmills to power our electrics,Turning a blind eye to Lord Rennard's flings,These are a few of my favourite things.When the polls close,When the vote's in, And I'm feeling sad,I simply remember my favourite thingsAnd then I don't feel so bad.Taking my place at the Cabinet table,Laughing as Cameron slaps down\u160\'00\'A0 Vince Cable,Blaming the Tories for everything,These are a few of my favourite things.Winning elections in places like Truro,Scrapping the pound and embracing the euro,Squeezing the pips of the rich till it stings,These are a few of my favourite things.When the polls close,When the vote's in, And I'm feeling sad,I simply remember my favourite thingsAnd then I don't feel so bad.Bashing the bankers and taxes on mansions,Raising fuel duty and raiding your pensions,Making the Lib Dems the party of IN,These are a few of my favourite things.Human rights lawyers and European judges,Meetings in Brussels and outrageous fudges,No referendum 'cos Ukip might win,These are a few of my favourite things.When the polls close,When the vote's in, And I'm feeling sad,I simply remember my favourite thingsAnd then I don't feel so bad.Reading the Guardian every morning,Putting up taxes to fight global warming,Shedding a tear over our future king,These are a few of my favourite things.Ending Press freedom after three hundred years,Silencing newspapers' insults and smears,Stitching up deals over pizza and wings,These are a few of my favourite things.When the polls close,When the vote's in, And I'm feeling sad,I simply remember my favourite thingsAnd then I don't feel so bad.Handing out billions to countries in Asia,Making it legal to perform euthanasia,Millions of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , let them all in,These are a few of my favourite things.Cutting the money for Sheffield's foundries,Stopping the Tories redrawing the boundaries,Rigging the system so Miliband wins,These are a few of my favourite things.When the polls close,When the vote's in, And I'm feeling sad,I simply remember my favourite thingsWhich prove beyond doubt: I'm mad!\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140310ea3b0000l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 BBC IS GROTESQUELY OVER-MANAGED AND HAS A LIBERAL BIAS\b0\par\par\uc2 BY ALASDAIR GLENNIE TV CORRESPONDENT   \par \uc2 643 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 March 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 THE BBC is 'grotesquely over managed' and has always had a 'broadly liberal' bias, one of its leading journalists has admitted.\par \par \uc2 John Humphrys said the corporation's reporting on issues such as \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and the \uc2 European Union\uc2  has not been sufficiently sceptical.\par \par \uc2 But while the Today presenter's comments merely confirm what many of the BBC's critics have known for years, his analysis of the reasons for its Left-wing bias is more contentious.\par \par \uc2 The 70-year-old said that BBC staff are more likely to be liberal rather than conservative because they are the 'best and the brightest' and tend to be university educated.\par \par \uc2 'The BBC has tended over the years to be broadly liberal as opposed to broadly conservative for all sorts of perfectly understandable reasons,' he told the Radio Times.\par \par \uc2 'The sort of people we've recruited - the best and the brightest - tended to come from universities and backgrounds where they're more likely to hold broadly liberal views than conservative.'\par \par \uc2 On the BBC's reporting, he said: 'We weren't sufficiently sceptical - that's the most accurate phrase - of the pro-European case. We bought into the European ideal.\par \par \uc2 'We weren't sufficiently sceptical about the pro-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  argument. We didn't look at the potential negatives with sufficient rigour.'\par \par \uc2 Humphrys claimed the BBC is no longer so biased towards the EU, saying: 'I think we're out of that now. I think we have changed.'\par \par \uc2 But he broadened his criticisms of his employer by saying it has too many managers and needs to be slimmed down.\par \par \uc2 He said: 'There are too many of them. I think they think that. I think [director general] \uc2 Tony Hall\uc2  thinks that - I don't know, I haven't asked him, but I think he thinks that. Over the years we've been grotesquely over-managed, there's no question. They're now getting a grip on it. A lot have gone. I think more need to go.'\par \par \uc2 This is not the first time Humphrys has publicly attacked the BBC. In January, he said the corporation is too big and is obsessed by 'box-ticking'.\par \par \uc2 In the Radio Times interview Humphrys also dismissed reports that he and his fellow Today programme presenter \uc2 Mishal Husain\uc2  do not get on.\par \par \uc2 In 2009, it was reported she felt humiliated by him on an episode of Celebrity Mastermind, which he hosts, when he asked her whether she had her job only because she is good looking.\par \par \uc2 But Humphrys said there is no ill-feeling and the remarks were taken out of context. He said: 'I was making the point that it helps in the newsreading business - and this isn't controversial, you only have to switch on the telly - to be young and beautiful and highly trained. She's a proper journalist.'\par \par \uc2 Writing in the same edition of Radio Times, Humprhys' Radio 4 colleague Eddie Mair, who presents PM, also criticised the BBC's management culture.\par \par \uc2 He wrote: 'At PM, we tried to start a new project, and to get approval we had to spend three weeks in meetings with different bits of the BBC. We dutifully dealt with all their queries and eventually got the go-ahead. Hooray!\par \par \uc2 'Two days after starting the project, another part of the corporation showed up and told us to stop. We were bewildered.'\par \par \uc2 He added: 'There is always time for dissing other parts of the corporation and whining about how things used to be better. But I've been told to stop all that, it's unprofessional.'\par \par \uc2 Last year Lord Hall said the BBC could have responded to accusations of Left-wing bias sooner and needed to include a greater range of opinions on Europe.\par \par \uc2 a.glennie@dailymail.co.uk\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140310ea3b00029\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 UKIP could win 30 per cent of the popular vote if it can get its message across, according to an academic study published today.\par \par \uc2 The analysis of the views of 100,000 voters shows support for the party is driven not just by Euroscepticism but also by hostility to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and intense dissatisfaction with the three main parties.\par \par \uc2 It suggests that a third of voters share at least two of these values and might be persuaded to vote for UKIP. The study also finds the party's potential support has increased since the start of the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Robert Ford, a \uc2 University of Manchester\uc2  academic and co-author of the report, said: 'UKIP are winning over one voter in ten but their potential far exceeds their current support in the polls by a margin of three to one. This revolt has been a long time coming, but may have a long way to run.'\par \par \uc2 The study suggests that UKIP is increasingly attracting working class voters and others who feel 'left behind' and are not part of the educated and middle class mainstream.\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140310ea3b0002b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 IMMIGRATION\uc2  JUDGE LIVED WITH WOMAN WHO IS ILLEGAL MIGRANT\b0\par\par\uc2 BY JOHN STEVENS AND JIM NORTON   \par \uc2 675 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 March 2014\par \uc2 Daily Mail\par \uc2 DAIM\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A JUDGE accused of going soft on foreign criminals has stepped down after admitting handing cash to an illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  who had lived in his home.\par \par \uc2 Richard McKee, 65, was a senior judge at the country's highest \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and asylum court when he gave money to the woman, who is 26 years his junior, while she was living here illegally.\par \par \uc2 The Nigerian woman, Fatima Umar, 39, was found to have overstayed her visa after she was arrested at Mr McKee's house after a disagreement. She now faces being deported.\par \par \uc2 Mr McKee, who has previously been accused of ruling far more often than other judges in favour of those seeking to avoid deportation, has been allowed to retire on a pension of around \u163\'00\'A350,000 a year without disciplinary action.\par \par \uc2 Police had been called to Mr McKee's \u163\'00\'A3460,000 flat in Kilburn, North West London, in the afternoon of January 28 after a report of a break in.\par \par \uc2 Umar was arrested and charged with causing around \u163\'00\'A35,000 of criminal damage at the property and assaulting two police officers. She is now serving two eight-week prison sentences.\par \par \uc2 When the judiciary was informed that Mr McKee had been providing financial support to an illegal \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  he was allowed to retire without any penalty.\par \par \uc2 It is thought that Mr McKee had allowed the 'pretty' younger woman to live at his property on and off for the last few years. He has refused to comment on the nature of their relationship.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, Umar was sentenced to 14 weeks in jail after she assaulted the judge.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Mr McKee was given a reprimand for falling 'short of the standards expected' of judges after he failed to inform the judiciary that police were investigating the use of his 'premises' for unlawful activities.\par \par \uc2 One of Mr McKee's neighbours last night said that Umar was attractive, but seemed like she had problems. The woman said: 'She was a really nice lady, very friendly and polite and she would always ask how my children were. She was very skinny and pretty.\par \par \uc2 'But she looked like she was off it most of the time. Whether it was drugs or alcohol, I don't know, but she always looked pretty much out of it.'\par \par \uc2 On the day she was arrested, neighbours said she was taken from the property kicking and screaming.\par \par \uc2 Mr McKee, a Cambridge graduate, worked for the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Advisory Service as a barrister in the 1990s, bringing appeals for \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and asylum seekers, before he started adjudicating on cases in 2000.\par \par \uc2 An analysis of his judgements in 2012 found that in the 13 cases he heard in the previous year, he ruled in favour of foreign criminals wanting to avoid deportation on 11 occasions.\par \par \uc2 At the same time another judge ruled against all nine criminals whose cases he heard.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the Judiciary said: 'On 31 January 2014 it was brought to the Chamber President's attention that Upper Tribunal Judge McKee was providing financial support to a person who was alleged to be an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  offender.\par \par \uc2 'This was put to Mr McKee who then retired with effect from 4 February.' He said there would not be a review of Mr McKee's rulings as 'this is a personal conduct matter'.\par \par \uc2 A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Fatima Umar is currently serving an eight week sentence after admitting one count of criminal damage and three counts of assault at Hendon Magistrates' Court on January 30 this year.\par \par \uc2 Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab criticised the decision to allow Mr McKee to retire with a full pension. He said: 'It beggars belief that a judge tasked with defending our borders has been helping someone who has flouted them, only to walk away with a full pension. Those who uphold the law should not be above the law.'\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, Mr McKee said: 'I'm sorry, I can't really say anything.'\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140310ea3b0002f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw246\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3690\pichgoal600

It said that young people showed the most marked educational differences.\par \par \uc2 And it claimed that people from Chinese, Indian and African backgrounds are now ahead of white British people in academic achievement, and that Bangladeshis and Pakistanis are quickly catching up.\par \par \uc2 The only foreign-born ethnic group that lagged behind people born in Britain was the collection of people who identified themselves in the census as Irish travellers, with six out of ten having no qualifications and fewer than one in ten attaining a degree or an equivalent.\par \par \uc2 The study said: 'Across all ages, over a third of people born outside the UK had degree-level qualifications compared with a quarter of people born in Britain. Similarly, the foreign-born population were less likely to be without any qualifications than the UK-born population.'\par \par \uc2 And lead researcher Kitty Lymperopoulou said: 'Over the last 20 years, educational attainment has been increasing among ethnic groups as a result of an improvement in access to education overseas.'\par \par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Daily Mail\par \par \uc2 Document DAIM000020140310ea3b0002g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw259\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3885\pichgoal600
