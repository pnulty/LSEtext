\par\par \uc2 Guardian Home Pages\par \b \uc2 Farage has nasty view of world, says Clegg: Attack follows remarks about Romanians Campaigning steps up as elections approach\b0\par\par\uc2 Patrick Wintour Political editor   \par \uc2 969 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg said yesterday that Ukip leader Nigel Farage's mask was beginning to slip, and that "behind the beer-swilling bonhomie is a really nasty view of the world" and of modern Britain.\par \par \uc2 The deputy prime minister made the comment as he urged those opposed to divisive politics to vote against Ukip in European and local elections this week. At the same time a YouGov poll showed that the balance of those questioned who think Farage is doing a good job has fallen from +25 six weeks ago to +8, still good for a British party leader.\par \par \uc2 Clegg's remarks were prompted by Farage's claim last week that he would not want Romanians to be his neighbours in London, but that Germans would be different - Farage is married to a German woman. Clegg said the Ukip leader was offering the politics of division, which should have no place in modern Britain.\par \par \uc2 In an interview last night Farage attempted to backtrack, saying he did not use the right form of words, and adding "I was completely tired out".\par \par \uc2 He told ITV "I did not use the form of words that I would have like to have used, I should have just hit back immediately and said, look, understand there is a real problem here, you can't deny it, too much criminality from those gangs from Romania has come to London. I could have been clearer but you know what sometimes in life you get things wrong" .\par \par \uc2 The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who has stepped up his campaigning on the issue of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , accused Farage of a "racial slur" against Romanians, but said he did not believe the Ukip leader was a racist.\par \par \uc2 On BBC1's \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  programme, Clegg was asked whether Farage was a racist and said: "I think the mask is starting to slip and what has been revealed behind that beer-swilling bonhomie is a really nasty view of the world. Anyone who singles out one community or nationality and says 'I don't want to live next to them' - I think that is the politics of division, and I don't think it has any place in modern Britain."\par \par \uc2 Ukip moved to qualify its attitude to Romanians. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics the party's Suzanne Evans said: "If 10 Romanian men moved in next door to me I think I'd certainly want to ask questions, and that's obviously very different from, say, a Romanian family moving in next door. If 10 Romanian men moved into me I'd think are they being ripped off by an unscrupulous landlord? In which case I'd be concerned. I'd think are they up to no good? In which case I'd be concerned."\par \par \uc2 With all political leaders stepping up their campaigning before Thursday's elections, the polls failed to show any consistent pattern, except that the Liberal Democrats are in danger of losing all their MEPs.\par \par \uc2 Clegg predicted that his party would hold to its course after the European elections, dismissing suggestions that there would be a challenge to his leadership or calls to quit the coalition. He said it would be self-defeating for the party to lose its nerve just when its policies were being vindicated. "Most Liberal Democrats are immensely proud of our resilience and our unity, and that despite the endless breathless predictions that we are seeing again right now we have delivered." He said he had lost count of the number of predictions of the government falling apart.\par \par \uc2 Clegg added: "In those areas where we were able to get our message across, knocking on doors, explaining what we have done, we will do better than people predict." Elsewhere he said the results would be "very, very challenging", but he disputed that this would have implications for the general election.\par \par \uc2 He said he was not a pollster or soothsayer, but claimed: "One of the things that the Westminster-based media has not picked up at all is the huge blow to traditional Labour support in the traditional Labour heartlands in the north at the hands of Ukip." He also accused the Conservatives of running a "hokey-cokey" strategy over renegotiation on the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . The Tory minister \uc2 Michael Fallon\uc2  indicated on Friday that the party would campaign to leave the EU in a potential referendum in 2017 if it was unable to secure its programme of reform.\par \par \uc2 In an interview on the Murnaghan programme on Sky News yesterday, Miliband condemned Farage's comments on Romanians, saying: "I think his remarks were deeply offensive . . . I think they were a racial slur but I don't think of Nigel Farage as a racist himself. They were inappropriate, and wrong, and he should not have made them."\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives' new culture secretary, Sajid Javid, yesterday said \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who came to live in Britain needed to learn English and to "respect our way of life". Javid, the son of Pakistani \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and the first Asian secretary of state, is likely to be a better conveyor of the Tories' tough line on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  than some previous Tory spokesmen.\par \par \uc2 "People want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right," he told the Sunday Telegraph. "People also say, when \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  do come to Britain, that they should come to work, and make a contribution and that they should also respect our way of life, and I agree with all of that. It means things like trying to learn English."\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage campaigning with Ukip European parliamentary candidate Henry Reilly (second left) in County Antrim Photograph: Brian Little/Presseye\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140518ea5j0002y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg claimed yesterday that Westminster-based media were missing the big story of the European elections - the extent to which Ukip is eating into traditional Labour northern heartlands in the local and European elections.\par \par \uc2 There may be some wishful thinking in this analysis. Clegg at one time wanted the Liberal Democrats to become the challengers to Labour's northern heartlands, and instead he has seen his party pushed back, replaced by Nigel Farage's. Inquests will await the election results, but the Clegg theme chimes with some thinking in the shadow cabinet.\par \par \uc2 The question of whether Labour did enough to combat Ukip both by reassuring potential Labour voters on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and by portraying Farage and his acolytes as rightwing Thatcherites has been bubbling for weeks.\par \par \uc2 Both the Blue Labour wing - loosely supporters of Jon Cruddas - and some more traditional centre-right Labour figures have urged a stronger attack on Ukip. One shadow cabinet source pointed to a weekend YouGov poll showing that more than 60% of voters admitted they did not know anything about Ukip's policy on the economy, crime, \uc2 NHS\uc2 , defence or education. Those figures arguably show how far Farage has been let off the hook. Farage himself has made a virtue of refusing to discuss domestic policy.\par \par \uc2 There is a view that Ukip is almost immune to rational political attack, since it represents a resentment incapable of being shifted by reason. Clegg found himself caught out by this during his televised debates with Farage. Equally there is a view that any attack on Ukip has to be carefully calibrated or else it comes across as a patronising misreading of voters' legitimate anger. There is also a third, slightly cynical view. If Ukip performs at 5%-7% in the general election, that may help Labour since the bulk of the Ukip vote will be former Tories.\par \par \uc2 There is a big debate among pollsters and politicians about whether this holds true. Many potential Ukip voters hold traditionally leftwing views on tax and equality. There is also a wider issue that unchallenged, Ukip's presence drags the political agenda to the right, making it more difficult to get a hearing for Miliband's solutions to the ills it plays upon.\par \par \uc2 Miliband has honourably chosen to fight a relatively policy-rich campaign highlighting the issues he believes will resonate with core voters - 48-hour access to GPs, tighter regulation of private sector rents and zero-hours contracts, changes to the way in which social care is delivered, and help for the low paid. Equally, he has long rejected the David Cameron course of appeasing the Eurosceptics, saying he will not offer a definite in-out referendum on EU membership.\par \par \uc2 Labour strategists also point out that Miliband mounted an attack on Farage in a lengthy piece in the Daily Mirror at the outset of the campaign, adding it was always intended that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  feature in the closing days of the campaign. A recurrent theme since he became leader has been to insist that the free movement of workers must not become a means to exploit the indigenous workforce.\par \par \uc2 But it is notable that the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, last night chose to go on the offensive claiming that it was Tory and Lib Dem commitment to the free labour market that led the two parties to ignore the impact of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and made it possible for Ukip to play on people's fears.\par \par \uc2 Patrick Wintour\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140518ea5j0002x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Features Pages\par \b \uc2 G2: Hideously Diverse Britain We must recognise the worth of foreign students\b0\par\par\uc2 392 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Don't expect much soul searching this side of the election. Which is a shame because there is a good deal to be done. A great many activists and newspapers and politicians will want to reflect on the hysteria they caused late last year when they said the country would be overrun by Romanians and Bulgarians come 1 January.\par \par \uc2 This column said that prediction was hogwash, and that other countries available to those migrants would take priority, not least because of the language transferability. Last week's official figures showed that the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working here actually fell. Apologies are in order, but don't hold your breath.\par \par \uc2 There might also be a degree of contrition about foreign students. We were told the government realised their value. They should. We took pounds 4.4bn in fees and accommodation costs from foreign students in 2011-12. Of that, pounds 3.8bn was collected from those whose origins lie outside the EU. The Department for Business, Industry and Skills estimates their total value at pounds 14bn.\par \par \uc2 But while those figures stare us in the face, we can't resist making foreign students part of the toxic \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  debate. There is a cost to that folly. According to a survey by student recruitment specialists Hobsons, we are falling further behind in the so\u8209\'20\'11called "global race" for these students. Why? Because ministers have allowed the perception that they are not wanted here to gain currency abroad.\par \par \uc2 Hobsons surveyed 18,393 students from more than 195 countries and found that the UK, the US and Australia are still the three most desired places to study in. But of those who decided against coming here, 16% cited our attitude to international students. The only comfort was that Australia fared worse.\par \par \uc2 "Too little is being done to demonstrate to international students that both the UK and Australia welcomes them," says the study. New thinking is needed and "\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy and practice must reflect this."\par \par \uc2 And here's the key finding: "The overwhelming majority of potential international students are not motivated by a desire to live in the UK after graduation." They are not vagabonds and stowaways. They are students and we need them. We might reflect on that.\par \par \uc2 Hugh Muir\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140518ea5j0000u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Title Selfish, Whining Monkeys\par \par \uc2 Author Rod Liddle\par \par \uc2 Publisher 4th Estate\par \par \uc2 Price pounds 14.99\par \par \uc2 Oi, you. Yes you, you poncey metropolitan elite. Put down that Richard Littlejohn autobiography. And shut up about Clarkson. How come they get all the attention and you forget there's another irritating gobshite on the block? I can be offensive, too. Wog. There. I'll say it again. Wog. My parents didn't like wogs. Chinks. My parents weren't too keen on them, either. They once went on an aeroplane and there was a gay cabin steward. Gay. Pansy. Actually I quite like gays. Some of my best friends are gay. Muggers, obese chav monkeys . . . Oi, I said, don't ignore me. I couldn't bear it if you ignored me. Or if you weren't offended.\par \par \uc2 My parents may not have loved wogs but they loved Britain. And I love it, too. But it's turned into a shit hole. And you know why? It's not the wogs that did it. It's Ed Miliband and Tony Blair who quote Marx while hating the working class. The only people left to stand up for the working classes are me and Ukip. I was born in Middlesbrough, but I can't remember too much about it. Don't worry, I'm not being some artsy unreliable narrator. I'm just a bit pissed and I've got to come up with something everyone is going to hate. Other than me.\par \par \uc2 Am I a hypocrite? Of course I am. But I'm a working-class hypocrite, which makes me a step up from you metropolitan elite hypocrites. At least, that's what Foucault says. So fuck you. You won't find Littlejohn or Clarkson quoting fooking Foucault. Sometimes I hate the nasty little sell out I've become. The bloke who edited Today, has a column for the Sunday Times and hangs out with media types? What a tosser. If only I could have stayed more like my parents.\par \par \uc2 My Mum never complained when she was dying of cancer. Not once. She put up with it, the way she put up with the Germans dropping bombs on her. It was just one of those things as the homosexual historian, David Starkey, would say. That's the way we should be. Before she died she received 237 Christmas cards. Last year I got 16; four of them I had to send to myself. That shows how fractured Britain has become. Or it could just show that she was a great deal nicer than me.\par \par \uc2 That's the trouble with Britain. Too much me, me, me. Which is why I want you to focus on me, rather than yourself? Who cares about all this pseudo-Islington Shami Chakrabarti individualism? So you're getting divorced because you're a bit bored with your partner and your kids are are a bit bored because the Xbox isn't working and you've had so many re-e-e-eally hard struggles? Get over yourself. We'd all be much happier just putting up with things being a bit shit - though if anyone does know of a cleaner I'd be very grateful. Kids, eh? Are they so much happier now we ask them how they feel? Most of them would be far better off being nonced by Jimmy Savile than carted off to \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  to be turned into foie gras.\par \par \uc2 Women. I love women. And women love me, too. But I'll tell you this, love - yes, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown I'm talking to you - if you really want equality, you've got to shape up a bit. As Emile Durkheim once said, if you want the job, then don't have the baby. Maternity leave? You're having a laugh. Which brings me on to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . R-A-A-A-A-ACIST. Go on, say it. But it's got to be said. Me and the working classes have got nothing against foreigners, but Britain is full. So they can all fuck off.\par \par \uc2 You know who I hate the most? Lawyers. Especially the ones who stiffed me out of pounds 180k for my divorce. Bankers. I hate them too. Fucking leeching cunts. Politicians. Cheats and liars, all of them. But most of all I hate you miserable gluten-intolerant faux-lefties who claim to have ME. Why can't you get a proper fucking illness like cancer? I didn't mean that. I am totally pissed now. Just please don't leave me. I couldn't bear it if no one was reading any more.\par \par \uc2 The digested read, digested:\par \par \uc2 A selfish, whining monkey writes . . .\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140518ea5j0000t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Guardian Comment and Debate Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: Racism is far more than old white men using the N-word: Why is there outrage only when epithets are caught on tape? Discrimination is in reality carried out by well-mannered people\b0\par\par\uc2 Gary Younge   \par \uc2 1,155 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 May 2014\par \uc2 The Guardian\par \uc2 GRDN\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Let's hear it for \uc2 Robert Copeland\uc2 . The police commissioner of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire (population 6,083) sticks to his principles. Even if those principles are stuck in a previous century and mired in bigotry. In March Jane O'Toole was finishing her dinner at a bistro in town when she heard Copeland, 82, announce loudly that he hated watching television because every time he turned on the TV he kept seeing "that fucking nigger". The "nigger" in question was the president of the United States.\par \par \uc2 O'Toole had no idea who Copeland was at the time. But when she found out, she wrote to the town manager to complain. Copeland was unrepentant. "I believe I did use the 'N-word' in reference to the current occupant of the Whitehouse," he wrote in an email to his fellow police commissioners. "For this, I do not apologise - he meets and exceeds my criteria for such."\par \par \uc2 Such candour is rare nowadays, even if the furore is not. Over the last few weeks incidents like this have become tiresomely regular. First came Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher in a standoff with the government over refusing to pay his grazing taxes. His elevation as a Conservative folk hero stalled after he opined on whether the "Negro" shouldn't be back in chains. "I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom."\par \par \uc2 Just a couple of days later a tape emerged of Donald Sterling, the manager of the \uc2 LA Clippers\uc2  basketball team, asking his girlfriend not to take pictures with black friends or bring them to games. "Admire him, bring him here, feed him, fuck him," he said of former basketball legend, Magic Johnson. "But don't put him on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me."\par \par \uc2 A week later British TV host Jeremy Clarkson was caught on camera reciting a version of "eeny, meeny, miny, moe" from his childhood ("before racism was bad" as The Office's David Brent once put it) in which he continues muttering "catch a nigger by the toe".\par \par \uc2 By the time Copeland's outburst became a matter of national note a week later, the pattern had been set: old white men with mouths writing cheques their status won't cash, in currencies that went out of date decades ago. So far so bad. None are worthy of sympathy.\par \par \uc2 And yet the magnitude of the response to each incident exemplifies how high the bar is now set for challenging racist behaviour and how distorted our understanding has become of what that behaviour constitutes.\par \par \uc2 Before there can be outrage, the offending party must be caught red-handed - preferably on tape - using the worst epithets and most egregious insults. Clarkson previously maligning Mexicans as "lazy, feckless and flatulent", or making jokes about "black Muslim lesbians", or Sterling twice being fined by the department of justice for being a racist slumlord, didn't quite cut it.\par \par \uc2 And so the perception - on both sides of the Atlantic - takes hold that racism is not a system of discrimination planted by history, nourished by politics and nurtured by economics, in which some groups face endemic disadvantage - it's about ignorant old people getting caught saying mean things. By privileging these episodes - outrageous as they are - racism is basically reduced to the level of a private, individual indiscretion made public. The scandal becomes not that racism exists but that anyone would be crass enough to articulate it so brazenly.\par \par \uc2 The reality of modern racism is almost exactly the opposite: it's the institutional marginalisation of groups performed with the utmost discretion and minimum of fuss by well-mannered and often well-intentioned people working in deeply flawed systems. According to a recent \uc2 US department of education\uc2  report, black preschoolers (mostly four-year-olds) are four times more likely to be suspended more than once than their white classmates. According to a 2013 report by Release, a UK group focusing on drugs and drug laws, black people in England and Wales are far less likely to use drugs than white people but six times more likely to be stopped and searched for possession of them. In both countries black people are far more likely to be convicted, and to get stiffer sentences and longer jail time.\par \par \uc2 This is the soporific, statistical drumbeat to which black children march through our institutions and to which society as a whole has become inured. You are unlikely to find many of these preschool teachers throwing around the N-word or judges reminiscing about slavery. Apparently, until you do, there will be no big story here. It's just the way we do things. The problem is no longer that it's brazen, but that it's banal.\par \par \uc2 This is what makes attempts to defend a party like the Ukip from accusations of racism so hollow. Of course, that is not the sole nature of its appeal. But its calls for social housing to go first to those whose "parents and grandparents were born locally"; and a recent poll revealed that more than half its supporters believe \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and their British-born children should be "encouraged to leave the country".\par \par \uc2 These are unsophisticated codes for the kind of policies that will entrench inequalities, starting at the border and extending from the classroom to the courtroom. Racism is central to Ukip's meaning, even when it is not explicitly included in its message. Last Friday its leader, Nigel Farage, said: "Any normal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door."\par \par \uc2 It seems only when he is personally caught, on camera, repeating that Smethwick slogan from 1964 - "If you want a nigger for a neighbour vote Labour" - will the doubters be convinced.\par \par \uc2 Politically, at least, this was always the point. Racism is a hardy virus that mutates to adapt to the body politic in which it is embedded. You can't wipe it out with a single shot because by the time you've dealt with the last strain, a new one has developed resistant to previous remedies. "You have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks," President Richard Nixon once explained to his chief of staff. "The key is to devise a system that recognises that while not appearing to." That system is in place, even if some are more skilled at keeping up appearances than others.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @garyyounge\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140518ea5j0000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer Review Features Pages\par \b \uc2 The New Review: COVER STORY: Belle of the ball: Ghanaian-British director Amma Asante's film Belle has taken America by storm and established her as a major talent. Like Steve McQueen's Oscar winner, the movie addresses slavery - but this time from a British perspective. It's a long way from her days on the other side of the camera in Grange Hill...\b0\par\par\uc2 BY KATE KELLAWAY   \par \uc2 3,154 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Amma Asante sits at the corner table of a London roof-garden cafe on a bright morning - British-born of Ghanaian parents, she finds herself, as one of our most promising film directors, at a turning point in her career. It is a strange moment for her because, by some serendipitous twist, her first major feature film, Belle (her indie debut, A Way of Life, won her a Bafta in 2005), is about slavery and follows on the heels of Steve McQueen's Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave. An impossible act to follow, you might suppose. Yet the two films could hardly be more different.\par \par \uc2 "I wouldn't want audiences to come to Belle and think they were about to see '12 Years a Slave Mark 2'," Asante says. Based in Britain and rooted in fact, Belle is an extraordinary story, she tells me: Dido Elizabeth Belle (1761-1804) was the daughter of John Lindsay, a British admiral, and an African slave. She grew up in Kenwood House, Hampstead, under the guardianship of Lord Chief Justice Mansfield - her father was Mansfield's nephew and, contrary to what you would expect of the period, she was raised almost as an equal to his other great niece, Lady Elizabeth Murray. The film - with Tom Wilkinson as Mansfield, Penelope Wilton as Lady Mary Murray and the bewitchingly beautiful Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Belle - pursues the possibility that she influenced her guardian into legal rulings that would eventually lead to the abolition of slavery. It has just opened in the US to a chorus of approval and with the unexpected distinction of beating the new Spider-man at the box office on its opening weekend in most of the cinemas in which it was screened (not to mention encouraging Oprah to tweet about it). But Asante is not a woman to swank and appears to have no sense of what seems certain from where I'm sitting: she is fated to be feted.\par \par \uc2 When she first heard rumours of McQueen's "slave movie", she was already filming her own. "I didn't know anything about the film itself. When you are making a movie, your head is completely buried." But she remembers being horrified by the demeaning phrase "slave movie" - as if it were now a genre. She had no idea the rival film was the story of Solomon Northup, who started out as a free man. But one should not be surprised at the collision: slavery does not go away as a subject - as today's abducted Nigerian schoolgirls threatened with being sold as sex slaves horribly demonstrates. In art, too, it crops up where you least expect it - take the National Portrait Gallery, where you can see (until July) the earliest British portrait of a freed slave, Ayuba Suleiman Diallo, accompanied by a poem by Ben Okri to dramatise his enigmatic history.\par \par \uc2 It would be grotesque were the power of 12 Years a Slave to eclipse the beauty of Belle. McQueen's film is a brilliant, raw, punishing tour de force. Belle is a costume drama "in the spirit of Jane Austen, it describes a genteel world that existed while the parallel world of slavery was going on". The film has a golden quality - without being sentimental or false. And it does what McQueen's film did not. It reminds us that the history of slavery belongs to Britain as well as to the US. In the 18th century, the British empire's economy depended on the slave trade. In Georgian Britain, there were about 15,000 black people - mainly in London - and less than a third of that population was free.\par \par \uc2 But before we pursue this further, I want to clear up a puzzle about the film's evolution. The screenplay is credited to Misan Sagay, the Anglo-Nigerian writer who started the project and who, after years of trying to launch it - with HBO initially - had to abandon it because of ill health. The film's authorship has been a contested issue but Sagay has been ruled, by the Writers Guild of America, West, as its author. Asante's involvement began at the point where Sagay left off, which meant that when producer Damian Jones sent her a postcard of the painting that inspired Sagay and that used to hang in Kenwood, attributed to Johann Zoffany (circa 1778), she was free to "derive from it whatever I wanted". She has invested a huge amount of energy into making the script work for her directorial concept of the film. It took four years to get made and Asante was, she has said, still doing rewrites on her wedding day.\par \par \uc2 "Everything you will have taken thematically from the film is what the portrait said to me the first time I saw it," she explains. In Zoffany's painting, Dido and Elizabeth are side by side in a country park. Elizabeth, in a lustrous pink frock, is given subtly preferential treatment: her pale complexion catches the light. Dido looks as if she is about to leave, an acknowledgement, perhaps, that it is unusual she should be in the frame at all. She holds a basket of fruit at a dangerous tilt. Her right index finger pensively stabs her cheek. Her playful expression is of a piece with the jaunty feather that tops her turban. Elizabeth detains her with a smile and a hand on one elbow. If not a picture of perfect equality, it is the friendliest of starts. "I looked at that portrait and thought: oh my God - look how Elizabeth loves her! I have never seen a person of colour in a painting from this period not being treated as a pet." And to prove the point, Asante includes in her film several late-18th-century paintings: black figures boosting white subjects, looking deferentially upwards from the corners of canvases.\par \par \uc2 What did Belle's face say to Asante? "It said: I am here. I'm relevant. I'm a lady. I'm brown. I'm made up of many things. I'm happy with who I am." What emerges in the film is that Lord Mansfield was happy with who she was too - their mutual affection a matter of historical record. According to a forthcoming book by Paula Byrne, before his death, Lord Mansfield left Belle a portrait of himself (slightly vainly perhaps) to remind her of "one she knew from her infancy, and always honoured with uninterrupted confidence and friendship". He also put in writing, lest there be any doubt after his death: "I confirm to Dido Elizabeth Belle her freedom." He was taking no chances.\par \par \uc2 It was in 1772 that Lord Mansfield first ruled that "chattel slavery was not supported by law". But the film focuses on the later and more dramatic Zong case, which he also oversaw. In 1781, the Zong, a congested slave ship, left Africa for Jamaica and after an epidemic on board, a third of the slaves - 142 men - were thrown into the sea. The captain's intention was to claim insurance money on their lives (at pounds 30 each) and to insist their deaths were inevitable (they would pretend the water had run out). When it was discovered there was no water shortage - it had rained heavily - the insurers refused to pay up and the case came to court.\par \par \uc2 The point in the film where Lord Mansfield makes his ruling is thrilling and moving because, for him and his ward, this judgment was also personal. Asante was fascinated by the tension between "instinct and conditioning" in the characters. She is "obsessed" with Lord Mansfield, seeing him as a reluctant radical.\par \par \uc2 What makes Belle an overwhelming film is its warmth - the camera has a loving eye. "It was my loving eye," Asante says. And she admits: "I can't come to a character unless I love them." She explains how, when she starts on a film, she writes down "a couple of thematic words, then I fold the piece of paper, forget about it and hope the words I've written come back to me in people's reactions once the movie is made." The words, in this case, were "love and courage". But what she could not know, as she folded the paper, was how much love and courage she was going to need herself because, during the course of making the film, her father died.\par \par \uc2 She talks energetically about him, but her eyes are shining with tears: "He died in my arms and seven-and-a-half hours later, I was filming with a hundred extras in Middle Temple, the courtroom scenes. Since his death, my world has not stopped ricocheting. The shock of seeing my father take his last breath - it still hasn't left me." She adds: "This movie only existed because my dad strived to create the tenacity and will in me to fight for it [it was four years before \uc2 Fox Searchlight\uc2  took it on]. Lord Mansfield is based on my father."\par \par \uc2 As she talks, it becomes clear the extent to which her father is key. Asante grew up in Streatham. When her father first came to Britain, he was cleaning tables and the family lived in one room without electricity and took baths in a tiny plastic tub. Her mother worked as a cleaner too, and later ran the family-owned African deli. Their fortunes changed when her father managed to qualify as an accountant.\par \par \uc2 He was loving but strict. His repertoire of sayings included the words: "What is right can never be impossible." These became Asante's touchstone: "My father would repeat that line to me - oh God, on a thrice weekly basis, there was no way I wasn't going to pay homage to him by having those words [given to Belle's father] in the film.\par \par \uc2 It was Asante's father who unexpectedly (given his conventional attitudes) decided to enrol her at the Barbara Speake Stage School in Acton as a child because, her older sister now maintains, he was worried that she was too shy to thrive. The school was "exceptional". Schoolmates included Kwame Kwei-Armah, Michelle Gayle and Naomi Campbell - all still chums. "The interesting thing about the people I have mentioned is that they are all British and black. I grew up with a generation at school who refused to see obstacles as a full stop or the end of the game."\par \par \uc2 She is matter-of-fact about the tiny number of black directors that get to the top, agreeing that she and Steve McQueen are "exceptions that prove the rule". She tells no tales yet recalls how, before making Belle, she had to defy people who would say: "Isn't this film too big for you?" Out-and-out racism (or sexism) is sometimes easier to deal with than oblique put-downs: "In a sense, I preferred it when the National Front threw bottles at us because at least we knew where we stood."\par \par \uc2 Asante started as an actor and was a regular on BBC's Grange Hill. Does she see directing as a performance too? "It is like being a barrister. No matter how you feel when you wake up, you have to be a team leader every day, hour, minute. If you let the ball go for a second, you'll see the results on screen and pay for it for the rest of the film's life and you can't afford to do that. There are many ways to lead - as women, we know that."\par \par \uc2 For her, what matters is having a "passion for the project and a vision. As a director, you are the only person carrying the bigger picture and every tiny detail. It is about keeping a cohesive, creative, motivated vibe going." When she's directing, she says, she's "wired" to the point that after shooting from 6am to 9pm, she still has energy for the next day's story boards and a quick check on the actors in their hotel rooms.\par \par \uc2 Asante's hallmark as a director is her refusal to oversimplify. Her first film, A Way of Life (2004), which won a best new British talent award at the London Film Festival, was set in a post-industrial town in south Wales. It was about a group of white teenagers who persecute and eventually murder their Turkish Muslim neighbour. The film's unsettling power derived partly from Asante's understanding of the bigoted white teenagers, the hardship of their lives, the dysfunction and deprivation behind the violence. In contrast to the gilded look of Belle, the film's style was grey and raw - hard to believe it was not a documentary. And the writing was spot-on (it was for this, as well as for her direction, that she won the Carl Foreman award at the 2005 Baftas). Leigh-Anne, its white teenage mother, says to her Turkish Muslim neighbour: "You are in someone else's country. Show a bit of respect, all right?", to which he replies with dignity: "I have been here 30 years. How long you been here?"\par \par \uc2 As the child of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , Asante has always had an "extra eye" and sees herself as an insider and outsider (all directors, she believes, need to be emotionally ambidextrous). She chose Mbatha-Raw as Belle because, as a serene black figure in 18th-century finery, she is able to be "familiar and unfamiliar at the same time". Her "innate grace fits the period and yet you look at her and say: she makes sense - and doesn't."\par \par \uc2 Asante understands Belle because: "Although I'm not bi-racial, I'm bi-cultural, I walk that division every day subtly and unsubtly, consciously and unconsciously. I am that familiar and unfamiliar character in the world." She adds that she speaks Ghanaian and accentless English - and that her parents, typically of Ghanaians, "speak English impeccably. My mother will quote you John Donne and Shakespeare at the drop of a hat in her beautiful accent."\par \par \uc2 What is striking is how Asante's life, although so different from that of the subject of her film, fed it. She maintains that even her south London upbringing contributed and quotes the line where Belle advises Elizabeth: "Wait for no man." This advice, a south London staple apparently, is sure to get a laugh of recognition when screened there. She has a territorial fondness for south London, rejoices in its mixed community, and can't stand the way people typecast it as turbulent although she adds: "I'm 44 and grew up through both Brixton riots." She remembers her brother being stopped by the police because he had a rucksack on his back. It was full of science books (he is now a scientist). "I grew up fearful of the police, which is interesting," she laughs, "because I am now married to a policeman. . ."\par \par \uc2 And with the same openness with which she talked about her father, she tells the story of falling in love with her second husband (her first was the producer Charlie Hanson). Nowadays, she lives in the Hague. When I ask whether Holland chose her or the other way round, she explains that, in 2007, love struck. She was working for a Los Angeles studio between movies: "I was researching \uc2 Europol\uc2  agents because I was trying to create an uber policewoman. \uc2 Europol\uc2  is the \uc2 FBI\uc2  of Europe - or so I am told - and the man I was sent to meet was Soren Pedersen, spokesman for European police in the Hague."\par \par \uc2 Belle's love story (she falls for an apprentice lawyer, John Davinier, who was, in real life, a manservant at Kenwood) is intended to "honour our love story". And she picks up the thread of her own story again delightedly: "Soren and I had one date and decided to move in and get married." I express disbelief. "I know! I'm a crazy woman. But I looked at him and thought: he is going to be my husband. And I didn't want to waste time because I was 37 and didn't have time to waste."\par \par \uc2 If the implication is that she hoped for children (she mentions exuberantly that she wishes she could have adopted the girl who plays young Belle - an identical twin) she is not one to languish: "We're happy with our little dog [a Yorkie] and living on the marina. Holland is very much real life for me. It has nothing to do with showbusiness because I'm not connected with the Dutch film-making world." She paints a picture of herself strolling along in flip-flops, dog at her heels: "You have to have a life because if you don't, you can't bring anything to film-making."\par \par \uc2 Post-Belle, Asante is unlikely to do much uninterrupted strolling. Her next job is to make her first Hollywood studio movie - for Warner Brothers. In Unforgettable she will be working for the first time "purely as a director" - leaving the writing to others. The casting is still "under wraps" but will include "two A-list Oscar-winning ladies". It is about a second wife terrorised by a first wife. "What interests me is that it looks at issues I love - to do with position, identity and status. Who are you when someone takes a part of your identity and moves on? As a second wife, you have to step into the shoes of someone else. I am a second wife so I know what that feels like. I call the film my there-but-for-the-grace-of-God-go-I piece. If we come from the premise that we all have a tipping point, what is the perfect storm that would tip you over the edge?"\par \par \uc2 Shooting will start in the American south in the autumn - "because it is too hot in the summer and working with two A-list actresses in the blistering heat might not be so much fun". I don't know about that. My hunch is that there is no such thing as too darn hot when it is Amma Asante you are talking about.\par \par \uc2 Belle is in cinemas from 13 June\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 'I am fascinated by the tension between instinct and conditioning': Amma Asante, photographed in Soho, London last month for the Observer New Review.\par \par \uc2 Johann Zoffany's 1778 portrait of Belle and Elizabeth, played in the film by Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Sarah Gadon (top).\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140519ea5i0004p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer Home News Pages\par \b \uc2 Special Investigation: \uc2 Serco\uc2 , the Observer, and a hunt for the truth about Yarl's Wood: Efforts to investigate repeated claims of sexual abuse by staff at the asylum centre met with resistance and led to a private company calling in reputation lawyers. After a legal battle, this paper has received a copy of an internal inquiry - but many questions remain unanswered.\b0\par\par\uc2 Mark Townsend   \par \uc2 2,855 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The report is seven pages long, bears a \uc2 Serco\uc2  logo and is signed by Ian Wills, the company's deputy head of security and operations. It is the account of an inquiry into sexual abuse allegations involving a female detainee living at the mercy of the British state.\par \par \uc2 Her care was outsourced - on behalf of all of us - to the private sector. Reading the report, it is perhaps no surprise that one of Britain's biggest contractors fought long and hard to keep its contents secret.\par \par \uc2 This weekend a new dispute has erupted over government proposals to hive off child protection services to companies such as \uc2 Serco\uc2  and G4S; perhaps the ministers and officials behind those plans should look at the case of Sana when they come to make their final decision on the future of another vulnerable section of the population.\par \par \uc2 Sana called the Observer early in 2011. Her voice trembling but resolute, she went methodically through the chain of alleged events in which she claimed she had been sexually assaulted by a healthcare worker at Yarl's Wood in Bedford, Britain's biggest \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  detention centre for women.\par \par \uc2 Her journey to Yarl's Wood had been circuitous, troubled and violent. Born in June 1983 in the Pakistani city of Lahore, her earliest childhood memories are scarred by beatings administered by her father. When she was 17, she says he threatened to kill her unless she married an older family friend. Her unwanted husband then announced they were to start a new a new life in north London. The marriage soured and turned violent.\par \par \uc2 Divorced, Sana became involved in another relationship, which also turned abusive. Having been kept in the dark by her first husband over her \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  status, Sana left the second man and applied for asylum. On 4 October 2010 she was taken to Yarl's Wood after attending a routine \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  appointment. Estranged from her family and a long-term survivor of abuse, she could hardly have been more vulnerable.\par \par \uc2 During the last of the alleged assaults on Sana, about 1.50am on 8 January 2011, she feared she was going to be raped inside Yarl's Wood, according to witness documents later handed to the courts. \uc2 Serco\uc2 's internal report recounts her claims of how a healthcare worker, whom she had approached with problems of headaches and dizziness, allegedly told her "she did not need medication but needed his penis".\par \par \uc2 It then describes her allegations of how the healthcare worker held Sana's hand and "placed it on his penis and that he touched her vaginal area outside her clothes". It was the third time over five weeks that the same man had allegedly sexually assaulted her in the confines of the centre's medical room. Terrified, she said she left and told a guard: "I am not safe here." The female guard seemed convinced by Sana's claims. Witness statements quote the \uc2 Serco\uc2  detention officer as saying it was "just so difficult not to believe that this [the allegations] is true".\par \par \uc2 Her colleagues failed to share the view. In fact, the sympathetic Serco officer would be criticised for failing to see the possibility that Sana's testimony might have been fabricated. She required guidance, senior officers concluded in the report, to become more "objective" and to dissuade her making similar snap judgments in the future.\par \par \uc2 Astonishingly, another allegation against a Yarl's Wood employee is treated as a reason to suspect that Sana, now 30, is lying about her own experience. The report points out that Sana shared a solicitor with another detainee who had recently made allegations. Therefore, there could be "an element of coercion to thwart removal directions". The alleged attacker is described as a "family man with strong religious beliefs".\par \par \uc2 Bedfordshire police came, but instead of sending specialist sex abuse officers, they sent an ordinary constable. Instead of the lengthy recorded interview usually reserved for such sensitive allegations, Sana claims her interrogation lasted only 30 minutes.\par \par \uc2 A police email to \uc2 UK Border Agency\uc2  investigators lamented a lack of independent witnesses, ignoring the fact that few sexual assaults occur in front of others. Sana even alleges that the officer accused her of "lying in order to stay in the country", a claim he denies.\par \par \uc2 The prisons and probation ombudsman was unimpressed with the police's view that Sana's allegations could not be proven, stating: "I find it difficult to understand how the police found it possible to reach such a definitive conclusion after such a brief investigation."\par \par \uc2 The case closed, and almost immediately the Home Office told her she was to be deported back to Pakistan.\par \par \uc2 "After the meeting with the police officer I returned to the wing, and a little later I was given the notice saying I would be removed to Pakistan on a flight," states her witness account. The flight was in five days' time, the minimum notice the government has to give.\par \par \uc2 For legal reasons, the Observer had been unable to run the story of Sana's allegations. But when last September the paper printed testimony from another 23-year-old who said she had unwanted sexual contact with two guards, \uc2 Serco\uc2  adopted what would become a characteristically aggressive stance. The company hired reputation management lawyers to issue a five-page letter instructing the articles "be amended to reflect the true position". Having become aware that \uc2 Serco\uc2  had conducted an internal inquiry into Sana's case, as a result of cases brought by Sana against the Home Office, \uc2 Serco\uc2  and the police over her treatment, we asked for access to the report. The company was not willing to disclose it, though the legal letter was categorical that any claim \uc2 Serco\uc2  had "perpetrated a 'cover-up' in respect of complaints is . . . unfounded". \uc2 Serco\uc2  settled Sana's claim over the assaults for a modest sum.\par \par \uc2 Then more anguished calls came from women who claimed they felt terrified and intimidated. Allegations of inappropriate behaviour reached as far back as 2007. A perception appeared to have evolved among detainees that if they flirted or slept with guards their case might be treated more favourably.\par \par \uc2 There are clear guidelines governing the behaviour of staff towards women held in the centre, but something seemed to be going badly wrong in Yarl's Wood.\par \par \uc2 Leah, 33, from Cameroon, who was in the centre twice, between 2008 and 2009, said: "The guards would flirt with the detainees. I spoke to some ladies who were in proper relationships with the guards. They used to give these women the impression that if you sleep with me I'll put in a good word for you." She said the dynamic was complicated by the fact that some detainees came from countries where having sex with guards in order to escape prison was not unusual.\par \par \uc2 Tilia, 41, from Zimbabwe, who spent 12 months in the centre from September 2011, said: "You're very vulnerable, you are thinking that if I get closer to this person he might help me out. So many girls were flirting, two or three had got to the point of having sex in exchange for favours."\par \par \uc2 Sharon, 27, from Uganda, who was at Yarl's Wood for three months from June 2012, told of hearing women talk about tolerating inappropriate behaviour for modest returns. "Small essentials like nice soap, nice hair products . . . they thought that if they gave in to demands they would get these things in return."\par \par \uc2 Some former detainees say the centre was so out of control that occasionally fights broke out after women suspected they were having sex with the same guard. Others describe impromptu discos where they witnessed guards dancing provocatively with detainees. "The girls would put on their hot pants and dance closely with these guards like in a nightclub, grinding and winding," said Sharon. The cinema is also mentioned as an alleged place for inappropriate encounters. Sandra, 25, from Uganda, whose last stint in Yarl's Wood was between May and July last year, describes looking through the door and seeing guards cuddling up to women.\par \par \uc2 More articles by the Observer prompted further activity from lawyers acting for \uc2 Serco\uc2 . One letter complained the company could not "see the basis upon which you can justify or publish" allegations from some of the women.\par \par \uc2 Serco\uc2  continued to claim it conducted thorough investigations into complaints, but refused to let the Observer see the internal report into Sana's case. During an extraordinary legal battle, \uc2 Serco\uc2  fought to keep it out of the public sphere. The Observer argued it was in the public interest to publish an inquiry into claims made by a vulnerable woman that she had been sexually assaulted on its premises. Lawyers acting for \uc2 Serco\uc2  vehemently argued there was a balancing public interest in not disclosing the confidential report.\par \par \uc2 In early December 2013 lawyers for Guardian News and Media (GNM), which owns the Observer, sought a court ruling that the \uc2 Serco\uc2  report was a public document and the newspaper was entitled to a copy, arguing its release was in the public interest. The initial high court hearing was scheduled for 7 February, but the day before \uc2 Serco\uc2 's lawyers dropped a bombshell.\par \par \uc2 The company's legal team indicated that it had "learned of a police investigation concerning a sexual assault at Yarl's Wood". \uc2 Serco\uc2  said that making its report public could prejudice that investigation. When it was established there was no overlap between that investigation and Sana's case, Mr Justice Bean delivered his judgment, saying GMG should be granted access to \uc2 Serco\uc2 's subsequent internal report and endorsing its "proper journalistic purpose in seeking to inspect a document which they believe may throw light on whether or not the allegation was properly investigated".\par \par \uc2 Many unanswered questions remain. How many witnesses and victims might have been deported before their allegations came to light? That one will almost certainly never be answered. How many allegations have there been? Available data confuses rather than clarifies the situation. A Home Office freedom of information (FoI) response, dated 23 May 2013, says that the government is aware of only four complaints "of a sexual nature from detainees" relating to contractor staff since 2008. However, a response four months later from \uc2 Serco\uc2  says it has received nearly four times that figure, stating that "over the six years we have been managing Yarl's Wood there have been a total of 15 complaints or concerns raised about inappropriate behaviour".\par \par \uc2 The figures become even more muddled when another Home Office FoI response, dated 30 April 2014, reveals it knows of only one case of sexual contact that has been substantiated since \uc2 Serco\uc2  began managing Yarl's Wood. Yet in the same response the Home Office states "seven members of [Yarl's Wood] staff have been dismissed" over the issue. For its part, \uc2 Serco\uc2 , in data provided upon request to the home affairs select committee last September, admits eight staff have been sacked or have resigned over the issue of "inappropriate behaviour".\par \par \uc2 Amid the confusion and conflicting numbers, many former detainees allege they felt too vulnerable and intimidated to formally register misgivings. Sharon, for instance, says: "I never heard anyone complaining explicitly about the nature of things, people just wanted to survive."\par \par \uc2 Others allege they came under pressure to retract accounts of inappropriate behaviour after lodging a complaint. Sana herself describes a change in attitude by guards following her complaint. "Officers started behaving differently towards me . . . many seemed to become aggressive and rude towards me."\par \par \uc2 Instead of becoming more transparent, campaigners claim that Yarl's Wood is becoming increasingly secretive. The Home Office still denies the Observer access to the detention centre. Why? Meanwhile, one campaigning group last week complained that it felt it was getting harder to contact detainees via phone. Attempts to contact the sympathetic (and female) \uc2 Serco\uc2  guard who appeared to have believed Sana's assault allegations have proved fruitless. She still works in the centre. Calls to her have been intercepted by colleagues demanding to know the intention of the conversation.\par \par \uc2 Sana's lawyer, Harriet Wistrich, has also repeatedly tried to contact the sympathetic guard without success, claiming a "closing of ranks" may have prevented her coming forward. It is not just those inside who are effectively censored. The United Nations expert into violence against women was last month refused permission to inspect Yarl's Wood by the "highest" echelons of the Home Office. Speaking from South Africa last week, Rashida Manjoo remains deeply perturbed that she was unable to conduct her high-profile investigation.\par \par \uc2 Lessons must be learned. The Home Office finds itself facing uncomfortable questions. A number of former Yarl's Wood detainees say they know of victims of inappropriate behaviour who have been deported before being able to testify, in effect silencing their stories. One woman who made allegations of sexual assault claims attempts were made to deport her to nine different countries after she complained. Detainees who claim to have witnessed sexual contact say they have also been threatened with deportation. One woman who witnessed an alleged case of sexual misconduct was detained for deportation hours before a scheduled interview with police. Only when the Observer highlighted the deportation bid was she allowed to share evidence with officers. Tilia, from Zimbabwe, said: "There are women who have been sexually abused but their voice couldn't be heard because they have been deported."\par \par \uc2 That buck stops at the door of the Home Office, which must authorise all deportations. Has it become an unwitting accomplice in silencing and removing "troublemakers"? The police appear not to have handled Sana's case well. The investigation by Bedfordshire police, which investigates Yarl's Wood allegations, was accused of being cursory at best in its inquiries. Sana's claim against the force for failing adequately to investigate her case was soon settled.\par \par \uc2 But the biggest questions are for \uc2 Serco\uc2 , a private company operating on behalf of the British state, funded by the British taxpayer. At Yarl's Wood, it deals with female detainees facing deportation, by any measure some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Does it not have a public duty to be transparent when problems arise? \uc2 Serco\uc2  chose to settle Sana's claim for a modest amount of damages "at least in part because it did not wish for the report to be published," according to one of \uc2 Serco\uc2 's lawyers.\par \par \uc2 The company should also reflect long and hard on whether it allowed a culture of automatic suspicion to develop whenever employees were faced by allegations such as Sana's. Almost from the outset, it appears \uc2 Serco\uc2  formed the opinion that Sana may have fabricated the allegation that she had been abused in order to escape removal. When people are as vulnerable as this, should not the overwhelming priority be to take their voice, their side of the story, seriously? Judging by the internal report that the Observer finally obtained, it appears this did not happen.\par \par \uc2 Described as the "biggest company you've never heard of", \uc2 Serco\uc2  was buoyant just over a year ago, with profits booming after securing a number of sizeable contracts. As reports of possible bid for child protection contracts make clear, it hopes to be a prime deliverer of many more important, sensitive services.\par \par \uc2 Inside Yarl's Wood, it is only fair to acknowledge that many campaigners acknowledge that conditions have improved profoundly over recent years. But there is still work to do, according to detainees. One recently described how guards caught her naked after they burst in on her without knocking, behaviour that breaches \uc2 Serco\uc2  guidelines and for which the detainee says that \uc2 Serco\uc2  apologised. Fundamentally, say activists, the complexities of male guards looking after female detainees needs to be challenged. Again, to be fair, it is understood that \uc2 Serco\uc2  is concentrating on recruiting more female guards.\par \par \uc2 For Sana such initiatives are too late: "It left me depressed and anxious, even now. When I think about what happened and how they decided they did not believe me, I get very sad." She is still waiting to hear whether she will be granted asylum.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 TILIA\par \par \uc2 Tilia spent 12 months in the centre, from 2011.

The Observer.

Voluntary repatriation, in which legal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  are given financial assistance to leave the UK, was supported at the last election only by the BNP. The last time the policy was accepted by a mainstream party was in 1970, when it was a cause of the Tory MP Enoch Powell and featured in his party's manifesto.\par \par \uc2 Helmer has previously provoked controversy for defending those who find homosexuality "distasteful, if not viscerally repugnant". He has also been criticised for suggesting women should bear some responsibility for date rape in certain circumstances.\par \par \uc2 The emergence of his comments on voluntary repatriation will inevitably raise fresh questions about Farage's party after a series of council election candidates were exposed for holding racist or Islamophobic views. On Friday, Farage's spin doctor attempted to halt a live radio interview as the Ukip leader struggled with questions over Romanian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In his book, A Declaration of Independence, Helmer wrote: "I was surprised by the vehemence with which some party spokesmen attacked the concept of voluntary repatriation. It was described in the most intemperate language - 'abhorrent' was one of the milder words used. I have even seen the idea of voluntary repatriation compared to ethnic cleansing. This is a lunatic comparison."\par \par \uc2 In an interview with the Observer, Helmer also admitted that while those in the public eye are "obliged to take care with the sort of language we use", he "would be extremely upset if the BBC fired" Jeremy Clarkson, following the emergence of a Top Gear outtake in which the presenter was heard to use a racially offensive term.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140519ea5i00025\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer Home News Pages\par \b \uc2 Front: MPs to probe \uc2 Serco\uc2  over sex assault claim at asylum centre: Firm forced to reveal incident report: Vaz 'shocked' by Yarl's Wood events\b0\par\par\uc2 by Mark Townsend, Home Affairs Editor   \par \uc2 1,016 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Serco\uc2 , the private outsourcing giant, is to be investigated by MPs after it was forced to disclose a secret internal report revealing evidence that it failed to properly investigate a claim of repeated sexual assaults by one of its staff against a female resident at Yarl's Wood \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  detention centre.\par \par \uc2 The document, which was marked confidential, was made public last week following a four-month legal battle between \uc2 Serco\uc2  and Guardian News and Media. Lawyers said the report demonstrates a culture of disbelief towards women inside the detention centre, which is run by \uc2 Serco\uc2 , and hailed the high court's decision forcing \uc2 Serco\uc2  to disclose the document as a victory for greater transparency.\par \par \uc2 The revelation comes a day after it was disclosed that \uc2 Serco\uc2  could be among companies to take over the running of privatised children's social services, including child protection, under proposals being considered by Michael Gove's Department for Education.\par \par \uc2 Keith Vaz\uc2 , chair of the home affairs select committee, said the report's revelations were "shocking" and warned he would be summoning senior \uc2 Serco\uc2  figures to parliament next month for them to explain their actions.\par \par \uc2 The report details an investigation into the claims of a 29-year-old woman from Pakistan that she was sexually assaulted three times at Yarl's Wood by a \uc2 Serco\uc2  health worker between November 2010 and January 2011.\par \par \uc2 Although the claims of Sana (not her real name) remain unsubstantiated after investigations by police and the Home Office, the report's findings and process have angered MPs and lawyers.\par \par \uc2 Among them is the revelation that a \uc2 Serco\uc2  guard who appeared to believe the claims made by the alleged victim be given "guidance" to assist her "objectivity" in future, and that \uc2 Serco\uc2  believed the alleged victim lacked credibility because her allegations were deemed too consistent and detailed.\par \par \uc2 Vaz said: "These are shocking revelations and they demonstrate to me that an internal investigation is not enough. It's clearly the tip of the iceberg as far as these allegations are concerned and the way \uc2 Serco\uc2  has dealt with them.\par \par \uc2 "There needs to be an external examination following these revelations, which will look at the entire history of the allegations but also look carefully at the way in which \uc2 Serco\uc2  manage other properties of this kind.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Serco\uc2  will need to appear before the committee at our next inquiry looking at the whole procurement process, which we will be conducting very shortly."\par \par \uc2 The Labour MP said that until he felt all the information on the issue had been collated, \uc2 Serco\uc2  should be prevented from bidding for fresh contracts.\par \par \uc2 "We should not be giving out contracts to companies who have let the country down," he said. "This is clearly a case where there are serious questions that remain to be answered."\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, pressure mounted on the government to adequately scrutinise the ability of private companies to look after vulnerable individuals. Rashida Majoo, the United Nations special rapporteur into violence against women who was banned by the Home Office from entering Yarl's Wood last month, said that the new material would be examined and potentially forwarded to other groups, including the UN special rapporteur on torture.\par \par \uc2 The developments will intensify concern over the outsourcing of contracts to look after some of the most needy people in society. Yesterday the Guardian revealed plans by Gove's department to consider outsourcing child protection services to companies such as \uc2 Serco\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Experts and lawyers said that the contents of the internal report had prompted fresh alarm over whether \uc2 Serco\uc2  could be trusted to handle such complex issues.\par \par \uc2 Former director of public prosecutions Ken Macdonald QC said that when commercial organisations are given the right to run state contracts for profit, "it is essential that they show they are capable of acting in the public interest. Here, the suggestion is that in the face of credible allegations that a member of their staff had committed repeated sexual assaults on an especially vulnerable inmate, \uc2 Serco\uc2  conducted an inadequate investigation in secret and then did everything they could to hide their findings from the public."\par \par \uc2 Harriet Wistrich, the lawyer representing Sana, said: "The failure of the investigatory process affects not only the complainant but all women detained at Yarl's Wood, since it allows abuse to continue and thrive."\par \par \uc2 Serco\uc2 's report says:\par \par \uc2 \u9632\'25\'A0 The company believes that the female detention officer who believed Sana's account should "be given advice and guidance to assist her in being more objective in the future. She should not be making judgments without knowing all the facts."\par \par \uc2 \u9632\'25\'A0 The same guard "appears to have believed the allegations without considering the possibility that they have been fabricated."\par \par \uc2 \u9632\'25\'A0 \uc2 Serco\uc2  investigators concluded it was possible that Sana "is being advised by her solicitor and befriender of actions to take in order to thwart her removal directions".\par \par \uc2 \u9632\'25\'A0 Comments made by an investigating police officer suggest [Sana's] answers were "very clinical and she didn't appear distressed".\par \par \uc2 \u9632\'25\'A0 The alleged perpetrator is a "family man with strong religious beliefs and would have a lot to lose".\par \par \uc2 \u9632\'25\'A0 It is possible that Sana "manipulated the situation in order to put [alleged perpetrator] in a position where she could make an allegation".\par \par \uc2 Norman Abusin, \uc2 Serco\uc2 's director at Yarl's Wood, said: "Sexual contact between residents and staff is always completely unacceptable. We view any complaint of this type of behaviour extremely seriously and have strict procedures for dealing with any such complaints: they are always investigated and the necessary disciplinary action is always taken, including informing the relevant authorities.\par \par \uc2 "Our managers and staff work hard to establish and maintain good relationships with the residents. The most recent HM chief inspector of prisons inspection report, issued in October 2013, considered it to be an establishment where residents feel safe and there is little violence.\par \par \uc2 "However, we are not complacent and make continuous improvements to the services we provide."\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140519ea5i00021\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer In Focus Pages\par \b \uc2 In Focus: With Tory spirits rising, is an outright general election victory in sight?: They may be facing a drubbing from Ukip in the European elections and Labour at a local level, but despite lingering doubts about the economic recovery, there are clear signs that self-belief is back on the Conservative benches. Toby Helm and Lucy Fisher ask whether the political tide really is turning blue\b0\par\par\uc2 Toby Helm, Lucy Fisher and Tony Travers   \par \uc2 2,181 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 28\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The fish and chip kiosks are doing brisk business and the beach huts along Paignton seafront have been spruced up with a lick of paint. On this stretch of Devon coast - known as the English Riviera - things are beginning, tentatively, to look up. Just along the coast in Torquay the faded grandeur is being slowly reclaimed as tourists arrive and the high summer season approaches. A five-star hotel resort is about to be developed in the town that inspired Fawlty Towers\par \par \uc2 At the last general election Torbay constituency, which takes in Torquay and Paignton, went to the Liberal Democrats with a majority over the Conservatives of more than 4,000. Now, with the economy improving, the Tories have this seat, like many other marginals held by the Lib Dems and Labour, firmly in their sights.\par \par \uc2 Maria Savva, 35, and her fiance Andy Carlton, 41, own a high-street cafe and used to vote Labour but will go for the Tories next May. They give credit to the Tory leader \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , rather than the Lib Dems' Nick Clegg, for raising tax thresholds (although it was a Lib Dem idea) and are grateful that the Help to Buy scheme allowed them to get on the housing ladder.\par \par \uc2 "The Conservatives are helping to raise the tax thresholds and sort out business rates - as a small shop, we are now exempt, which is obviously helpful for us," Savva said. Carlton added: "They have also helped us buy our first property. The way the country's being run has worked in our favour."\par \par \uc2 It is by no means all plain sailing for the Tories in Torbay, however. Shop manager Simon Radmore, 35, thinks that Ukip could still split the Tory vote and let the Lib Dems back in. "I've always voted Conservative, but I think they're going to find it difficult. Ukip have got their claws in here and will steal votes from the Conservatives because of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 But, after months in which Tory strategists have fretted about when, and if, the economic recovery would register with the public, there are signs that at last it may be doing so in some pockets of the country, and that the Conservatives rather than the Lib Dems are getting the credit. Certainly Tory MPs at Westminster were in far better spirits last week.\par \par \uc2 "The mood is miles better than a few weeks ago," said a senior backbencher as he prepared to head off on to the local and European election campaign trail. "Nothing like a couple of good opinion polls and good economic news to turn things round!"\par \par \uc2 It is very early days to talk of a sustained Tory surge, particularly ahead of this week's elections. The Conservatives are resigned to coming third behind Nigel Farage's Ukip and Labour in the European poll, and could lose as many as 10 or 11 of their 26 seats in the EU parliament if their share of the vote drops below 20% from the 27.7% the party polled in 2009.\par \par \uc2 Ukip, meanwhile, could more than double its number of seats, from 13 in 2009 to 27. The Tories are also expected to lose somewhere between 100 and 250 council seats, with Labour making solid gains.\par \par \uc2 But most Conservatives have factored in this week's setbacks and are looking ahead. "We will take a big hit, sure," says another Tory MP. "These elections will not tell us much about what will happen next May. This will be Ukip's high water mark. From now on it will be about the economy and leadership: Cameron versus Miliband."\par \par \uc2 Tory confidence is growing. Last week two opinion polls put the Conservatives ahead of Labour, the first time this had happened for two years. A survey for the billionaire Tory peer Lord Ashcroft showed the Conservatives on 34%, Labour on 32%, Ukip on 15% and the Lib Dems on 9%, while a Guardian/ICM poll had the Tories on 33%, Labour on 31%, Ukip on 15% and the Lib Dems on 13%.\par \par \uc2 The latest employment and economic figures also stoked rediscovered Tory self-belief. The number of people out of work in the UK fell by 133,000 to a five-year low of 2.2 million in the three months to March. And the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  announced the jobless rate had fallen to a five-year low of 6.8%. Although much of the rise in employment was accounted for by a rise in self-employment, the number claiming jobseeker's allowance in April fell by 25,100 to 1.12 million, and the total of unemployed 16- to 24-year-olds was down by 48,000 to 868,000.\par \par \uc2 At prime minister's questions on Wednesday, the sheer relief at the poll movement and abundance of good economic news fostered a mood of such elation on the Tory benches that, afterwards, it worried some Conservative MPs. "We do have to be really careful that we don't look like we have already won," said one.\par \par \uc2 In marginal seats across the country, there is progress for the Tories, but it is still uncertain. In another of their target seats, Birmingham Northfield, Labour MP Richard Burden has seen his majority decline since 2001. He won a majority of just over 2,700 votes in 2010 and the Conservatives hope to take it next year.\par \par \uc2 Rebecca Fothergill, 35, a communications manager, recently bought a new-build house on the Rednal estate. A swing voter, she was warming to the Tories: "There have been fantastic changes since the coalition came in, in terms of benefits changes and in terms of tax - positive changes to recognise parents working and childcare. There also seem more jobs for students leaving university than there were a few years ago. Around here, in terms of regeneration, it does feel like things are prospering." But Harjimder Sandhu, 50, a first-generation \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  from Punjab, India, who owns a fish and chip shop, said: "I can feel the economy is rising this year, more people are coming into the shop. But the economy of living is still very hard. I haven't raised prices in two years, and my profit is going down as food, especially, is more expensive. My staff are struggling to pay their bills. People can't afford to do a weekly shop at the supermarket. I will continue to vote Labour."\par \par \uc2 For Cameron's party the signs are good, but they have by no means sealed the deal with the electorate. Tory strategists know that the economy is vital, but discipline will also be key. The cohesion of the coalition will be difficult to maintain but will, to some extent, be beyond their control. The year-long run to the general election, with little legislation in the pipeline to occupy the governing parties, will create a void in which Conservatives and Lib Dems will go their own ways in the name of "differentiation". There is talk of the Lib Dems pondering not just "aggressive de-coupling" but a "nuclear option" well before next May, in which they would break the coalition over a particular issue, to assert their identity and independence. The kind of ugly argument that broke out again last week between the Tories and Lib Dems over free schools, if repeated on other fronts, could test voters' patience.\par \par \uc2 The big question now is whether the Tories can continue to make sufficient progress in the polls to a point where they can win more seats than Labour at the general election or even win an overall majority. It remains a giant task, one that most experts believe is beyond them. Tony Travers of the London School of Economics, like many experts, doubts that the Conservatives will increase their share of the vote by a sufficient amount to be able to rule on their own, even if the economy continues upwards. "The Tories are unlikely to better the 36% vote share they achieved in 2010," he says. "Labour would have to drop to 30% or below to make a Conservative majority possible."\par \par \uc2 In 2010, positioned on the centre ground under Cameron the moderniser, they were fighting a discredited post-crash Labour government led by a very unpopular \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  and still failed to do well enough to rule on their own. The way the electoral system favours Labour means a tie in the vote share would leave Ed Miliband's party well ahead in the tally of seats and in a good position to form a coalition with the Lib Dems. Hence the enthusiasm of some in the opposition for a core vote strategy aimed at winning just 35% of the vote. A 35:35 tie with the Tories would almost certainly put Miliband in Downing Street. If analysts agree the Tories have a mountain to climb, they also agree that general predictions this time around are riddled with uncertainty. The rise of Ukip, the fall in support for the Lib Dems, and September's referendum on Scottish independence have built in huge unknowns. Even if the economy keeps growing and house prices continue to soar, danger lurks. Some economists are already saying that the Bank of England should be preparing people for a rise in rates sooner rather than later.\par \par \uc2 "A sudden and unexpected slowdown in the UK economy could be a problem for \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 ," says Travers. "No one knows how well grounded the recovery is. Uncertainty is the only certainty." Labour is certainly unnerved by signs that the polls are narrowing and is consumed by indecision over policy. MPs complain there is not enough to talk about on the doorsteps, and that what policy there is can be too technical to explain simply.\par \par \uc2 One former Labour minister said: "It is fine saying we will freeze energy prices, but voters are not stupid. They want to know how that would happen, and it is difficult to convince them how we will actually do it."\par \par \uc2 European polls last night showed contrasting intentions. An ICM poll showed Labour in first place on 29%, down one point from last month, with the Tories up four points to 26% and Ukip dropping two to 25%. However, a ComRes survey put Ukip in front on 35%, up one point on last week, with Labour unchanged on 24% and the Tories down two points to 20%.\par \par \uc2 Debate still rages between those senior Labour figures wanting to make bold policy announcements, such as a new tax to fund the \uc2 NHS\uc2  or the renationalisation of rail, and those who urge caution. Last week Labour's new signing from the US, David Axelrod, former adviser to Barack Obama, spoke to members of the shadow cabinet and party officials and had dinner with Miliband and his wife. As well as giving strategic advice, some believe his main contribution may be to lift the party out of inertia and self-doubt.\par \par \uc2 Axelrod believes that the "biggest risk is taking no risk at all", and said Labour had to connect with people "who feel left out of politics and economics" with messages that voters really believe will affect their lives.\par \par \uc2 Campaigning in Crawley yesterday, Miliband took up the theme, saying that "people wonder whether the problems aren't just too big and politics too small. I say to people today: the problems are big, but we can rise to the challenge." The mood has swung in the last week, and so have polls, but not so much that anyone serious would dare to call the outcome of the general election 2015.\par \par \uc2 TORY TAKEOVER?\par \par \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  won just 36.1% of the vote in 2010 and on the basis of elections since 1974 the Conservatives' vote share is likely to be lower in May 2015 than in 2010. But 36.1% was not sufficient to win a majority. If the Conservatives were to get close to 36%, then to win they would require Labour to decline to 29% or 30% by polling day. Professor Stephen Fisher at Oxford has\par \par \uc2 forecast, on the basis of past voter behaviour, that something of this kind might occur. Forecasting election outcomes is not as easy as it once was. No one can predict how former Lib Dem and current Ukip protest voters will distribute themselves.\par \par \uc2 It looks ever more likely that no party will win the coming election outright. But \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  could remain prime minister.\par \par \uc2 Tony Travers,\par \par \uc2 London School of Economics\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 The signs are good for \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and his party, but they know that they have by no means sealed the deal with the electorate.

\par\par \uc2 Observer New Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: Ukip's running scared - all it takes is a good argument\b0\par\par\uc2 Nick Cohen   \par \uc2 1,095 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 39\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 'Political correctness" is a treacherous ideology, which can turn you upside down. I avoid the term if I can because it has a double meaning. On the one hand, it describes a liberal and in my view admirable campaign to persuade institutions and the wider population to treat people equally regardless of gender, colour or sexual orientation. Like all campaigns in democracies, it can win only by winning arguments.\par \par \uc2 But political correctness has become a despised term because it also means the silencing of arguments. Liberal authoritarians, a description that would once have been oxymoronic, have trampled down the boundary that allowed the law to punish speech only if it directly inspired violence - a racist speaker urging a crowd to attack a mosque, a religious fanatic calling for the murder of gay people.\par \par \uc2 Instead of engaging in unrestrained argument against opponents who threaten no violence, they demand that the police arrest them, that universities ban them, or that employers fire them, as happened with a Christian, Adrian Smith, who, after posting his opposition to gay marriage, was sacked by Trafford Housing Trust.\par \par \uc2 Matthew Goodwin, the co-author of a recent study of Ukip, said the radical right was triumphing because it could pose as an honest spokesman for popular concerns. Forty per cent of working-class voters thought they had no representation in politics, he said, a figure that should terrify the British left. They saw Farage as a liberator because he allowed people to speak their minds.\par \par \uc2 Or some people. Last weekend, Cambridge police sent two officers to the home of Michael Abberton to accuse him of posting a politically incorrect tweet. After thinking that the Home Office had not cut the Cambridgeshire constabulary's budget hard enough, if it could afford to waste public money harassing free citizens, I took a deep breath and wondered what "crime" Abberton had committed. Real or imagined homophobia, racism or sexism, that had harmed no one? It had to be one of the above. No, it was a satirical mock-up of a Ukip poster, of the type people tweet every day.\par \par \uc2 The officers told him to take the tweet down, he said, and to make sure he told no one about their sinister visit either. Like a true free-born Briton, Abberton refused. After the coppers left, he wondered how the police had found his address, when it is not on his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  profile, and why they had come to his home on a Saturday afternoon and threatened him, just because his tweet had offended a Ukip councillor.\par \par \uc2 "This is not 1930s Germany," Cambridgeshire police said as it sought to explain away its intimidation. This was hardly reassuring. If police officers use the "at least we're not as bad as Hitler" defence, every abuse short of starting a world war becomes permissible\par \par \uc2 And Ukip will encourage the abuses. The Abberton case shows the supposed defenders of plain-speaking common sense are more than willing to call 999 to silence their critics. The worst of the right goes on to imitate the worst of the left in echoing the self-pitying cry that it is a victim of a vast elite conspiracy.\par \par \uc2 Except this time the conspiracy is not patriarchy or neoliberberalism but anyone who engages in the vigorous debate. (You can witness what happens to Farage when properly cross-examined, as he was last week by James O'Brien on LBC.)\par \par \uc2 Farage began the sob story when he announced that the media had whipped up a "storm of hatred" against Ukip. By "whip up", he meant that a free press had examined the lavish expense claims of Ukip politicians and told the electorate about their political views. Farage moved on to say that his opponents in Unite Against Fascism and Hope not Hate were Labour-led, taxpayer-funded organisations that were threatening him with violence. He was a persecuted dissident: a modern Mandela in a blazer and cords. Farage did not mention that Unite Against Fascism is a tiny group run by the Socialist Workers party. Hardly anyone on the far left, let alone the rest of British society, has associated with it ever since women members revealed how the party hushed up their accusations that SWP commissars had raped them.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, far from being a gang of thugs, Hope Against Hate is an inspirational organisation. It's never been violent. It is not Labour-led. How could it be? Until recently, Ed Miliband has ducked a confrontation with Ukip and wastes his time deriding Nick Clegg, who, for all his faults, at least knows that Farage must be fought. Most of Hope Not Hate's supporters are from the left, but it works with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.\par \par \uc2 In the days when Farage seemed more anti-EU than anti-\b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , Ukip said it was happy to work with it too and discuss how to spot far-right infiltrators. Nick Lowles, founder of Hope Not Hate, tells me he knew that Ukip was going wrong when the party's then chief executive failed to show up at a meeting.\par \par \uc2 It's not what Hope Not Hate does but how it does it that matters. It does not say Ukip is a fascist party. It does not damn all Ukip supporters as racists. Rather, it goes on to the streets and argues. By the time of the election, thousands of supporters will have delivered eight-page newspapers to several million homes.\par \par \uc2 Their articles talk in a straightforward English that the academic left cannot master about how unscrupulous parties use hatred of foreigners to divert attention from the need for higher wages and better jobs.\par \par \uc2 Certainly, they mention the Ukip politicians who dine long and well at public expense and their attitudes to women, black people and gay people. But that is democratic politics, not a police matter, and if Farage cannot handle democratic politics, he should seek a less demanding trade.\par \par \uc2 That so many on left and right want to punish opponents tells us one of two things. It may be that the British think that argument is too weak a means to express their righteous disapproval and only punishment can satiate their fury. In which case, they do not know that argument can be strong, unconstrained, as vulgar as you want, and devastating. Or it may be that large sections of British society no longer know how to argue and banning is all they can do.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140519ea5i00019\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer New Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 Comment: EUROPEAN ELECTIONS: Let's not forget what Europe has achieved\b0\par\par\uc2 Observer editorial   \par \uc2 1,152 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 36\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 This Thursday's European elections could prove a resounding success for Nigel Farage and for populist anti-EU parties across Europe, wheeling a Trojan horse directly into the heart of Brussels, boosting a rightwing Europe-wide coalition, intent on destroying that first promise of the Treaty of Rome: "To lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe." In Britain, Farage, MEP for the south-east of England, argues that the EU is a failed project, based on a failed currency system that is sucking the life out of many of its members and impinging on the British way of life with its policy of "open door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ". "By leaving and prospering, we can strike a decisive blow against those who are determined to create a superstate," Farage has argued repeatedly.\par \par \uc2 According to a recent YouGov poll , Ukip could receive an unprecedented 31% of the vote, the first time an outsider party in the UK has a won a national election for 100 years. After recession, stagnation and social unrest, just at the point when the eurozone is showing fragile signs of recovery, the European project has never appeared sicklier, more frail. A consensus exists that the EU is a vastly overblown technocratic monolith that eats cash and benefits few. While the voices of the arch Eurosceptics such as Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Front, and the views of anti-federalists, including David Cameron, promising an in-out referendum in 2017, are loudly heard, supporters of the original ideal, to create a major bloc to tackle egregious challenges such as climate change and globalisation, and to encourage "competition to stimulate, co-operation to strengthen and solidarity to unite", have been drowned out. Champions of the European ideal are in desperately short supply. So how has it to come to this? And what is in danger of being lost in the process?\par \par \uc2 The first 50 years of the 20th century for Europe were those of economic blight, war and the loss of generations of young men. In 1951, six countries in Europe, came together to form the European Coal and Steel Community, "a first step in the federation of Europe", soon followed by the European Economic Community, the common market.\par \par \uc2 As sociologist Hannah Arendt pointed out, after two world wars, the endeavour offered "pardon and promise". Jacques Delors said Europe had a choice: "Unify or decline." Over the following decades, as the numbers of countries involved in the EU has increased to the current 28, incorporating 500 million citizens, 20% of global purchasing power, the challenge has grown ever more complex.\par \par \uc2 How to balance national sovereignty against the drive to centralise and how to retain a cultural identity under the impact of open borders and "the free movement of people, goods, services and capital"? Fears about German hegemony and voters' accelerating dislike of the EU's lack of accountability and transparency, and the direction of travel for the whole enterprise, has turned into mistrust. That mistrust turned to open hostility when the banks collapsed in 2008. Immense hardship hit countries such as the UK, Spain, Portugal and Italy - still facing huge cutbacks and appalling levels of youth unemployment. Instead of writing down debts, for instance, in Greece, taxpayers' money went to the banks, and swingeing cuts meant consumers had even less in their pockets. Far from equalising life chances and socialising risk, the most vulnerable had even less while the insulated cartel of EU technocrats appeared immune.\par \par \uc2 In the UK, the fight for jobs, the relative ease with which benefits can be obtained, such as child benefit, compared with welfare systems in eastern Europe, have all added to the conviction that, as Cameron rightly says, the terms of engagement need an overhaul. Even the EU's outgoing president, \uc2 Jose Manuel Barroso\uc2 , is said to believe, the EU's institutions are dysfunctional and not democratic enough. His former adviser, Phillipe Legrain, agrees. "To save the EU," he says. "We need to fix it." So what needs to be done?\par \par \uc2 In 2012, Britain contributed pounds 8bn to the EU or one penny in every taxpayer's pound. Examples of the apparent profligacy of the EU aren't difficult to find - not least in the lack of rigour in accounting and the generosity of MEPs allowances. Then there are the pet projects; pounds 8bn was spent on the A3 in Italy, under construction for 50 years as a result of Mafia interest. But EU redevelopment funding has also splendidly remodelled Birmingham city centre (pounds 6m), and invested pounds 4bn in Wales. On the plus side, the EU takes half of all the UK's exported goods. It supports more than 3 million jobs in Britain and half of those doing business with us say that our membership of the EU is an important factor. Outside the EU, competing with India and China, subjecting our British-made cars, for instance, to a 10% import tax, prospects would be grimmer.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the EU's directives have immeasurably improved lives in areas such as human rights, equal pay, sex discrimination and parental and part-time workers' entitlements. The EU's report card is, however, mixed. "Could do better" is certainly a theme.\par \par \uc2 In the short term, the elections for the European parliament have little life. Poll after poll shows that voters say they believe they have no voice. Reasons for optimism exist. A poll this month of seven EU nations, including the UK, by Pew Research, shows that after a dramatic decline in the wake of the EU crisis, faith in one of the EU's funding principles - that European economic integration is good for the country - is up 15 points in the UK from a low of 26% last year to 41% now, the largest increase of the seven. Again, in the UK in 2013, 43% were in favour of the EU. Now, in spite of Farage fever, that figure has risen to 52%.\par \par \uc2 Obviously, the fight for the EU is about more than rhetoric. Jobs and significant investment in education, business and innovation are vital if the EU is to flourish. The banking system needs restructuring so lending to business flows again. The conflicting needs of those 18 countries inside the Euro, and those that remain outside, need resolution. A new model of sovereignty within the EU has to be negotiated and less arrogance shown to the concerns of the electorate. Much of the current negative narrative, however, so hostile to "outsiders", has resurrected the uglier side of populism and nationalism. So, as we enter the polling booth, it's worth reminding ourselves that for more than 70 years, a united Europe has delivered a far better future than the carnage that came before. That ought to count for much.\par \par \uc2 Document OB00000020140519ea5i00013\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw214\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3210\pichgoal525

\par\par \uc2 Observer New Comment Pages\par \b \uc2 THE OBSERVER PROFILE: Caroline Aherne: Reclusive comic superstar with a big heart: The Royle Family star quit TV at the height of her fame. But now she's back in the public eye, offering her support for a new cancer campaign and disclosing her own illness.\b0\par\par\uc2 Tim Lewis   \par \uc2 1,718 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Observer\par \uc2 OB\par 34\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2014.  The Observer.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In 1999, Caroline Aherne, then at the peak of her powers, following a triumphant first run of The Royle Family, met a young comedian, David Walliams. They flirted at the Groucho Club, lying side by side on the snooker table, before going back to Aherne's house in Notting Hill for more drinks. There, as Elvis crooned in the background, she gave Walliams some advice: "Whatever you do, don't lose your anonymity. It's the most terrible thing to lose."\par \par \uc2 No one can doubt that Aherne meant it. In 2001, after three impeccable series of The Royle Family, she announced she was quitting television, aged 37. (She chose, in either a curious, or ingeniously meta, touch, to use Hello! as the organ to make this revelation.) She left for Australia, came back to the UK and, in 2006, sold up in London and moved to the south Manchester suburb of Timperley, where she lives round the corner from her mum, Maureen, and brother, Patrick.\par \par \uc2 Aherne's sardonic narration can be heard on Channel 4's Gogglebox, but, in contrast to Walliams, she has practically disappeared from view this past decade.\par \par \uc2 The 50-year-old Aherne's return to the headlines is not a cause for celebration. Sadly, it is not because of a new television show - though she is said to have been writing again with her regular collaborator, Craig Cash. Instead, it emerged that she is recovering from chemotherapy for lung cancer. The condition was diagnosed at the end of last year and is understood to be hereditary. This is the third time she has had to deal with cancer, having had retinoblastoma, a sight defect, as a baby and also bladder cancer.\par \par \uc2 With Aherne's aversion to publicity, her decision to speak at an event in Manchester on 26 June, organised by all the cancer-care providers in the city, is a significant one. Her reasons were both personal and philanthropic. "I've had cancer and my brother's had cancer and we know how it affects people," she said for the launch of the initiative. "It's truly shocking to learn that Manchester came bottom out of 150 areas in England for premature deaths from cancer. Our survival rates are 25% lower than the national average and the number of people getting lung cancer is a third higher."\par \par \uc2 There has been some discussion in recent times, notably around the deaths of American actors James Gandolfini and Philip Seymour Hoffman, of our tendency to grieve over the travails of celebrities - essentially strangers. Perhaps we are mourning the loss of an irreplaceable talent. Maybe, some speculate loftily, we are preparing for when we have to go through similar emotional upheavals ourselves.\par \par \uc2 News of Aherne's illness, however, has provoked a particularly heartfelt emotional outpouring - yes, on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , but also in the real world. Again, part of this is down to the fondness that people feel towards her work, first as the faux-naive chatshow host Mrs Merton, and then in her portrayal of Denise, the self-absorbed but surprisingly likable daughter in The Royle Family\par \par \uc2 More than that, though, was the spirit of those programmes, both of which she wrote with Cash and Henry Normal. Although clearly tack-sharp - she has an IQ of 176 - the comedy of The Royle Family, in particular, is tender and often very moving. "She loved the daftness of people," noted Walliams, who had a turbulent, year-long relationship with Aherne, in the book Inside Little Britain. "So she would watch Trisha and point out the silly things people said but her observations were affectionate. Full of warmth. There was no intellectual snobbery about her. Or superior class judgment. She is from that world and loves it."\par \par \uc2 Likewise, when she filmed The Mrs Merton Show, which ran for five series from 1995, Aherne insisted that the audience be primarily old ladies, rather than the younger crowd that typically came in for comedy shows. She was adamant that it was not elderly biddies but the celebrities she interviewed, memorably, Debbie McGee, Carol Thatcher and George Best, who should be on the receiving end of "a warm and gentle kicking".\par \par \uc2 For the feature-length documentary The Royle Family: Behind the Sofa, Aherne and Cash gave a rare insight into their writing process. Cash would turn up at Aherne's house and they'd watch Jeremy Kyle. They would then deconstruct The X Factor or whatever had been on TV the previous evening, which would keep them busy until Loose Women. Chips and gravy for lunch and if they wrote one decent line they might take the rest of the day off.\par \par \uc2 "It's just such a good quality, laziness," said Aherne. "It's underestimated. You don't see enough of it on the telly."\par \par \uc2 Much of the material for The Royle Family came from Aherne's own nearest and dearest. Her father, Bert, was an alcoholic and sometimes violent with it. He worked on the railways, died in 1995, and he bequeathed some of his comic grouchiness to Ricky Tomlinson's Jim Royle. Maureen was an Irish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 , too, and the family lived first in London before moving to a council house in Wythenshawe, Manchester, when Aherne was two.\par \par \uc2 Aherne's brother, Patrick, who is 18 months older, also suffered from retinoblastoma. They bickered growing up but have become, she has said, "best of friends". Aherne once asked her brother: "Imagine you met a beautiful woman and she had a gorgeous, perfect body. But no head. How long do you reckon you could go out with her for?" Patrick mulled it over for a few seconds and said: "About a week."\par \par \uc2 Aherne did well at her convent school - nine As in her O-levels - and studied drama at Liverpool Polytechnic. After graduating, she returned to Manchester, working at the pirate radio station KFM. Other DJs included Terry Christian and Jon Ronson, but Aherne made an immediate connection with Cash. The first day they met, she wrote in her diary: "I've just met the funniest man in the world." Everyone at the station was fired in 1990 as KFM went legitimate, so Aherne and Cash decided to develop a comic character she had come up with: an Irish nun called Sister Mary Immaculate. Mrs Merton, initially an agony aunt, followed not long after.\par \par \uc2 When Aherne announced her "retirement" in 2001, she said: "Celebrity is just a game. . . I can't be arsed playing it any more because I've decided I'm no good at it." She was not wrong. In 1994, Aherne married New Order's bassist Peter Hook in a wedding chapel in Las Vegas; two years later they split. She went through a series of intense doomed relationships, which, as her fame increased, began to attract tabloid attention, though, strangely, not her liaison with Walliams, whom she told her mother was a gay friend. Aherne does not have children, though Denise twice became pregnant on The Royle Family. "I can't have babies in real life," she said on the Behind the Sofa documentary. "So it was lovely to write myself in being pregnant."\par \par \uc2 Aherne's drinking was a recurring problem: a bottle of asti spumante was her rider for The Mrs Merton Show. More seriously, in July 1998, she mixed three bottles of champagne with antidepressants; a suicide attempt that ended in a month's rehab at the Priory. "I actually have no recollection of it," she said later. "Finding out what I'd done was like finding out I'd stabbed 15 people. I would never knowingly hurt people in that way."\par \par \uc2 Creatively, at least, Aherne has always known her own mind. At the first read-through for The Royle Family, BBC executives pointed out that not very much happened, there was no beginning, middle or end, and perhaps Aherne might like to make another series of Mrs Merton instead. But she held firm. When the pilot didn't turn out exactly to her liking, she offered to buy it back from the BBC. Aherne has always been relaxed with money - she has been known to hand out pounds 50 or pounds 100 to the homeless - but the fee was pounds 200,000 and the programme aired unchanged.\par \par \uc2 Aherne's move to Australia was prompted in part by her falling out with Cash, but the rift did not last long. And Cash now seems to be the one last link to her previous life. Last week, both John Thomson and Charlie Higson, friends and colleagues of Aherne's from The Fast Show - where the weather was reliably "Scorchio!" - wished her well while at the same time admitting that they had not seen her for three years and a decade respectively.\par \par \uc2 The details we have of Aherne's life now are scarce and random. She doesn't go out much except to a local Italian restaurant. In 2012, she went on holiday to Benidorm with her mother on a Monarch flight. She's given up smoking. Anonymity obviously suited her and we can only be saddened about her reasons for having to give it up.\par \par \uc2 THE AHERNE FILE\par \par \uc2 Born Christmas Eve, 1963, in Ealing, west London.

This is not to say for a moment that all or even most Romanian people living in the UK are criminals.\par \par \uc2 'But it is to say that any normal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door.\par \par \uc2 'So far as I can see most of those media commentators objecting to this statement are people living in million pound houses for whom the prospect of such a turn of events is not a real one.'\par \par \uc2 But it stands in stark contrast to an ICM poll for The Sunday Telegraph, which claims Ukip has dropped into third place behind the Conservatives ahead of this week's elections.\par \par \uc2 It comes as Nick Clegg has claimed that Mr Farage's 'beer-swilling bon ami mask' is slipping to reveal an extremely nasty view of modern Britain.\par \par \uc2 The Deputy Prime Minister accused the Ukip leader of using divisive politics in the LBC interview, and also refused to predict how many euro MPs he expects his party to have after Thursday's elections.\par \par \uc2 He added that Ukip will likely do well and make gains in traditional Labour heartlands.\par \par \uc2 Asked if Mr Farage was 'indulging in racist language' with his Romanian comments, Mr Clegg told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: 'I think the mask is starting to slip and I think what's being revealed that sort of behind the beer-swilling bon ami is a rather nasty view of the world.\par \par \uc2 'I think anyone who singles out one community, one nationality, and says "I don't want to live next door to them", I really think that's the politics of division and I think it really should have no place in modern Britain.\par \par \uc2 'I would say to people if you don't like that point of view, if, like me, you are really put off by this very divisive, nasty approach to things then please go out and vote.\par \par \uc2 'The more people don't vote the more likely it is that Ukip will get in.'\par \par \uc2 The Liberal Democrat leader added he would be happy to debate again with Mr Farage following their recent television clashes, saying: 'I like to think that because I decided to take Nigel Farage on... that's one of the reasons he's being subject to more scrutiny, that's why you're seeing the mask slip and it's revealing an extremely nasty view of modern Britain.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg also accused the Conservatives of stamping their feet and petulance in their attempts to reform the UK's relationship with the \uc2 European Union\uc2  (EU).\par \par \uc2 Prime Minister David Cameron is currently under pressure from allies of German Chancellor Angela Merkel to reveal whom the party's allies will be in the new \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And he has insisted he will not return to Number 10 unless he can secure an agreement that an in/out EU referendum will go ahead in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg said 'you cannot win the argument in Europe unless you are in Europe', saying of the Tory approach: 'I think there's a sort of elevated form of petulance to say we are going to stamp our little feet to get our little short shopping list of really rather minor changes, which they're now advocating, and if we don't get them with them we'll quit.\par \par \uc2 'Guess what happens if you do that? People will say "suit yourself then".'\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg said many of the changes sought by the Tories are 'motherhood and apple pie' that most people would agree with.\par \par \uc2 Asked if it was a 'phoney agenda' from the Tories, he went on: 'I think it's worse than that.\par \par \uc2 'It's never going to satisfy large parts of the Conservative Party because large parts of the Conservative Party actually want to join Nigel Farage and leave.\par \par \uc2 'They don't have the courage to say so, so what you've got is this phoney war if you like within the Conservative Party which is now being papered over, those cracks papered over, by this arbitrary timetable of holding a referendum in 2017.'\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg said he had no problem with a referendum or reforming the UK's relationship with the EU, adding: 'I have a problem with the internal divisions of the Conservative Party being the determining factor of what should be a policy taken in the national interest.'\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Ed Miliband has also spoken out following Mr Farage's controversial interview, saying he believes the politician made some 'deeply offensive' remarks, but is not racist.\par \par \uc2 When asked whether Mr Farage was racist, Mr Miliband told Sky's Dermot Murnaghan: 'Personally, I don't think so.\par \par \uc2 'I think his remarks he made were deeply offensive... I think they were a racial slur but I don't think of Nigel Farage as a racist himself.'\par \par \uc2 UKIP LEADER NIGEL FARAGE'S INTERVIEW WITH LBC'S JAMES O'BRIEN\par \par \uc2 RACE STORMS\par \par \uc2 James O'Brien: 'John Lyndon Sullivan, he's a councillor of yours over in Gloucestershire.\par \par \uc2 'Overnight he's tweeted "I rather often wonder if we shot one poofter, whether the next 99 would decide on balance that they weren't after all. We might then conclude that it's not a matter of genetics, but rather more a matter of education".\par \par \uc2 'A fairly small fry in the UKIP machine, not a description you could apply to your small business spokesman, who it turned out this morning has employed seven illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  in the last year.\par \par \uc2 'Are they both idiots?'\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage: 'Firstly, people say silly things.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 For some time now, I have felt like the only person in the theatre not laughing at the antics of the actors.\par \par \uc2 As much of the nation and my media colleagues were being seduced by the blokeish bonhomie of UKIP leader Nigel Farage, my work as a radio phone-in presenter on LBC had made me question if something uglier lurked behind the cultivated \u8216\'20\'18pint and a fag\u8217\'20\'19 facade.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, with so many people poised to vote for UKIP in Thursday\u8217\'20\'19s elections, I have become increasingly interested in one of the slickest and most dissembling political leaders in memory.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Scroll down for video\par \par \uc2 On Friday I finally got the chance to interview Farage.\par \par \uc2 Why was I disturbed by the surging popularity of a man so many apparently saw as a powerful force for good, a perfect antidote to stagnant and self-serving political debate? Was I mad \u8211\'20\'13 or was he really that bad?\par \par \uc2 It wasn\u8217\'20\'19t just the murky associations, casual bigotry and apparent hypocrisies of the man himself that convinced me; it was the remarkable effect he was clearly having on two types of callers to my daily show.\par \par \uc2 First, people who make no effort to disguise their disdain for foreigners \u8211\'20\'13 long a staple of phone-ins \u8211\'20\'13 seemed emboldened to go beyond the boundaries of what they like to call \u8216\'20\'18political correctness\u8217\'20\'19 but I prefer to think of as good manners.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18You\u8217\'20\'19re not allowed to say what you think any more\u8217\'20\'19 is a popular refrain.\par \par \uc2 It has always confused me, so I generally ask callers to say what it is they think they are not allowed to say. The question is rarely conducive to further conversation.\par \par \uc2 Rightly or wrongly, these people were clearly of the view that Farage was one of their own and whenever the issue of UKIP arose on air, they would be out in force.\par \par \uc2 They also stalk my \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account like so many keyboard terrorists, employing multiple anonymous identities, referencing Nelson or St George and sending seemingly endless tirades of rancour and racist recrimination.\par \par \uc2 Why, I wondered, were so many possessed of truly rancid views drawn to a man generally portrayed so positively?\par \par \uc2 Second, and of much more concern to me, were the callers who could not in a million years be described as racist or bigoted or bad. They were simply scared. And often rather angry.\par \par \uc2 Scared that their homes were going to be overrun by hordes of Bulgarians, scared their children or grandchildren would have no school to go to due to a shortage of places, angry that foreign criminals were not being deported and convinced that \u8216\'20\'18faceless bureaucrats\u8217\'20\'19 in Brussels were ruining their lives.\par \par \uc2 They seemed to see Farage as some sort of saviour and, while he fed their fears and exaggerated their concerns, they became angrier and he more popular.\par \par \uc2 I like these people. They are my friends, my colleagues and ultimately my livelihood.\par \par \uc2 The more I read, the more I heard and the more I learned about Farage, the more they seemed to me to be dancing blindly behind a political Pied Piper.\par \par \uc2 Finally, last Friday morning, in what will probably rank as the most surreal and spectacular studio encounter of my career,\u160\'00\'A0 I got the chance to look into those eyes and work out what really lies beneath. I am not going to forget the experience.\par \par \uc2 It came about after a caller said he was keen to enlist Farage\u8217\'20\'19s help in combating my own frequently expressed fear that the UKIP leader was fomenting racism.\par \par \uc2 With characteristic cool, Farage laughed off the accusations and laid down a \u8216\'20\'18challenge\u8217\'20\'19 to meet me \u8216\'20\'18face to face\u8217\'20\'19 in order to put me straight.\par \par \uc2 I was also, apparently, \u8216\'20\'18a member of the political class and their friends in the media\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 The toothy grin, the relaxed demeanour, the impeccable tailoring and the firm handshake were in evidence immediately. It took mere moments for something less wholesome to appear.\par \par \uc2 That morning it had been reported that UKIP\u8217\'20\'19s small business spokesman, Amjad Bashir, was being investigated for allegedly employing seven illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Farage claimed his man had no involvement\u160\'00\'A0 with the firm. I pointed out he resigned as a director three days after the \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  raid.\par \par \uc2 'The toothy grin, the relaxed demeanour, the impeccable tailoring and the firm handshake were in evidence immediately. It took mere moments for something less wholesome to appear'\par \par \uc2 Next, a listener had forwarded me some comments from a UKIP council candidate in which he spoke of wanting to \u8216\'20\'18shoot\u8217\'20\'19 a \u8216\'20\'18poofter\u8217\'20\'19. Farage promised an investigation. I pointed out the comments had been made in February. He went quiet.\par \par \uc2 When I brought up the subject of his meeting with a particularly repellent resident of the far-Right in 1997, he trotted out the familiar line about the media ignoring the skeletons in other parties\u8217\'20\'19 closets \u8211\'20\'13 so we moved on to people he consorts with at the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Farage is co-president of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group, which includes representatives of far-Right groups such as the Danish People\u8217\'20\'19s Party and the Italian Lega Nord.\par \par \uc2 He explained that I would need a better understanding of European politics to understand why he sits at the helm.\par \par \uc2 Later, the tale of feeling uncomfortable on a train when foreign languages are spoken caused him to squirm.\par \par \uc2 This was due to the simple expedient of pointing out that his own wife and daughters speak \u8216\'20\'18foreign\u8217\'20\'19 and presumably do so in public.\par \par \uc2 So tissue-thin are his principles he attempted to claim that his wife wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t speak German\u160\'00\'A0 \u8216\'20\'18on a train\u8217\'20\'19 before trying to shift the conversation to primary schools. I was happy to follow.\par \par \uc2 It was, though, the Romanians that tipped it over the edge. As he attempted to defend feeling \u8216\'20\'18deeply uncomfortable\u8217\'20\'19 about the prospect of having some live next door, I wondered why it would be any different from having, say, German neighbours.\par \par \uc2 The mask slipped. \u8216\'20\'18You know what the difference is,\u8217\'20\'19 he said, before embarking upon an aside about people-trafficking.\par \par \uc2 I asked about Romanians, he talked about people-traffickers. I asked about Germans, he talked about easily identifiable \u8216\'20\'18difference\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 I have no explanation for this save a conviction on Farage\u8217\'20\'19s part that one\u8217\'20\'19s country of origin or ethnicity determines one\u8217\'20\'19s values and decency.\par \par \uc2 When we moved on to the\u160\'00\'A0 question of his finances, events took an even stranger turn.\par \par \uc2 Asked why he had reverse - ferreted on a pledge to publish his personal accounts, I offered him the transparency agreement employed by every Labour MEP in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He sneered, stumbled, spoke of employing an auditor and finally looked up in shock as communications director Patrick O\u8217\'20\'19Flynn tried to halt proceedings, eventually \u8216\'20\'18helping\u8217\'20\'19 Farage from the studio by those tailored lapels.\par \par \uc2 It was a remarkable conclusion. There is, of course, nothing racist about being concerned\u160\'00\'A0 by \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  levels or Brussels bureaucracy. Just as there is nothing racist about most people tempted to vote UKIP.\par \par \uc2 But when the man who leads the party lets his mask slip briefly, as it did on Friday, it is hardly surprising that people are beginning to ask questions about his convictions.\par \par \uc2 James O\u8217\'20\'19Brien is on LBC radio every weekday from 10am.

\par\par \uc2 Frontpage\par \b \uc2 European elections: Ukip set for landmark win\b0\par\par\uc2 Jane Merrick, John Rentoul, Mark Leftly   \par \uc2 1,702 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par 18:25\par \uc2 Independent Online\par \uc2 INDOP\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Independent Print Ltd. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 'The Sun' calls Nigel Farage racist \u8211\'20\'13 but there seems to be no stopping his party's momentum, as our poll shows. So, Jane Merrick, John Rentoul and Mark Leftly ask, what about the also-rans?\par \par \uc2 Ukip is on course for a landslide victory in this week's European elections, a poll for The Independent on Sunday shows today, as Nigel Farage fiercely denied it was racist to point out "differences" between German and Romanian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader yesterday issued a statement rejecting claims that he was racist in his explosive interview with the radio station LBC, but risked further controversy by declaring that there was a "high level of criminality within the Romanian community in Britain".\par \par \uc2 Today's ComRes poll gives Ukip its highest lead in a European elections survey, suggesting that the Eurosceptic party will scoop up MEP seats across the country. Among those who are certain to vote, Ukip is on 35 per cent, 11 points ahead of Labour, on 24 per cent, with the Conservatives down two points from the last ComRes poll earlier this month, at 20 per cent. The Green Party has pushed the Liberal Democrats into fifth place and is up two points to 7 per cent, while Nick Clegg's party is down two to 6 per cent.\par \par \uc2 But with British Euroscepticism expected to reach its highest ever point this Thursday, David Cameron is under pressure from allies of Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, to reveal with whom the Conservatives will form an alliance in the new \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 . Tory MEPs have been in talks with controversial right-wing parties, including the anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  Danish People's Party and the True Finns, to join their group in Strasbourg because the Tories' existing alliance is on the verge of collapse.\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives set up their group, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) in 2009 after pulling out of the more moderate European People's Party (EPP), to the dismay of Angela Merkel, whose party is in the EPP.\par \par \uc2 Now the leader of the UK branch of the EPP, has written to the Prime Minister saying that voters have a right to know who the Tories would co-operate with in Europe.\par \par \uc2 The ECR could collapse because many of its MEPs face defeat this week, meaning it will fall short of the requirement for members from seven EU countries.\par \par \uc2 The True Finns \u8211\'20\'13 whose leader, Timo Soini, once said "fair \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is an oxymoron" \u8211\'20\'13 and the Danish People's Party \u8211\'20\'13 whose spokesman once likened the Muslim headscarf to the Nazi swastika \u8211\'20\'13 are currently members of Ukip's group.\par \par \uc2 In the letter seen by The IoS, Dirk Hazell, the leader of the 4 Freedoms Party, which is allied to the EPP, tells Mr Cameron: "Has the ECR already secured membership deals with new parties and, if so, with whom? Sadly, British influence has been reduced by your decision to order Conservative MEPs out of the EPP group in 2009." Tory MEP Daniel Hannan held talks with Mr Soini in Helsinki last month, and afterwards said the ECR would be substantially larger after the elections. Another Conservative MEP, Martin Callanan, has revealed that he has spoken to the Danish People's Party's leader, Morten Messerschmidt.\par \par \uc2 The EPP, which includes Mrs Merkel's CDU party as well as centre-right moderates in France, has urged Mr Cameron and his allies to turn away from right-wing Euroscepticism and rejoin their group. Mr Cameron formed the ECR as part of a pledge, made during his attempt to become Conservative party leader in 2005, to win over the right of his party. With the Prime Minister being held to his promise for an in-out referendum after the general election, it is unlikely he will move his MEPs back to the centre.\par \par \uc2 After Mr Farage's interview on LBC on Friday, The Sun \u8211\'20\'13 a newspaper with one of the toughest stances on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 ran an editorial yesterday saying it was "racist" to say there were differences between German and Romanian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . In a statement, Mr Farage said: "Ukip will never allow the false accusation of racism levelled by a politically correct elite to prevent the raising of issues that are of concern to the great majority of the British public \u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 "Police figures are quite clear that there is a high level of criminality within the Romanian community in Britain. This is not to say for a moment that all or even most Romanian people living in the UK are criminals.\par \par \uc2 "But it is to say that any normal and fair- minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door."\par \par \uc2 The IoS/ComRes poll has some good news for the Labour leader Ed Miliband, whose MPs were left troubled by two surveys last week showing a Conservative lead at next year's general election. Voting intentions expressed for 2015 give Labour a four-point lead over the Tories \u8211\'20\'13 33 per cent to 29 per cent \u8211\'20\'13 while Ukip are down one, to 19 per cent, and the Lib Dems are up one point, on 8 per cent.\par \par \uc2 But, despite making a speech last week in which he promised GP appointments within 48 hours, Mr Miliband is struggling for support on the \uc2 National Health Service\uc2  among voters. Nearly half \u8211\'20\'13 47 per cent \u8211\'20\'13 of people do not believe he would deliver on the promise, while just 27 per cent think he would. And only 36 per cent think the \uc2 NHS\uc2  would be safer under Labour than under the current Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition, while nearly as many \u8211\'20\'13 34 per cent \u8211\'20\'13 disagree.\par \par \uc2 Mr Miliband and the Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, also continue to struggle on economic trust, the poll shows, though neither party has much to boast about. While Mr Cameron and his Chancellor, George Osborne, have a net confidence rating on the economy of minus 21 per cent, the Labour pair have a rating of minus 34 per cent.\par \par \uc2 In a speech in Crawley, West Sussex, yesterday, Mr Miliband insisted that Ukip does not have the answer to the problems besetting the country. He said that the only alternative Ukip had to offer to those feeling "deep discontent" was a combination of even deeper cuts than the coalition and higher unemployment, which would be the result of withdrawal from the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "If the question on the ballot paper next Thursday is whether we can turn Britain from a country run for a few at the top to a country run for working people once again, Ukip is not the answer," he said.\par \par \uc2 "They claim to offer something new. But what are their answers? 'Keeping the flame of Thatcherism alive'. Bigger cuts than the Tories. Charges to see your GP. Leave Europe, with all that means for investment and jobs.\par \par \uc2 "Friends, this agenda will never serve the working people of Britain."\par \par \uc2 The green alternative\par \par \uc2 The Green Party could benefit from an "anti-Ukip" vote in this Thursday's elections, its leader, Natalie Bennett says.\par \par \uc2 The Greens have pushed the Liberal Democrats into fifth place in the polls and could treble their number of MEPs if that is replicated in voting this week. Ms Bennett, speaking after touring seats in the North-west on Friday, said many people were saying they had been compelled to turn out and vote to "stop Ukip" because they did not like Nigel Farage's hard-line message.\par \par \uc2 Only a 1.6 per cent swing to the Greens would mean they would increase their tally from two MEPs to six. The party is particularly popular among the young \u8211\'20\'13 although turnout is low among this age group.\par \par \uc2 Ms Bennett claimed that Labour voters in the North-west were switching to Greens, while in the South-west her party was picking up support from Lib Dem voters. In traditional Conservative heartlands, some people were voting Green because of fears about fracking.\par \par \uc2 She told The Independent on Sunday: "This is a PR election, every vote counts. The three large parties are offering business as usual. Politicians really have to change.\par \par \uc2 "There is a definite feeling that the Lib Dems have sold out. With Labour voters, a lot of people are feeling that Labour is so wishy-washy and close to the Tories. On \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , quite a lot of people say they are voting green because of the green-belt issue.\par \par \uc2 "There are people who haven't voted for many years. They are considering voting for us as the anti-Ukip vote. Among the young, we are the only people saying disadvantaged young people should not be paying for the mistakes of the older generation."\par \par \uc2 Ms Bennett agreed with criticism of the "zombie Parliament", which has arisen because the five-year fixed term has left MPs with little to debate or legislate. "It has become very clear that five years is too long." While the Greens have just one MP in Westminster, Caroline Lucas, they are hoping to pick up support on an anti-politics platform from the opposite side of the mainstream to Ukip. Ms Bennett is pushing to take part in the general election TV debates. She said: "We have to be present in the debates if they are to have any credibility."\par \par \uc2 Jane Merrick\par \par \uc2 IoS poll results\par \par \uc2 ComRes tends to record a higher level of support for Ukip in the European election than some pollsters because it assumes that only those who say they are "absolutely certain to vote" \u8211\'20\'13 49 per cent of the sample \u8211\'20\'13 will turn out on Thursday. This compares with a turnout of 34 per cent in the last European election five years ago. Today's 11-point lead for Nigel Farage's party over Labour equals the record lead, also reported by ComRes, at the end of April.\par \par \uc2 One of the reasons for Ukip's level of support is the strength of opposition to free movement of workers in the EU. Only 25 per cent of voters agreed that "all citizens of other \uc2 European Union\uc2  countries should have the right to live and work in the United Kingdom"; 54 per cent disagreed.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140518ea5i001b9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

They've been betrayed, but so has he - his basicinstincts have made a mockery of him.\par \par \uc2 Swedish director Ruben \u214\'00\'D6stlund's last film, Play, presented a bleak,Darwin-esque analysis of high school bullying. In that film a group ofnorth African \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  teens bullied their white classmates. Theadults who witnessed the bullying were too afraid to intervene, forfear of appearing racist. Force Majuere also plays with our obsessionwith being seen to do the right thing. Tomas's responsibilities as a dad should trump his own selfish instinct, but they don't. His disgusted wife, Ebba (Lisa Loven Kongsli), could accept that if Tomas could admit his natural cowardice. But he can't. So he keeps on trying to be proper, while his nature marches the other way. It's a force that can't be stopped. An avalanche that threatens to swamp him, for real this time.\par \par \uc2 \u214\'00\'D6stlund's handling of the avalanche scene is glorious, but it's the centrepiece of a film that is expertly shot throughout. The cinematography, by Fredrik Wenzel and Fred Arne Wergeland, beautifully captures the alien nature of a ski slope - a playground for the affluent classes penned out in the wilds. Imperfections are smoothed out overnight, but the risk of collapse is ever-present. You can see the same in Tomas - the veneer of a handsome, rich family man hides a scared and selfish kid.\par \par \uc2 It's only when \u214\'00\'D6stlund starts to pull his punches that the slow-roll terror of the film comes to a stop. The director heads off the slopes into Lars von Trier territory - drawing out dark comedy from a pair of friends' role as unwitting jury to Tomas's crime. Although Kristofer Hivju puts in a boisterous performance as Tomas's confidante and protector ("You were probably thinking you should be safe so you could come back and dig them out, right Tomas?") the comic relief feels false set against so much stark humanity.\par \par \uc2 \u214\'00\'D6stlund invites us to look at ourselves honestly. He points out our inconsistencies, attempts to holdus to account for our worst hypocrisies. Force Majeure is a frightening film. It brushes off our surface layer, shows us the icy truth underneath.\par \par \uc2 "We survived an avalanche and we were both very frightened," Ebba tells Tomas as they try and rationalise a situation that has no happy resolution. Their kids (brilliant little performances from Clara and Vincent Wettergren) sit side stage as their dad continues to make the story about him. None of them realise Tomas's avalanche has them still. \u214\'00\'D6stlund's sickest joke yet.\par \par \uc2 guardian.co.uk \u169\'00\'A9 Guardian News and Media 2014\par \par \uc2 Document GRULTD0020140518ea5i00105\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Headlines for May 18, 2014 - Housing market 'risk to recovery', 1,000 richest even wealthier than before\b0\par\par\uc2 By liverpoolecho Administrator   \par \uc2 910 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par 14:40\par \uc2 birminghammail.co.uk\par \uc2 EVEMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Trinity Mirror   \par \par \uc2 The latest news from around the world\par \par \uc2 HOME BOOM \u8217\'20\'19MAIN RISK TO RECOVERY\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Britain\u8217\'20\'19s booming housing market represents the \u8221\'20\'1Dbiggest risk\u8221\'20\'1D to the economic recovery, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has warned.\par \par \uc2 With approvals for large mortgages on the increase, Mr Carney expressed concern about the dangers of another \u8221\'20\'1Dbig debt overhang\u8221\'20\'1D building up.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with Sky News\u8217\'20\'19s Murnaghan, to be shown today, he said the Bank was monitoring the situation closely.\par \par \b \uc2 IMMIGRANTS\b0 \uc2  \u8217\'20\'19SHOULD LEARN ENGLISH\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  who come to live in Britain need to learn to speak English and to \u8221\'20\'1Drespect our way of life\u8221\'20\'1D, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and the first Asian Secretary of State, said that people were entitled to expect that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  made a contribution to society.\par \par \uc2 \u8221\'20\'1DPeople want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right,\u8221\'20\'1D he told The Sunday Telegraph.\par \par \uc2 1,000 RICHEST GET MUCH BETTER OFF\par \par \uc2 Britain\u8217\'20\'19s richest people are wealthier than ever before with a combined fortune of \u163\'00\'A3518.975 billion, according to this year\u8217\'20\'19s Sunday Times Rich List.\par \par \uc2 Amid talk of the \u8221\'20\'1Dsqueezed middle\u8221\'20\'1D, the 1,000 richest Britons now own the equivalent of a third of the nation\u8217\'20\'19s gross domestic product (GDP), with their combined wealth rising 15.4% on last year\u8217\'20\'19s total of \u163\'00\'A3449.654 billion.\par \par \uc2 A minimum of \u163\'00\'A385 million is needed to even be considered for the list this year - compared to \u163\'00\'A380 million in 2008 at the height of the pre-crash boom and \u163\'00\'A375 million last year.\par \par \uc2 MILIBAND CRITICISED OVER CAMPAIGN\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband is facing fresh criticism from within the Labour ranks over his \u8221\'20\'1Dsuicidal\u8221\'20\'1D campaign tactics as the party heads into crucial European and local council elections.\par \par \uc2 With one poll last week showing the Tories ahead of Labour for the first time in two years, a series of party figures warned that Mr Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s cautious tactics would not deliver victory in next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election.\par \par \uc2 One prominent backbencher Simon Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale, said they had to stop relying on the unpopularity of the Government and come forward with a positive vision of their own.\par \par \uc2 UKIP ON COURSE TO TOP EURO POLL\par \par \uc2 The UK Independence Party remains on course to top the poll in the European elections while the Liberal Democrats face a humiliating fifth place finish behind the Greens, according to a new opinion poll.\par \par \uc2 The ComRes survey for The Independent on Sunday and the Sunday Mirror puts Ukip out in front with 35% - one point up on last week - among those \u8221\'20\'1Dabsolutely certain\u8221\'20\'1D to vote on Thursday in the election to the Strasbourg Parliament.\par \par \uc2 Labour are unchanged in second place on 24% while support for the Conservatives in third is down two points to 20%.

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Labour MP urges leader to win back Ukip voters and warns 'mantra of misery' is electoral suicide\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband should debate with Nigel Farage and try to woo Ukip voters with \u8220\'20\'1Ctougher\u8221\'20\'1D messages on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and welfare, a Labour MP has said.\par \par \uc2 The Labour leader must \u8220\'20\'1Cget out more\u8221\'20\'1D and talk about aspiration rather than a \u8220\'20\'1Cmantra of misery\u8221\'20\'1D or face defeat at the next election, Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale said in a stinging attack on party\u8217\'20\'19s strategy.\par \par \uc2 It came as Ed Miliband said Mr Farage is not a racist but his views are \u8220\'20\'1Cdeeply offensive\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 And Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the Ukip leader\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cbeer-swilling bonhomie mask\u8221\'20\'1D had slipped to reveal an \u8220\'20\'1Cextremely nasty view of modern Britain.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Labour must recognise Ukip voters are not \u8220\'20\'1Cloons\u8221\'20\'1D but its \u8220\'20\'1Cdespairing\u8221\'20\'1D former voters who need to be won back, Mr Danczuk said.\par \par \uc2 Writing in the Mail on Sunday, he warned Labour needs to \u8220\'20\'1Cup our game\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1Ccome out swinging\u8221\'20\'1D if it is to win the next election. Its leadership treats politics merely as \u8220\'20\'1Can intellectual pursuit\u8221\'20\'1D and has failed to reach out beyond Labour\u8217\'20\'19s core vote of people angered by food banks and the so-called bedroom tax, Mr Danczuk said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe won\u8217\'20\'19t win a General Election by campaigning excessively on food banks and the bedroom tax. Continually reciting a mantra of misery is not the answer. We have to start speaking the language of aspiration.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBritain needs a Government with a convincing mandate to introduce the big changes that are required. But Labour can\u8217\'20\'19t achieve that with the core vote and a few disgruntled Liberals. That\u8217\'20\'19s a suicidal strategy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CUKIP has proved that there\u8217\'20\'19s a rich seam of despairing voters out there. They\u8217\'20\'19ve been ignored for far too long and Labour has to show it\u8217\'20\'19s willing to listen.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s daft to characterise UKIP voters as disaffected loons, because many are simply working-class people tired of the three main parties. A lot are Labour people and we need to work hard to get them back,\u8221\'20\'1D he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Speaking on BBC 5 Live, Mr Danczuk added: \u8220\'20\'1CHe should have probably debated Farage along with Nick Clegg. That would probably have been a smart move in terms of putting Cameron on the back foot. I also think he needs to get out more. He did a piece in the Daily Star where he was playing pool. I think people see Ed at his best when he\u8217\'20\'19s doing that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Clegg accused Nigel Farage of sowing divisive after saying people have the \u8220\'20\'1Cright\u8221\'20\'1D to fear Romanians moving next door to them because \u8220\'20\'1Cthere is a high level of criminality within the Romanian community\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Asked if Mr Farage was "indulging in racist language" with his Romanian comments, Mr Clegg told BBC One's The \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show: "I think the mask is starting to slip and I think what's being revealed that sort of behind the beer-swilling bonhomie is a rather nasty view of the world.\par \par \uc2 "I think anyone who singles out one community, one nationality, and says 'I don't want to live next door to them', I really think that's the politics of division and I think it really should have no place in modern Britain.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Miliband said: \u8220\'20\'1CI think his remarks he made were deeply offensive. I think they were a racial slur but I don't think of Nigel Farage as a racist himself."\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140518ea5i002gx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 Farage not a racist, says under-fire Miliband\b0\par\par\uc2 Sam Coates, Deputy Political Editor   \par \uc2 984 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par 13:41\par \uc2 thetimes.co.uk\par \uc2 TIMEUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband says he does not believe Nigel Farage is a racist despite the Ukip leader\u8217\'20\'19s admission that he would be uncomfortable if a group of Romanians were to move in next door.\par \par \uc2 The Labour leader baffled some party figures today when he sought to make a nuanced judgement about comments by the Ukip leader about Romanians on LBC on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Mr MIliband told Sky News: \u8220\'20\'1CI think his remarks he made were deeply offensive ... I think they were a racial slur but I don\u8217\'20\'19t think of Nigel Farage as a racist himself.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 However, he suggested that he was tempering his language about Mr Farage, whom he has only met once, as part of a deliberate political strategy, adding: \u8220\'20\'1CI have been careful not to characterise [Mr Farage] personally as a racist.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s remark prompted Mark Ferguson, editor of the influential Labour List Blog, to tweet: \u8220\'20\'1CMiliband desperately trying not to call Farage a racist. If it walks like a racist and talks like a racist\u8230\'20\'26\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The equivocation also comes after criticism of the way that Labour has dealt with Ukip in the European elections.\par \par \uc2 Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said it was \u8220\'20\'1Cdaft\u8221\'20\'1D to dismiss voters who were to turning to Ukip as \u8220\'20\'1Cdisaffected loons\u8221\'20\'1D and that winning back support was more than a matter of \u8220\'20\'1Csetting off a few fireworks or coming up with some catchy slogans\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The Labour leader told Sky that Ukip are trying to tap into people\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Csense of discontent\u8221\'20\'1D but said he did not believe Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party had the right solutions.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party could top the poll in Thursday\u8217\'20\'19s elections to the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 . A poll for ComRes put Ukip comfortably on top, while two other polls, one for YouGov and one for ICM, had Labour in front.\par \par \uc2 Labour figures have already started criticising the campaign run by the party, amid fears that a failure to come top will provoke a round of infighting in the party.\par \par \uc2 Mr Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale, said they had to stop relying on the unpopularity of the government and come forward with a positive vision of their own.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ve become too comfortable with talking to ourselves, with policy announced through set-piece speeches as though in a university lecture. Some in the party view politics as an intellectual pursuit; it\u8217\'20\'19s not, it\u8217\'20\'19s a monumental struggle to win hearts and minds,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe won\u8217\'20\'19t win a general election by campaigning excessively on food banks and the bedroom tax. Labour has to offer a route out of poverty and unfulfilled potential.\par \par \uc2 His comments were echoed by Tristan Osborne, the parliamentary candidate for Chatham and Aylesford, one of the party\u8217\'20\'19s key target seats, who was recorded making critical remarks at a Labour fundraising event.\par \par \uc2 In comments reported by the Mail on Sunday and The Sunday Times, he was quoted as complaining of a \u8220\'20\'1Cdodgy campaign\u8221\'20\'1D with \u8220\'20\'1Cno coherent messaging\u8221\'20\'1D, and that \u8220\'20\'1CThe machine is not functioning in any capacity\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Mr Osborne was said to have warned that Mr Miliband would \u8220\'20\'1Cnever form a credible government\u8221\'20\'1D unless he did more to win over \u8220\'20\'1Cthe aspirational southern voter\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe economy is picking up. That reinforces the narrative that they [the Conservatives] are doing well, and there\u8217\'20\'19s absolutely sod all anyone can do about that,\u8221\'20\'1D he was quoted as saying.\par \par \uc2 Nick Clegg went further than Mr Miliband but also stopped short of calling Mr Farage a racist.\par \par \uc2 Asked if Mr Farage was \u8220\'20\'1Cindulging in racist language\u8221\'20\'1D with his Romanian comments, Mr Clegg told The \uc2 Andrew Marr\uc2  Show on BBC One: \u8220\'20\'1CI think the mask is starting to slip and I think what\u8217\'20\'19s being revealed that sort of behind the beer-swilling bonhomie is a rather nasty view of the world.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think anyone who singles out one community, one nationality, and says \u8216\'20\'18I don\u8217\'20\'19t want to live next door to them\u8217\'20\'19, I really think that\u8217\'20\'19s the politics of division and I think it really should have no place in modern Britain.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI would say to people if you don\u8217\'20\'19t like that point of view, if, like me, you are really put off by this very divisive, nasty approach to things then please go out and vote.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe more people don\u8217\'20\'19t vote, the more likely it is that Ukip will get in.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile the Tory culture secretary, who is the son of Pakistani \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and the first Asian secretary of state, said today that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who come to live in Britain need to learn to speak English and to \u8220\'20\'1Crespect our way of life".\par \par \uc2 Sajid Javid, said that people were entitled to expect that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  made a contribution to society.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right,\u8221\'20\'1D he told The Sunday Telegraph.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople also say, when \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  do come to Britain, that they should come to work, and make a contribution and that they should also respect our way of life, and I agree with all of that. It means things like trying to learn English.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 His intervention comes at a time when the Conservatives are under intense pressure from the UK Independence Party over the issue of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  before Thursday\u8217\'20\'19s European elections.\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid criticised those who had failed to assimilate into British society, despite living in the country for many years.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI know people myself, I have met people who have been in Britain for over 50 years and they still can\u8217\'20\'19t speak English,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think it\u8217\'20\'19s perfectly reasonable for British people to say, look, if you\u8217\'20\'19re going to settle in Britain and make it your home, you should learn the language of the country and you should respect its laws and its culture.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140518ea5i0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

It means things like trying to learn English.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid said that there was no place in the English legal system for the practice of Sharia law amid concern that Sharia courts have been established in cities such as London and Birmingham, \u8220\'20\'1CWhere people want to have their own private arrangements between them, that is a matter for them. But there is no place for Sharia law in British law.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8220\'20\'1CPeople want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020140518ea5i000p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw342\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5130\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Sajid Javid, the new Culture Secretary and the first Asian man in the Cabinet, tells Tim Ross that only the Conservatives can change EU law to cut \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \par \par \uc2 Sajid Javid had just landed at Heathrow on a flight from New York on the morning of April 9, and was waiting for his suitcase to trundle around the baggage carousel when he received an urgent message from Downing Street.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister needed to speak to him immediately.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI had just got off the plane,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CI thought, \u8216\'20\'18what\u8217\'20\'19s that about? Have I done something wrong?\u8217\'20\'19\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In fact, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  was calling to invite him to become the first Asian man ever to join the Cabinet.\par \par \uc2 Maria Miller had resigned hours earlier over her expenses and the PM wanted him take her place as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.\par \par \uc2 Six weeks after accepting the job, Mr Javid, 44, is now pitched into the heat of battle, with \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  elections across the UK and polls in 161 English local councils on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The contest is being seen as a dry run for next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election, with all the main parties using Thursday\u8217\'20\'19s polls to \u8220\'20\'1Cstress test\u8221\'20\'1D their campaign machines.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThese are the most important European elections in a generation,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Javid says, on his return to Euston Station after a full day meeting residents in the streets of his Bromsgrove constituency.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s the first time that British people will have a say on Europe since the Eurozone crisis. The vast majority want fundamental change in Europe. They are not happy with the status quo.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 His pitch is that only the Tories can \u8220\'20\'1Cdeliver\u8221\'20\'1D reforms to Britain\u8217\'20\'19s relationship with the rest of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . The Lib Dems and Labour do not want change while the UK Independence Party is not capable of mustering the required support.\par \par \uc2 The Prime Minister, by contrast, has already vetoed one European treaty, cut the EU budget, and pulled Britain out of costly bail out deals which Labour had signed up to, he says.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CImagine what we could achieve if we had more Conservative MEPs in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 , in terms of getting a better deal for Britain and negotiating fundamental reform and putting that in a referendum to the British people.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 So why has Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party soared in popularity, despite the racist pronouncements of some of its candidates and to the cost of the Tories, in recent months?\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani bus driver who came to Britain with just \u163\'00\'A31 in his pocket, suggests that Mr Farage is right to offer a response to legitimate public fears over migration.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen he talks about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , the reason he\u8217\'20\'19s talking about it is that many people throughout Britain are concerned about excessive \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . And they should be,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CPoliticians do need to respond to those concerns.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 It is not good enough for migrants to have lived in the UK for 50 years but still not to be able to speak English, he says.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMy parents were \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from Pakistan. My father has passed away now, but my father and mother were very proud of Britain and they have always respected the country and always wanted to make a contribution.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think that is the story of most \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  I have met - the vast majority.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 What about the rise of Sharia law courts, which have reportedly been established in communities in London, Birmingham, Bradford, Manchester and other areas?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhere people want to have their own private arrangements between them, that is a matter for them,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CBut there is no place for Sharia law in British law.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid grew up in Rochdale and Bristol as one of five brothers, living in a two-bedroom flat above a shop. His father worked hard at two jobs to make ends meet.\par \par \uc2 His rise to the Cabinet has been rapid. A graduate of Exeter University, he was made a vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York aged just 25, and moved on to work at \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 , reportedly earning millions of pounds in the process.\par \par \uc2 He stood for Parliament in 2010 and his story has captured the imagination of many modernising Conservatives, especially those who remember fondly the rise of Baroness Thatcher from grocer\u8217\'20\'19s daughter to Downing Street.\par \par \uc2 After just two years as an MP, he was given a ministerial job in the Treasury before joining the Cabinet last month. Seasoned political commentators have tipped Mr Javid as future Prime Ministerial material.\par \par \uc2 For the moment, though, the father of four has a full in-tray at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\par \par \uc2 Although it was once nicknamed the \u8220\'20\'1CMinistry of Fun\u8221\'20\'1D, the DCMS has been required to handle some of the most controversial policies of the coalition\u8217\'20\'19s four years in power, including same-sex marriage and Press regulation after the phone-hacking scandal.\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid has already been clear that there will be no further government action on regulating the press, which he has defended as \u8220\'20\'1Cthe best in the world\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 As Minister for Equalities, another of his responsibilities, he is equally clear that legalising gay marriage was \u8220\'20\'1Cquite right\u8221\'20\'1D, despite fierce protest from religious groups and an exodus of Conservative grassroots members.\par \par \uc2 At the top of his agenda in the months ahead will be the future of the BBC.\par \par \uc2 Lord Patten, the former Tory Cabinet minister, resigned on health grounds as chair of the BBC Trust and Mr Javid is responsible for recruiting a replacement.\par \par \uc2 But at a time when the BBC is facing allegations of bias, calls to axe the licence fee and a public shocked by failures over the Jimmy Savile scandal, should the Trust itself be abolished when the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s Royal Charter is renewed in 2016?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe have to go through the Charter Review process and decide.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid seems prepared to be radical. \u8220\'20\'1CI think we should look at all the options during that time, as part of the proper formal process.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In a veiled warning to the corporation\u8217\'20\'19s editors, he says he \u8220\'20\'1Cwill take a very close interest in\u8221\'20\'1D the question of whether the BBC is \u8220\'20\'1Cunbiased, in many of ways, not just its news coverage\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Does he agree with 70 per cent of those polled by this newspaper last year, who called for the \u163\'00\'A3145.50 licence fee to be cut or abolished?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI understand when people say the licence fee is a lot of money. For many families \u163\'00\'A3145.50 is a lot of money each year,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe question of what is the best arrangement going forward for the BBC is a question that\u8217\'20\'19s best dealt with in Charter Review.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 His comments on funding for the arts seem to be aimed at reassuring those who feared that a Treasury man would simply want to cut state grants to theatres and galleries.\par \par \uc2 In fact, the taxpayer will always have a role in supporting cultural institutions but the rich should do more, too.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere was a report last week that said London has more billionaires than any other city. Let\u8217\'20\'19s get more of those billionaires giving to the arts sector and the cultural sector that I am sure they value as one of the reasons they live in Britain.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Composed and articulate, despite the frantic political campaigning, Mr Javid seems taken with his new job, although he admits it is \u8220\'20\'1Ca big change\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 While not the largest of departments, the DCMS remit \u8220\'20\'1Ctouches lives\u8221\'20\'1D, such as with Olympics, which \u8220\'20\'1Cchanged Britain and gave our national pride a big boost\u8221\'20\'1D, and other sports events.\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid would clearly pass Norman Tebbit\u8217\'20\'19s famous \u8220\'20\'1Ccricket test\u8221\'20\'1D, having been a keen player and always supported England.\par \par \uc2 In 1990, the former Conservative chairman, now Lord Tebbit, suggested controversially that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and their children could not show loyalty to Britain until they supported the England team at cricket.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CGrowing up in Rochdale I think all the kids in my street, pretty much every boy was playing cricket,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Javid says. \u8220\'20\'1CI had four brothers as well and we played a lot together. When it was just me on my own, I was bowling at a drainpipe.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Did the determined young all-rounder hit his target?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CA bit too much actually, on one occasion.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140517ea5h005ei\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich38\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal570

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 IN THE CORRIDORS OF POWER\b0\par\par\uc2 BY JAMES FORSYTH   \par \uc2 1,151 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Mail on Sunday\par \uc2 MOSM\par 41\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 CAN NIGEL STILL WIN THE EU ELECTION? ASK YOUR POSTMAN\par \par \uc2 THE rest of us are wondering whether that torrid LBC interview, cut off by the intervention of his spin doctor, spells the end for Nigel Farage. But the UKIP leader is already thinking about his next battle.\par \par \uc2 Tonight hell address more than a thousand supporters in Thanet, Kent. Then on Tuesday hell head to Eastleigh in Hampshire for another big public meeting. What connects these two places? They are both on his shortlist of constituencies to stand in come the 2015 General Election.\par \par \uc2 Farage knows that the real challenge for him is to convert the support that UKIP gains at European elections into seats in the Commons. Time and again, UKIP have surged at the European vote only to fall back into irrelevance come the serious business of a General Election.\par \par \uc2 Whether he succeeds will be determined in large part by the result on Sunday night. New parties in Britain are like sharks, if they dont keep moving forward they die. UKIP have to win.\par \par \uc2 The party is acutely aware of that, and its taking its toll.\par \par \uc2 Farages forces are happiest as insurgents and not as front-runners. They fret that they may have peaked too early, that they may have given their enemies one too many chances to shoot them down.\par \par \uc2 Was Farages radio interview on Friday " which managed to be both crude (youd be concerned if Romanians moved in next door to you) and frankly ridiculous (his wife speaks German at home, but wouldnt on the train) " the moment when the UKIP balloon was pricked?\par \par \uc2 But dont write them off yet. What could get them over the line is postal voting. It is expected that 40 per cent of votes will be by mail and many have already cast their ballots. Westminster is certainly bracing itself. Senior figures in all three main parties admit they expect UKIP to win.\par \par \uc2 Ed Milibands team is getting its excuses in early, pointing out that Tony Blair never won one of these elections and that the party is concentrating on the local contests also taking place this week.\par \par \uc2 One Miliband confidant says: The public dont get excited about the European elections unless theres a chance to make a very clear protest vote.\par \par \uc2 But the simple fact is that Labour should be winning. Combine that with polls showing the Tories ahead and it is clear Miliband has a problem. One Shadow Cabinet member even admits he is operating on the assumption the Tories will win a second term.\par \par \uc2 Milibands new guru, David Axelrod, who got Obama elected President, told him last week that UKIPs success was part of the age of alienation. Labour is now attacking UKIP in the way Obama did the Tea Party. The argument is that Milibands policies " not UKIPs anger " will ensure everyone gets a decent shot at life.\par \par \uc2 But UKIP have made inroads into the Labour vote for the first time. Worryingly for Miliband, UKIP think that workers who usually support Labour but who have been won over by UKIPs stance on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  are more likely to stay with them at the General Election than Tories who are using Thursday as a protest against the EU.\par \par \uc2 If Labour dont win this vote, Miliband will enter the most challenging phase of his leadership yet. Last week could have been tricky, with the Tories taking the lead in the polls. But the presence of Axelrod acted as a balm on Labour. However, as one attendee at the Shadow Cabinet meeting that Axelrod addressed admits: He didnt say anything people hadnt heard before.\par \par \uc2 The night before Axelrod left, he dined with Miliband, Labours Election chief \uc2 Douglas Alexander\uc2  and their closest advisers. The supper raised spirits as did Axelrods suggestion that he will be back to help prepare for the last conference before the Election.\par \par \uc2 But it is a sign of the challenge facing Labour that getting Miliband into No10 is looking like a more difficult task than it was to get Americas first ever black president into the White House.\par \par \uc2 --\par \par \uc2 HOW BORIS AND DAVE WALKED INTO AN AMBUSH\par \par \uc2 THOSE lounging in Green Park in Central London on Monday afternoon must have got a shock. For striding past them were Boris Johnson and \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , as pictured left.\par \par \uc2 The pair were on their way back from campaigning in Harrow, North-West London. The joint effort was meant to show they are on the same team and that Boris is no longer fuming about what his followers saw as a \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 -led attempt to bounce him into announcing he would stand for Parliament at the next Election.\par \par \uc2 Cameron, ever keen to escape the confines of Prime Ministerial security, had grabbed the chance to get off the Tube a stop early and walk back to Westminster.\par \par \uc2 But as the pair strolled, a booming voice rang out. You should become an MP, Boris, a man shouted. Why dont you become an MP, Boris?\par \par \uc2 Boriss response: Osbornes spies are everywhere.\par \par \uc2 --\par \par \uc2 LIKE London buses quipped one Tory Minister when a second poll came along putting the Tories ahead.\par \par \uc2 The timing couldnt be better. It has boosted Tory morale ahead of an election where the party is expected to come third in a nationwide vote for the first time in its history. As one No10 aide boasts: You can point to these polls and show things look a lot better when it is a General Election.\par \par \uc2 The Tories are increasingly confident that the Newark by-election, 11 days after the European results, will show that UKIP fall away in elections that matter. No10 is doing everything it can to get as many Tories in town as possible. Cameron has visited and Ministers have even been told their prospects depend on pitching in.\par \par \uc2 Why such frenetic activity? Because the Tories know that if they can hold Newark, it will act as a circuit break against the UKIP surge that would follow a win in Europe.\par \par \uc2 --\par \par \uc2 NORMALLY, when a Secretary of State and a Minister who attends Cabinet thrash out a text line by line it is for a matter of utmost national importance. But for Education Secretary Michael Gove and his Lib Dem deputy David Laws last week, it was merely to write a newspaper article at the behest of Nick Clegg.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems had demanded Gove put his name to a piece with Laws to declare support for Cleggs free school meals scheme, which had come under fire from former Gove adviser Dominic Cummings. But Laws somehow missed Goves line that they were not like the last survivors in a Bruce Willis movie, only popping out occasionally to blast each other with shotguns. It seems Gove wasnt taking his assignment entirely seriously. Perhaps he should remember that Williss most famous movie, Die Hard, was followed by Die Harder.\par \par \uc2 Document MOSM000020140517ea5i0000z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich38\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal570

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 THE MAIL ON SUNDAY COMMENT; NINE IS MUCH TOO YOUNG TO PICK A GENDER\b0\par\par\uc2 567 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Mail on Sunday\par \uc2 MOSM\par 29\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 In our time, thanks to revolutions in social attitudes and medical practice, it is more and more common for people to express doubts about their sexual identity.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps such doubts have always been more prevalent than we realised. Perhaps they are in some cases exaggerated or encouraged by a culture in which old gender boundaries have grown increasingly vague.\par \par \uc2 Whatever the reason, they are taken more seriously, and seen at earlier ages than would once have been the case.\par \par \uc2 While some reject the modern view that those who believe they were born into the wrong body have an objective illness which can be treated with drugs and even surgery, even sceptics recognise that many such people do seek this treatment, and are often glad of it when they get it.\par \par \uc2 But the most open-minded person must be concerned when children as young as nine are prescribed potent drugs which delay the onset of puberty.\par \par \uc2 Children are full of powerful passions, fears and enthusiasm. Some of these last into adulthood, others flourish for a while and then vanish.\par \par \uc2 It is not always easy to tell which is which, and wise parents, teachers and doctors, confronted with these emotions, are patient and cautious.\par \par \uc2 The prescription of powerful body- altering drugs to children considered too young to take almost any important legal decision is impatient and rash.\par \par \uc2 Leaving aside the question of the unknown long-term effects of this medication, might not these drugs actually confirm and set in concrete a desire which might have faded away in time?\par \par \uc2 Might those who take them, in later life, regret embarking on an irreversible course which once seemed desirable, but does so no longer?\par \par \uc2 This is a delicate and difficult subject, and most of us instinctively shy away even from thinking about it. But even the most tolerant and open-minded will surely conclude that this is an intervention too far. Nine is far too soon.\par \par \uc2 VOTING ISNT A GAME\par \par \uc2 In the past, elections have been " officially at least " about policies and issues. But this weeks poll is really about the whole future of our party system.\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farages UKIP is a revolt, not a serious attempt to become the government. Tories tired of David Camerons social liberalism and Labour voters worried about mass \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  are both using UKIP as a painless way to punish their own parties.\par \par \uc2 By voting for UKIP, rebel voters hope to send a strong message to the establishment. But there is more at stake. Less than a year before a critical General Election, large-scale defections from the Tories could shake their foundations so badly that their chances of staying in government after 2015 are irreversibly destroyed.\par \par \uc2 So Thursdays vote is not a consequence-free jamboree. It is a serious moment, and requires serious reflection.\par \par \uc2 VALUE OF A FREE PRESS\par \par \uc2 Last March, The Mail on Sunday revealed the truth about Cheque Centre, a payday loan company which claimed that it did not take advantage of desperate or ignorant borrowers. In a legitimate and justified use of undercover reporting, we found the firm fell far below proper standards.\par \par \uc2 Now Cheque Centre has been sharply reined in after an intervention by the \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2 . Once again, strong, independent journalism, loathed and feared by so many in the establishment, has proved its worth.\par \par \uc2 Document MOSM000020140517ea5i0000r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NEWS\par \b \uc2 Killer deported three years after claiming human rights to stay in Britain\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Barrett Home Affairs Correspondent   \par \uc2 1,188 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par 09:45\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 A killer who threw a man into the Thams has finally been deported, three years after judges blocked his deportation on human rights grounds.\par \par \uc2 A foreign criminal who killed an innocent man by throwing him into the Thames has finally been deported from Britain in a victory for the Government and The Telegraph\u8217\'20\'19s End the Human Rights Farce campaign.\par \par \uc2 Rocky Gurung has been returned to Nepal three years after this newspaper first disclosed how \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  judges had blocked his deportation on human rights grounds.\par \par \uc2 The Home Office disclosed that Gurung, 25, was quietly deported in February this year after a long-running legal fight which is believed to have cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds.\par \par \uc2 Last night, Dominic Raab, the Tory MP who has campaigned for reform of human rights laws, thanked The Sunday Telegraph for bringing the case to light and paid tribute to the Home Office for \u8220\'20\'1Cdoggedly pursuing\u8221\'20\'1D Gurung\u8217\'20\'19s deportation.\par \par \uc2 The victim of the attack, Bishal Gurung, was one of Mr Raab\u8217\'20\'19s constituents.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI am grateful to The Telegraph for bringing the original proceedings to my attention, and for putting their shoulder behind the campaign for reform,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr Raab.\par \par \uc2 Bishal Gurung, who was not related to his killer, was a waiter whose father, Cpl Khem Barsad Gurung, served with the Gurkhas for 16 years. He was thrown into the Thames by Rocky Gurung one night during April 2008 in what the trial judge described as an \u8220\'20\'1Cunprovoked and senseless episode\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Rocky Gurung was jailed for three years for manslaughter. However, after finishing his prison sentence he launched two appeals against deportation and persuaded judges that it would breach his \u8220\'20\'1Cright to private and family life\u8221\'20\'1D if he was sent back to Nepal \u8211\'20\'13 even though he was single with no children and lived with his parents.\par \par \uc2 Home Office lawyers fought to deport Rocky Gurung, arguing that there was no substance in his claim under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, because he had no dependants. They urged judges to deport the killer, who had only been in the country for three years when he committed the crime.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Justice Blake, who at the time was the country\u8217\'20\'19s most senior \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  judge, ruled it would be \u8220\'20\'1Cdisproportionate\u8221\'20\'1D to split him from his parents.\par \par \uc2 At the time, the victim\u8217\'20\'19s sister Karuna, who was studying in north London, expressed her shock at the decision and disclosed that until contacted by this newspaper the family had not been informed that the killer had won the right to stay in Britain.\par \par \uc2 She said at the time: \u8220\'20\'1CIf the killers were deported then at least his family would know a little of the pain we have endured.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 However, it has now emerged that the Home Office appealed against Mr Justice Blake\u8217\'20\'19s decision. Although the precise details are still unclear, it is understood that the Government\u8217\'20\'19s appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal and \u8211\'20\'13 despite a further appeal by Gurung \u8211\'20\'13 was ultimately successful.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Jackson, the director of the Home Office\u8217\'20\'19s Criminal Casework Directorate, confirmed in a letter to Dominic Raab that Gurung, who had been on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  bail, had been detained on February 16 this year and deported five days later.\par \par \uc2 Last night, Karuna Gurung, who has now moved to the United States to start a new life, said: \u8220\'20\'1CI had received an email from Dominic Raab, the MP for Esher and Walton, who informed me about Rocky Gurung.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMe and my mom are extremely pleased to get the news and thankful to Dominic for his contribution.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Bishal\u8217\'20\'19s uncle, Suresh Gurung, also a former Gurkha, said: \u8220\'20\'1CI am very pleased that one of Bishal\u8217\'20\'19s killers has been deported.\u8221\'20\'1D The 46-year-old uncle from Farnborough, who served 17 years with the 1st and 2nd Battalions, The Royal Gurkha Rifles, had earlier described how the death had been \u8220\'20\'1Cawful\u8221\'20\'1D for the family and had left Bishal\u8217\'20\'19s mother Sarada, who lost her husband when her children were small, deeply distraught.\par \par \uc2 Mr Raab praised the decision to deport Rocky Gurung. \u8220\'20\'1CI am relieved, both for my constituent\u8217\'20\'19s family and the wider public, that this man has finally been removed,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CCredit goes to the Home Office for doggedly pursuing his deportation. But, it is absurd how many human rights obstacles were laid in front of this common sense outcome.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe need to make sure the Government\u8217\'20\'19s current reforms make it easier to deport this kind of violent thug, and clear away the legal excuses that gum up the system.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The original attack took place in April 2008. At the time, Bishal Gurung was working at a Nepalese restaurant in Esher \u8211\'20\'13 Mr Raab\u8217\'20\'19s Surrey constituency \u8211\'20\'13 and had travelled into London to celebrate Nepalese new year.\par \par \uc2 After leaving a party on a boat on the Thames in the early hours he was chased along the Embankment by 10 to 15 men including Rocky Gurung.\par \par \uc2 The Old Bailey trial heard the gang had falsely accused 23-year-old Bishal of hitting another man, Kemik Thakali, with a bottle.\par \par \uc2 One witness told the court that Bishal was \u8220\'20\'1Con his hands and knees\u8221\'20\'1D being kicked and beaten by seven or eight men and was then thrown into the Thames by Rocky Gurung and Thakali, from Morden, south-west London. Rocky Gurung and Thakali were both jailed for three years for manslaughter.\par \par \uc2 Rocky Gurung only came to Britain in 2005 but had won indefinite leave to remain because his father had also served with the Gurkhas.\par \par \uc2 When he lost his initial appeal against deportation, he appealed again to the Upper Chamber of the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  and Asylum Chamber.\par \par \uc2 His lawyers argued that his right to a family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights would be breached if he was deported, because all his immediate family live in Britain. The judges agreed that deporting him would be \u8220\'20\'1Cdisproportionate\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Mr Justice Blake said in his ruling: \u8220\'20\'1CWe conclude that the family life that the appellant enjoyed with his family in this country from 2005 was not suddenly cut off when he reached the age of 18 and his personal circumstances had not otherwise materially changed.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Gurung\u8217\'20\'19s successful appeal has been repeatedly cited by lawyers representing foreign criminals in other appeals against deportation, and has become a key part of case law when applications are being heard from offenders who wish to make a human rights claim based on a relationship with their extended family.\par \par \uc2 Sir Andrew Green, the chairman of the pressure group MigrationWatch, said: \u8220\'20\'1CThis is very good news indeed. It is an important success for The Sunday Telegraph\u8217\'20\'19s campaign. The Home Office and Dominic Raab are also to be congratulated for their persistence.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAt last we are beginning to get some balance between the interests of society and the family rights of particular criminals.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CUnfortunately, it may be that this case stands as a precedent. If so, that needs to be put right.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140518ea5i0018h\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 CONFIDENTIAL AGENT\b0\par\par\uc2 553 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Express\par \uc2 THEXSU\par \uc2 1; Scotland\par 77\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) Copyright Express Newspapers 2014   \par \par \uc2 LOTTE VON TRIPPE defends letting fees and reveals why using an agent can be prudent\par \par \uc2 ADEAR old friend has just popped into the office with a tale of woe as long as her legs. The former model has been investing in property for a number of years.\par \par \uc2 The luxury London apartment in Chelsea that she bought pre-Olympics has paid off handsomely, but not all of her portfolio is as glamorous.\par \par \uc2 Like many buy-to-let investors, her bread and butter comes from modest apartments which she manages entirely herself.\par \par \uc2 Among her interests are a couple of High Street shops with flats above in a small Surrey town. She lets them directly to save paying fees to a letting agent.\par \par \uc2 "You know that flat of mine above the Oxfam shop?" she starts. "It seems to be full of illegal \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 "Oh. How so?" I ask. "Well. I was letting it to a man who worked for \uc2 IBM\uc2  but it seems he has been posted abroad."\par \par \uc2 "I've Been Moved." "I beg your pardon?" "I've Been Moved; it's the acronym for \uc2 IBM...never\uc2  mind," I say.\par \par \uc2 So she went on with the story about how the man had said he knew an Indian lady with a baby who needed somewhere to rent and she had moved in.\par \par \uc2 Then a few weeks later one of the shop assistants mentioned that she had not seen the Indian woman for a while but there were a lot of Chinese people coming and going.\par \par \uc2 "You should have used a letting agent," I said, adding: "You know they are trying to pass laws forcing landlords to check that anyone they rent to is a legal resident? Not to mention that you are now a landlord of a House in Multiple Occupation and of health and are probably breaking all sorts of health and safety laws. Not to mention losing a baby."\par \par \uc2 "Thanks," said my friend. "According to the ladies in the shop, there are at least seven of these Chinese people living upstairs.\par \par \uc2 "They also say that they have seen an Indian man in a white van coming to the flat every Monday night. We assume he must be collecting the rent."\par \par \uc2 "The new enhanced rent, you mean," I say. "You will have to get a private eye to stake out the shop and follow him home," I suggest. "That will be expensive."\par \par \uc2 AT THIS point Tim, who had been listening quietly, turned to my friend and said rather aggressively: "So what's your problem?" "Well," she said. "I don't know who they are. They could be anyone. And as Lotte says, I am probably breaking the law even though it is not my fault. And now I am going to have to pay for a private eye or something."\par \par \uc2 She began to look weepy, which always works wonder with Tim.\par \par \uc2 "Why don't you just knock on the door and ask them to pay you the rent in future.

(97mins, 12A) Director: Hossein Amino Stars: Viggo Mortensen, Oscar Isaac, Kirsten Dunst IN SECRET ..... (15, 102mins) Director: Stars: Oscar Isaac, Mary Elizabeth Olsen, Jessica Lange, Tom Felton GADZOOKS! Gareth Edwards, a thirtysomething Brit, has graduated from the micro budget Monsters (special effects courtesy of his home computer) to Godzilla (special effects courtesy of a \u163\'00\'A395million budget) in one monster-sized step. It is an enormous leap of faith in the Nuneaton-raised director, not least since it falls to him to erase memories of the little-loved Godzilla directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) in 1998.\par \par \uc2 Can Edwards show Emmerich how it should be done? The answer is, yes... up to a point, the point being approximately half way into the film when, after a gripping start, the picture becomes, well, just another monster movie.\par \par \uc2 Human interest is crushed under (giant) foot and the picture evolves into a series of lavish set pieces; albeit impressive but lacking the tension that comes from caring what happens. It is disappointing after a cracking initial 50 minutes that prove Edwards to be a maestro of suspense, cranking up the anticipation and intrigue with Spielbergian panache.\par \par \uc2 We get a family in jeopardy, an imminent threat only one man foresees and earthshaking intimations of disaster while the monster remains teasingly unseen. Think Jurassic Park crossed with War Of The Worlds, a doom-laden scenario in which the creatures unleashed (Godzilla has company) will rampage on a global scale.\par \par \uc2 True to Godzilla's Japanese roots the action starts in Japan where a nervy Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston from TV's Breaking Bad), an American scientist who works at a nuclear power plant, is getting jittery about strong tremors. In a stomach-churningly tense sequence his fears that no mere earthquake is to blame prove devastatingly correct: the plant is destroyed with dreadful personal consequences.\par \par \uc2 That was in 1999 and we cut to the present to find Joe a shambling obsessive. Still in Japan, he is convinced the truth is being covered up while his now grown-up son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a bomb disposal expert with the \uc2 US army\uc2 , tries to talk sense into him.\par \par \uc2 The family dynamics give the picture a fierce human focus and Cranston is terrific as a lonely Cassandra; his surname Brody presumably a nod to Roy Scheider's Brody in Jaws. Unfortunately the characters are muscled off screen to make way for the monsters and the picture becomes a showcase for epic destruction, fun in parts but lacking the excitement that comes from emotional engagement.\par \par \uc2 Godzilla, a mighty beast with a barrel chest and bear-like visage, is actually on our side. The real villains are two "mutant spawn" of Godzilla who can fly (they resemble colossal alien-like mosquitos) and wreak all the havoc. Very much in their shadow, bland Ford makes for a dull hero while the plotting is contrived and sometimes confused: an attempt to join the dots between set pieces.\par \par \uc2 There are some rather brazen attempts to engage our sympathies during the mayhem, acknowledgement perhaps of the picture's narrative flaws. For example, a young boy we have never met is temporarily united with Ford to give us someone to fret over when the monorail they are riding in Honolulu comes under attack. Never seen again, he is just there to inject a bit of jeopardy.\par \par \uc2 That we have someone to root for in these sequences is vital since the rest of the planet is going up in smoke and the battle already seems to be lost: thousands dead, whole cities trashed (Las Vegas becomes a smouldering ruin in the blink of an eye). Meanwhile, top tier cast members like Sally Hawkins, who plays a scientist, and Elizabeth Olsen, who plays Ford's wife, barely register.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, Edwards conjures up an extraordinary spectacle and creates an eerie, oppressive atmosphere that, in the picture's quieter moments, is very effective.\par \par \uc2 Fans should be more than happy: the picture is reverent to Godzilla folklore while bringing some inventive new twists to the legend. It may not deliver on its promise but no doubt Edwards will.\par \par \uc2 AMERICANS abroad in cream linen suits. Sex and murder under the hot sun. South-east Europe redolent with history and intrigue. Set in 1962 and based on the Patricia Highsmith novel, The Two Faces Of January is a pleasurable throwback to the character-driven thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock, rich in atmosphere and immaculately tailored.\par \par \uc2 Like many of Highsmith's works, including Strangers On A Train and The Talented Mr Ripley, it finds two men from opposing backgrounds forging a potentially catastrophic alliance. They are suave, worldly businessman Chester (Viggo Mortensen) who is holidaying in Greece with his young wife Colette (Kirsten Dunst) and a handsome tour guide, Rydal (Oscar Isaac), with an eye for the main chance.\par \par \uc2 Like Chester, Rydal is American but he is younger, considerably poorer and very much alone having lost contact with his family; he did not even attend his father's recent funeral. He latches on to the sophisticated American couple (we assume to fleece them, as he does the trusting tourists in his charge) but finds the tables turned when Chester's own suspect dealings come back to haunt him.\par \par \uc2 Writer-director Hossein Amini cleverly toys with our assumptions as he strips away Chester's integrity and composure while suggesting that Rydal may be more sincere than appearances suggest, in particular in the attention he pays to Colette.\par \par \uc2 More character drama than thriller, the story explores the shifting dynamics among the trio as events force them to hide out in Crete while waiting for false passports which will allow Chester and Colette to make their escape.\par \par \uc2 The sun-baked locations are beautiful and the ancient sites (the picture opens at the Parthenon) are nicely redolent of the decaying relationships unfolding before us.\par \par \uc2 Best of all, the acting is terrific especially from the magnetic Isaac who is as irresistibly watchable here as he was in Inside Llewyn Davis. He also plays the most intriguing character, a man you are constantly trying to second guess.\par \par \uc2 However, none of the three commands much sympathy (Rydal is too compromised to count as an innocent victim) and the suspense never really cranks up.\par \par \uc2 There is one tense sequence when Rydal and Chester have to bluff their way through \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  but otherwise little to make us sweat.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the relationships do not quite draw you in emotionally, especially that between Rydal and Colette on which the whole drama really hangs. It should be intense but feels perfunctory.\par \par \uc2 Yet there is much to savour in the fabulous location work, intelligent writing and Marcel Zyskind's exquisite cinematography. Amini directs with elegance and subtlety.\par \par \uc2 In Secret is the rather bland title for a racy adaptation of Zola's Therese Raquin that boasts strong performances from a first-class cast but never quite justifies its existence.\par \par \uc2 Elizabeth Olsen plays the frustrated Therese, trapped in a sexless marriage to sickly cousin Camille (a very good Tom Felton), who is swept up in a torrid affair with dashing family friend Laurent (Oscar Isaac) in 19th-century Paris.\par \par \uc2 It rattles along compellingly enough if you do not know the story but feels rather dated and is too melodramatic to move.\par \par \uc2 Document THEXSU0020140518ea5i000bc\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Learn to be British SAYSASIAN Minister\b0\par\par\uc2 Nina Massey   \par \uc2 135 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 Sunday Express\par \uc2 THEXSU\par \uc2 1s1; Lancs\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) Copyright Express Newspapers 2014   \par \par \b \uc2 IMMIGRANTS\b0 \uc2  need to learn to speak English and to "respect our way of life", new Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has said.\par \par \uc2 The son of Pakistaniborn parents and the first Asian Secretary of State, Mr Javid said people were entitled to expect \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  to contribute to society.\par \par \uc2 "People want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right," he told a Sunday paper.\par \par \uc2 "People also say, when \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  do come to Britain, they should come to work, and make a contribution and that they should respect our way of life, and I agree.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 An influx of workers from Europe is turning Britain into the West's low-wage capital, UKIP's Nigel Farage tells Tim Shipman\par \par \uc2 BRITAIN will no longer be a "first world country" for millions of ordinary workers unless the UK gets control of its borders, Nigel Farage declared as he vowed to put \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  at the top of the agenda for the last week of the European election campaign.\par \par \uc2 Launching his final push for victory in Thursday's vote, the UKIP leader said economic turmoil in the eurozone meant "the potential for a large migratory wave" from southern Europe to Britain had "never been greater".\par \par \uc2 Farage risked fresh controversy yesterday by repeating his claim that people had a right to object to Romanians as neighbours because they were more likely to be criminals.\par \par \uc2 He told The Sunday Times \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  had benefited "big corporates" and "the rich", who had hired cheap foreign workers and domestic staff. But he said: "This country is becoming the lowwage capital of the western world. We face the prospect where millions of British families, unless we take a grip on our borders, will effectively not be living in a first world country any more."\par \par \uc2 Farage rejected figures released last week showing that Romanian and Bulgarian migration to the UK dropped in the first three months of the year after restrictions were lifted, saying "the fact that everyone hasn't come on day one doesn't mean a thing". He said UKIP's plan for an Australian-style points system to attract "people who've got skills or trades" would limit net migration to between 10,000 and 40,000, against 212,000 last year \u8212\'20\'14 more than double \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's stated target.\par \par \uc2 "There is no point in Cameron or [Ed] Miliband or [Nick] Clegg talking about ambitions for net migration. The only way we can control it is to divorce ourselves from political union: 485m people have got EU passports \u8212\'20\'14 they effectively have a British passport. As many of them as want to come, can come."\par \par \uc2 Farage has claimed UKIP will cause "an earthquake" by winning on Thursday. But after polls showing the party streaking ahead, UKIP is neck and neck with Labour. Today's YouGov poll puts UKIP on 26%, a point behind Labour and three clear of the Tories. Among those certain to vote, UKIP has a slender lead.\par \par \uc2 Will he win? Farage bites his lip: "It's going to be tight." Does he regret predicting victory? "Of course not."\par \par \uc2 Farage has faced a bruising week. A woman of Asian descent resigned from UKIP's youth wing, accusing the party of descending into "racist populism". UKIP candidates have been exposed for racist and homophobic views. His spin doctor, Patrick O'Flynn, intervened to stop an interview with LBC radio on Friday, in part, because Farage was running late for his interview with The Sunday Times. But not before he was branded racist for suggesting people "know" which foreigners make good neighbours.\par \par \uc2 In a statement yesterday he defended his suspicion of Romanians. "Police figures are clear that there is a high level of criminality within the Romanian community in Britain," he said. Farage admitted "most" Romanians were not criminals but added: "Any normal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door."\par \par \uc2 In his interview with this newspaper Farage vowed to expel the "idiots" from the party. He blamed the "political establishment" for the negative coverage. "Over the last few weeks the ability to debate the EU has been absent. For them to have been held up as representative of our party isn't the case."\par \par \uc2 He also dismissed fears that leaving the EU would lead to economic disaster. "The UK is the EU's greatest export market. They sell us more than we sell them. We buy getting on for a million more cars than we sell. We buy 20m bottles of champagne every year."\par \par \uc2 Farage gave a strong hint he will pick a constituency in Kent to contest next year, although Eastleigh, where UKIP ran the Liberal Democrats close in a by-election, remains an option. Farage would consider overtures from Eurosceptic Tories. He said the option of joint Conservative-UKIP tickets "might be a good one".\par \par \uc2 Last week he confessed he would prop up a minority Cameron government if it meant a referendum and UKIP MPs held the balance of power. He claimed to have no interest in a cabinet job. But it "would be tempting" if he was offered minister for Europe. "I might make an exception for that. I'd like to go and see the next commission president to negotiate our withdrawal."\par \par \uc2 Marching west to kill EU from within, page 33 @shippersunbound\par \par \uc2 26% Labour UKIP Conservative Other Lib Dem 27% 23% 9% 15% How will you vote in the European elections?

About 59% opted for various other terms and 5% did not know.\par \par \uc2 UKIP denied the party is racist. "We know that we're not, but the constant daily media barrage and from all our opponents is having an impact," a spokesman said.\par \par \uc2 The Scottish sample in the latest YouGov poll for The Sunday Times suggests UKIP may have half as much support north of the border as at a UK level \u8212\'20\'14 7% against 13% \u8212\'20\'14 similar to the Lib Dems on 5%.\par \par \uc2 UKIP believes that it has "a fighting chance" of winning a Scottish seat.\par \par \uc2 "If we do it presents a huge problem for \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  because the message from the SNP has been that there aren't people like that in Scotland. Well, yes there are. Even if we don't get someone elected in Scotland we will be within spitting distance," said the spokesman.\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140518ea5i00112\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 The future of Scotland in the Union hangs on a knife edge \u8212\'20\'14 and the nation's 400,000 English residents may have the final say, write Gillian Bowditch and Jason Allardyce\par \par \uc2 For Anya O'Shea, the Scottish independence referendum is a chance to make history, not just study it. The final-year Edinburgh University student, who grew up in London, will vote No on September 18. For her, Scottish independence is an idea whose time has passed.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to be divided from my family down south by a needless border," says O'Shea, a history student who campaigns for Better Together. "My dad is Welsh. My mum is a Polish \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2 . I have an Irish surname. I'm from London but I've grown up in Scotland and plan to live here after graduating. The separatist idea of everyone in different parts of the landmass being totally different just makes no sense to me.\par \par \uc2 "I'm at university, surrounded by young people from all over Britain and the rest of the world. The internet is bringing people together all the time. People are moving around for work and studies, and independence seems an old-fashioned idea. The world is moving in a direction of bringing down borders and barriers. My friends and I are just starting our careers. We would be the generation that would carry independence. It's about seeing the rest of your life ahead of you with so much uncertainty and so many potential restrictions that currently don't exist."\par \par \uc2 O'Shea's views chime with the findings of the latest Sunday Times Panelbase poll. While those born and bred in Scotland are almost equally divided between the two camps, with a very slight majority favouring independence, those born over the border are far more likely to vote No than Yes. It means, in a close ballot, English voters, who make up 9% of the population, could swing the referendum for the unionists. The poll shows 40% of voters overall in Scotland favour independence, with 47% against and 13% undecided. If the undecided are excluded, the figure is 46% for independence and 54% against. Strip out those who are not Scottish and the margin is much narrower: 44% of Scots say Yes, 42% say No and 14% are undecided.\par \par \uc2 But among people of English origin living in Scotland, only 27% back independence, with 66% against and 7% undecided. The figure is similar for all non-Scots, with 25% backing independence and 65% against.\par \par \uc2 There are 4.1m people eligible to vote in the referendum, of whom 422,386 are English; 35,123 are Northern Irish; and 16,186 are Welsh. These votes could make the difference between success and failure for \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2 's campaign, and could potentially lead to increased tensions.\par \par \uc2 "THE classic example is the referendum in Quebec in 1995 where there was a case of what they called les autres \u8212\'20\'14 the others," says Professor Matt Qvortrup, author of Referendums and Ethnic Conflict. "It was a really tight race, absolutely neck and neck. Then it transpired that those who had voted No, who had swung it basically, had been the anglophones.\par \par \uc2 "Jacques Parizeau [the premier of Quebec and leader of the pro-independence Parti Quebecois] came out on election night, being slightly tipsy, and said it was les autres \u8212\'20\'14 it was them \u8212\'20\'14 and the implication was had it not been for those traitors then we would have had an independent Quebec. He ended up having to eat humble pie, but the sentiment was very much there. "It's not nasty like that in Scotland and everybody can accept that. But even the people who were fair-minded about it in Quebec, when pressed about it, felt cheated. The implications were so great and it divided families and it really turned nasty. If you speak to Canadians, they will tell you it was very hard fought and very bitter."\par \par \uc2 Qvortrup says the all-inclusive civic nationalism of the SNP, as opposed to the ethnic nationalism of the Quebecois, is likely to temper any backlash should a minority of English voters swing the vote in favour of the Union.\par \par \uc2 "Referendums are always bare-knuckle fights," he says. "The Scottish referendum is tough but friendly. I do think it is going to get worse and there will be some very shrill voices ... There might be a wee bit of bitterness but the SNP is the only example internationally of a multi-ethnic nationalist party. What is interesting about them is the way they are selling it. You can be a Scottish nationalist and an Indian or an Italian or an Englishman."\par \par \uc2 There are, of course, plenty of English-born people \u8212\'20\'14 including cabinet ministers Mike Russell and Shona Robison \u8212\'20\'14 who will vote for independence. Andy Lythgoe is one. The 56-year-old commercial property consultant has lived in Scotland since the 1980s, but would describe himself as English.\par \par \uc2 "I still have family and friends south of the border but I don't think independence will affect the social union," says Lythgoe. "My reason for voting Yes is essentially economic. If you'd asked me how I would have voted in the late 1980s when I came to Scotland, I'm sure like a lot of people I would have been a No voter. But working for a large property consultancy I got to understand a bit more about the Scottish economy. The propaganda that the people in the UK, not just Scotland, have been fed is that Scotland is unduly subsidised. The reality is, the opposite is true. I firmly believe that, given the opportunity to make decisions for itself, Scotland will be in a position to perform better economically and socially." The Panelbase poll comes just days after David Cameron visited Scotland and invoked the memory of the late Labour leader John Smith in an attempt to defuse claims that voting No makes you "less Scottish". John Curtice, professor of politics at \uc2 Strathclyde University\uc2 , says it is British identity, not Scottish identity, which is the key to the vote.\par \par \uc2 "Cameron is trying to neutralise the issue of identity but everyone in Scotland feels Scottish," says Curtice. "That's not the source of division. It's how British they feel that is crucial. People who were not born in Scotland are more likely to feel strongly British and they are also the group most likely to want to hold on to the Union. If it were merely about how Scottish people feel, Scotland would have been independent years ago. The point is, this is a referendum in a society with a dual sense of identity. One identity is stronger than the other but that weaker identity seems to be enough to help to pull people into the No camp.\par \par \uc2 "Feeling strongly Scottish may be almost a necessary condition for voting Yes, but it's not a sufficient condition. You need other reasons as well. Another interesting factor is that the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey suggests that the proportion of people who deny they are British has fallen in the past few years. It used to be 30% who said they felt Scottish but not British. More recently it has been 25%. In 2012, that may have been the Olympics effect but for 2013 it is much the same. It seems that some people in Scotland have rediscovered their residual Britishness."\par \par \uc2 Identity politics has a long but not particularly happy history. It is a sensitive issue, particularly in a World Cup year when anti-English sentiment has occasionally reared its head. The SNP and particularly Salmond have worked hard to ensure their brand of civic nationalism is all-inclusive. Scots of all political persuasions and none have finely tuned antennas. When the author Alasdair Gray wrote an essay calling English incomers either "settlers" or "colonists", there was a big outcry. This month Finlay Calder, a former Scottish rugby international and British and Irish Lions captain, told The Sunday Times he believed Flower of Scotland, the nation's unofficial anthem, should be ditched ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow because of its anti-English sentiment. He urged the organisers to choose something more forwardlooking and uplifting. The moderator of the Church of Scotland has called on the party leaders to attend a "service of reconciliation" after the referendum.\par \par \uc2 Sir Tim Rice, the English lyricist who has an estate in the Scottish Highlands, is among those backing the Union, saying: "It would be insanity for the country to split up."\par \par \uc2 He is uncertain whether he will retain a Scottish base in the event of independence. "If [the SNP members) are as insane independently as they are not independently, then a lot of people might say, 'Stuff this for a game of soldiers.' Who knows?" Alan Bissett, a writer and performer, has been a staunch supporter of the Yes Scotland campaign. Last week he tweeted a poster of a young girl with her mouth taped over, under the banner "Jockholm Syndrome \u8212\'20\'14 don't think we do that for you." Bissett wrote: "Jockholm Syndrome \u8212\'20\'14 Condition of a Scot who identifies with the same British state which keeps Scotland captive."\par \par \uc2 The image caused an outcry. Jill Stephenson, a professor at Edinburgh University, led the condemnation. "When people say, 'If you are not voting Yes, you are a traitor, you are a quisling, you are part of the Jockholm syndrome,' that is extremely offensive," she said.\par \par \uc2 Last week Bissett, who had removed the tweet, was contrite. "[Stephenson's] criticisms were probably fair. I take what she said on board. I got into the campaign for positive reasons and to create a better Scotland. If I find myself throwing shit at people, what stage of the campaign have we reached here? I lapsed into that and it brought me up short. If people feel genuinely British, I have to respect that."\par \par \uc2 He added: "They live here and if we want to welcome them here they have to have the same democratic rights as everyone else. If they vote as an expression of their British identity, Scots have to accept that. People are very sensitive about nationalism for good reason. [For independence to feel] like the right way ahead, it has to be an inclusive and positive project. I don't think there will be a backlash [against the English] because the majority of people in the Yes campaign are inclusive. If there were a narrow No vote, I think there would be a determined campaign not to scapegoat anyone. Apart from anything else, that would prove the harshest critics of the Yes campaign correct."\par \par \uc2 Curtice points out that it will be some weeks after the referendum, when all the analysis is done, that we will know what factors influenced the vote. If it is a slender No win, as the polls predict, that could be due to any one of a number of socio-economic groups \u8212\'20\'14 youth, women, non-Scots \u8212\'20\'14 who backed the Union, but he points out that the narrower the vote, the more heated the aftermath is likely to be.\par \par \uc2 "There will be a broader issue about reconciliation," he says. "This is being fought pretty brutally on both sides. If Scotland votes No, there are lots of people on the nationalist side who will be very disappointed. If Scotland votes Yes, it will come as a brutal shock to a lot of unionists who just assumed it would never happen. Whatever happens, there will be a need to come together."\par \par \uc2 EVERYONE IN SCOTLAND FEELS SCOTTISH. IT'S HOW BRITISH THEY FEEL THAT IS CRUCIAL\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140518ea5i0010v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

You only spent what you could afford. My father was an Italian \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  and it was tough for \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  because there were no benefits. But my parents\u8217\'20\'19 businesses did well and they were generous.\par \par \uc2 What was your first job?\par \par \uc2 A college chum and I sold encyclopedias, which was a great learning experience. We were sent into no-hope areas and told to say such things as \u8220\'20\'1CIs a washing machine more important than your children\u8217\'20\'19s education?\u8221\'20\'1D Sometimes the door was slammed in your face, quite rightly, then we finally got a signature from these people who could not afford this pointless encyclopedia. On the bus home we were both thinking that it was just wrong, so we went back and talked them out of it. It took us as long as it did to sell them the bloody thing.\par \par \uc2 So you didn\u8217\'20\'19t earn a penny?\par \par \uc2 No. Never employ me as a salesman.\par \par \uc2 What about your first acting\u160\'00\'A0pay cheque?\par \par \uc2 My first proper job was in rep in Glasgow in the early Sixties. The pay was \u163\'00\'A38 a week. The leading actors got \u163\'00\'A311 and with that they paid for their digs, food and a drink on a Saturday night. Amazing. The standard of plays wasn\u8217\'20\'19t good, really, and one very foggy night the fog came into the theatre. We could barely see the audience. I think there were about eight people out\u160\'00\'A0there.\par \par \uc2 Was there an obvious financial turning point in your\u160\'00\'A0career?\par \par \uc2 It could have been a play at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh in 1971. We were living in London by this time, so I said: \u8220\'20\'1CI can\u8217\'20\'19t come to Edinburgh for \u163\'00\'A314 a week.\u8221\'20\'1D The producer said: \u8220\'20\'1CWell, Nigel Hawthorne said the same thing and he hasn\u8217\'20\'19t stopped working since.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 So I did it and that\u8217\'20\'19s exactly what happened. From that, I got a play in London with Paul Scofield called Savages. Everybody came to see Paul, and I occasionally got glanced at. That led to a movie with Joseph Losey.\par \par \uc2 Then the big change came with the television series The Glittering Prizes because that introduced me to America. The fact it was shown there made it easier when a producer decided to take the play I was in, Whose Life is it Anyway?, to New York. He proved in court that I had the right to enter America \u8211\'20\'13 as \u8220\'20\'1Can alien of extraordinary ability\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 God bless America is all I can say.\par \par \uc2 What\u8217\'20\'19s the difference in pay\u160\'00\'A0in America?\par \par \uc2 Huge. When the American producer Barney Rosenzweig came here he said: \u8220\'20\'1CFor God\u8217\'20\'19s sake, how do you people manage? Nobody earns any money and everything costs a \u8209\'20\'11\u8209\'20\'11\u8209\'20\'11\u8209\'20\'11ing fortune.\u8221\'20\'1D For a television movie in this country at that time you might have been paid five grand. There, you would be paid \u163\'00\'A3250,000. I was astounded.\par \par \uc2 What has been your best\u8209\'20\'11paid\u160\'00\'A0job?\par \par \uc2 A movie in 1986 called Miracles, a comedy about a divorced couple. I\u8217\'20\'19m not going into how much I got, but a lot.\par \par \uc2 Did your fee go up after Shirley Valentine?\par \par \uc2 It had already gone up, but it was a little boost. It was obviously a good combination, Pauline [Collins] and me, so I would have thought any producer worth their salt would have said \u8220\'20\'1CLet\u8217\'20\'19s find something else and put them in it\u8221\'20\'1D, but nobody came up with that idea. It\u8217\'20\'19s nice that it\u8217\'20\'19s still watched. And you get residuals on DVD sales. I get quite a lot from the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises.\par \par \uc2 How lucrative were the Vauxhall advertisements you\u160\'00\'A0did in the Nineties?\par \par \uc2 It was a huge amount of money. Those were the last days of the golden age of advertising.\par \par \uc2 You\u8217\'20\'19re working in the West End now. Is theatre paid well\u160\'00\'A0enough?\par \par \uc2 For most actors, absolutely not. Most live in penury all their lives. A few of us have been extraordinarily lucky. If you\u8217\'20\'19re a leading actor on a percentage of the box office it can be quite good, but you\u8217\'20\'19ve got to be good enough to bring people in. You\u8217\'20\'19re expected to earn it.\par \par \uc2 Has there been a time when\u160\'00\'A0you really worried about money?\par \par \uc2 You worry about money all the time because you fear that every job might be your last. At one point I was playing guitar in restaurants to pay the rent. It was miserable. It\u8217\'20\'19s easier to walk on to a stage and start King Lear than it is to walk out into a restaurant and start singing. One evening a man put his hands over his ears and I thought: \u8220\'20\'1CI agree with you, chum.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 </br>Have you ever done anything for the money that you regretted artistically?\par \par \uc2 Not for the money, though I\u8217\'20\'19ve done things I\u8217\'20\'19ve regretted. I did a new Arthur Miller play called The Ride Down Mt Morgan. I always arrange an out-loud reading with chums before I do a play, but I didn\u8217\'20\'19t with this. I thought, \u8220\'20\'1CHe\u8217\'20\'19s Arthur Miller, for God\u8217\'20\'19s sake, and writes fabulous plays.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Halfway through the first rehearsal I got a terrible cold feeling down my back and thought, \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s something seriously wrong with this bloody play.\u8221\'20\'1D But you couldn\u8217\'20\'19t go to Arthur and say, \u8220\'20\'1CYou\u8217\'20\'19ve really got to look at the second act.\u8221\'20\'1D It lasted about three\u160\'00\'A0weeks.\par \par \uc2 What has been your best\u160\'00\'A0investment?\par \par \uc2 Buying my house in Hampstead 29 years ago was the only financially sensible thing I\u8217\'20\'19ve done because it\u8217\'20\'19s the family\u8217\'20\'19s security. It has gone up in value about 15 times. If the Stalinist Mr Clegg ever got his desire for a mansion tax, we wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be able to live here.\par \par \uc2 What do you think of the idea of a tax on high earners?\par \par \uc2 Insane and pointless. No one should pay more than 25pc of their income in tax \u8211\'20\'13 a flat rate for Amazon and everybody. Money has to circulate and at the moment it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t. If you let people have more of their own money, the country will start to work again.\par \par \uc2 What has been your biggest\u160\'00\'A0financial mistake?\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m not a financial gambler, so I\u8217\'20\'19ve never ventured anything and lost it.\par \par \uc2 Do you invest in shares?\par \par \uc2 No. I\u8217\'20\'19m not hungry enough. I did buy a large allocation of Premium Bonds some years ago, and they were quite good. We used to win \u163\'00\'A350 a few times a month, then they halved the prize money.\par \par \uc2 Do you prefer to pay by\u160\'00\'A0cash\u160\'00\'A0or card?\par \par \uc2 Cash for small things, but mostly a debit card. I use my credit card sometimes because I\u8217\'20\'19ve got a special NatWest Black one and I don\u8217\'20\'19t feel it\u8217\'20\'19s fair to take all the benefits \u8211\'20\'13 insurance, access to airport lounges \u8211\'20\'13 if I don\u8217\'20\'19t\u160\'00\'A0use\u160\'00\'A0it.\par \par \uc2 Are you a spender or a saver?\par \par \uc2 If things were different, I\u8217\'20\'19d be a saver and enjoy the interest. I\u8217\'20\'19m not a spender beyond what I can afford. That\u8217\'20\'19s my dad talking.\par \par \uc2 What has been your most extravagant purchase?\par \par \uc2 Apart from the house, a Bentley years ago, which was \u163\'00\'A332,000. I don\u8217\'20\'19t know why I spent that. You don\u8217\'20\'19t have to. I\u8217\'20\'19m driving one now that is 30 years old. I buy old cars because I can fix them. I don\u8217\'20\'19t want to have to plug in a laptop to find out what\u8217\'20\'19s wrong with the damn car.\par \par \uc2 Does money make you\u160\'00\'A0happy?\par \par \uc2 No, but the absence of it would make me extremely sad. Money buys security and you start to live at a certain level. Life for us has been comfortable for a very long time and I wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t like that to change.\par \par \uc2 Tom Conti is appearing in \u8216\'20\'18Twelve Angry Men\u8217\'20\'19 at the Garrick Theatre, London\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140518ea5i00108\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw157\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2355\pichgoal600

Economic growth across the EU remains flat, and the social problems and shocking unemployment following austerity measures in Greece, Spain and other southern countries have left the whole concept of a united Europe of 500 million people looking fragile.\u8232\'20\'28But that is not further reason to ignore the elections of May 22; it is all the more reason to go to the polls.\par \par \uc2 Europe appears to be at a turning point. The years since the recession have seen a surge in eurosceptic parties such as Ukip and France\u8217\'20\'19s Front National. According to one recent study, around 200 of the 751 MEPs elected across Europe\u8217\'20\'19s 28 states this week could be euro\u173\'00\'ADsceptics whose goal is to wreck the EU institutions from within.\par \par \uc2 Whether greeeted with approval or disapproval, it means the election could herald profound change.\par \par \uc2 Domestically, Ukip has also pushed Labour and the Conservatives onto a more eurosceptic track, and created the real possibility of a UK withdrawal from Europe if David Cameron is returned to power next year and holds a promised referendum. If Ukip tops the polls on Thursday, that shift will accelerate, with implications for \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy and relations with our main trading partners.\par \par \uc2 Europe, once the obsession of a few blazered oddballs on the Tory right, has become one of the most salient issues of UK politics.\par \par \uc2 There is also the independence referendum dimension.\par \par \uc2 Europe has been a campaign constant, with Unionists insisting entry for an independent Scotland would be fraught if not impossible, with other states imposing the euro and the Schengen open borders arrangement.\par \par \uc2 As we report today, the senior Labour MEP David Martin has debunked such scare stories and is to be commended for his candour.\par \par \uc2 But this week is not a dry run for September 18.\par \par \uc2 If the SNP add a seat or Ukip win their first in Scotland, it will not signpost the result of the referendum, which is a unique choice.\par \par \uc2 But it will have an impact on morale, lifting the Nationalists or soothing Unionist nerves, with a Ukip gain, albeit highly unlikely, taken as a sign that \uc2 Alex Salmond\uc2  has misread the public mood.\par \par \uc2 It may be unloved, but for a host of reasons this election matters. Votes must be exercised.\par \par \uc2 Document SUNDHE0020140518ea5i00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw157\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2355\pichgoal600

All rights reserved   \par \par \b \uc2 IMMIGRANTS\b0 \uc2  should learn English and "respect" the British way of life, Sajid Javid, the culture secretary, has said.\par \par \uc2 Javid, who was promoted to the cabinet last month to replace Maria Miller, is the son of Pakistani \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and the most senior member of the government from an ethnic minority.\par \par \uc2 Speaking ahead of this week's European parliament elections, he said it is "right" that people want Britain to have more control over its borders.\par \par \uc2 "People also say, when \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  do come to Britain, that they should come to work and make a contribution and should also respect our way of life, and I agree with all of that. It means things like trying to learn English," he said. Javid, who has already been tipped as a future prime minister, became an MP only four years ago at the age of 40. He was brought up in Rochdale, where his father worked as a bus driver.\par \par \uc2 "I know people myself, I have met people, who have been in Britain for over 50 years and they still can't speak English," he said in a newspaper interview.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's perfectly reasonable for British people to say, look, if you're going to settle in Britain and make it your home you should learn the language of the country and you should respect its laws and culture."\par \par \uc2 Javid was a vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank at the age of 25 and held senior positions in \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  before his election as Conservative MP.\par \par \uc2 He said his parents "were very proud of Britain and they have always respected the country and always wanted to make a contribution". He added: "I think that is the story of most \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  I have met."\par \par \uc2 The Bromsgrove MP, who is also minister for equalities, defended Nigel Farage, the UKIP leader, over allegations that he is a racist.\par \par \uc2 "When he talks about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , the reason he's talking about it is that many people throughout Britain are concerned about excessive \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . And they should be," he told The Sunday Telegraph. "Politicians do need to respond to those concerns."\par \par \uc2 He said that while some UKIP candidates for the European and council elections have racist views, "I don't think they are a racist party and I don't think Nigel Farage is racist".\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140518ea5i000pq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Three shocks leave Miliband needing to swing the Ax at UKIP\b0\par\par\uc2 ADAM BOULTON   \par \uc2 1,079 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 1; National\par 25\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 David Axelrod's brief sojourn in London last week confirmed that the attraction between Barack Obama's strategist and Labour's leader is mutual. That's just as well, since "the Ax" took the trouble to point out to the shadow cabinet that the \u163\'00\'A3300,000 or so he and his team are being paid by Labour does not make this a serious business proposition for him.\par \par \uc2 Long before he signed up, Axelrod liked what Ed Miliband was saying about hardworking people getting left further behind the rich even as the economy improves. His job will be to embellish this "narrative arch" rather than to start building it from scratch.\par \par \uc2 The two men also agree on the task ahead in what Axelrod has dubbed "the age of alienation": a time when people who feel shut out from prosperity are also alienated from the politicians who preside over it. The task of "progressive parties" \u8212\'20\'14 Labour in the UK and the Democrats in America \u8212\'20\'14 is to persuade voters that they can improve their reallife circumstances, but without exploiting their fears and anxieties.\par \par \uc2 Awkwardly for Ed, there are others keen to recruit the alienated in the imminent local and European parliamentary elections. Unlike Labour, UKIP has no record in government that can be held against it, while the SNP is promoting Scotland's future, not its past.\par \par \uc2 The Conservatives can try to shrug off any forthcoming electoral setbacks as mid-term blues. The Liberal Democrat leadership will certainly plead that they are still enduring the growing pains of becoming a party of power. But Labour's credibility as an alternative government after the general election will be on the line in each of the council, European and Scottish contests.\par \par \uc2 Most of the council seats in contention this week were last fought on general election day 2010 \u8212\'20\'14 so they should provide a pretty direct indication of the change in political mood since then. That year was bad for Labour, so Miliband should expect to make big gains. Recent opinion polls certainly point that way.\par \par \uc2 So do recent council by-elections, according to The Sunday Times's election analysts, Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher of Plymouth University. They calculate the current national equivalent vote share as Labour 33% (up five points on 2010), Conservatives 30% (down five points), UKIP 16% (from a standing start), and Lib Dems 14% (down 11 points). If this pattern is confirmed in the postal votes now being cast and the ballot papers filled out on Thursday, Labour should make almost 500 net gains in councillors.\par \par \uc2 A senior Labour official tells me "good progress" would be 200 gains. Playing down expectations is a common tactic for spin doctors but Thrasher and Rallings believe even 300 gains would mean "Bad night: voters still blame Labour. Miliband victory in 2015 unlikely".\par \par \uc2 No party wants shocks in the last few days before polling and Labour had at least three last week: two opinion polls \u8212\'20\'14 from the reliably independent maverick Tory Michael Ashcroft and from ICM \u8212\'20\'14 showed the Tories narrowly in the lead on general election voting intentions for the first time since 2012. ICM even put the Conservatives narrowly ahead in the share of the vote in the European elections.\par \par \uc2 A Conservative showing third behind Labour and UKIP has long been part of the expected narrative when the EU results are called at 10pm next Sunday, but now it seems the opposition cannot be so sure.\par \par \uc2 Labour has switched tactics. Miliband is no longer leaving \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  to worry about UKIP while he belittles the Lib Dems. Last Friday his main campaign event was a speech about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , and yesterday in Crawley he pepped up Labour canvassers with an explicit attack on UKIP as the party that wants to keep the flame of Thatcherism alive.\par \par \uc2 During this campaign Nigel Farage has explicitly targeted former Labour voters, with some success, according to Robert Ford, an academic and co-author of the new book Revolt on the Right. His research on UKIP loyalists "suggests many are from working-class, Labour-leaning backgrounds and are deeply hostile to all the Establishment parties".\par \par \uc2 Last month Lord Glasman, Miliband's sometime "Blue Labour" guru, issued a similar warning in this newspaper: "[In 2010] the Labour middle-class vote held up," he said. "It was the working-class vote that died ... will there necessarily be a swing back to Labour from UKIP voters?" By common consent, about 40% of UKIP's core support comes from Tory voters, but in April to May, ICM and other pollsters show the biggest swing has been from Labour to UKIP. Unlike Labour, UKIP has no scruples about exploiting the anxieties of alienated voters. Unlike Miliband, Farage has no need to "apologise" for the last Labour government's openness to EU \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Talking tough on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is always going to be a delicate issue for Miliband, the son of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , especially when he must protect his left flank, and any support by disillusioned Lib Dems, from an unexpectedly strong challenge by the Green party.\par \par \uc2 The British people regard the European elections as a protest vote. In the last five cycles of voting since 1989, the main opposition party has won the largest share of the votes cast. This certainly doesn't mean it goes on to win the subsequent general election but it is still not a test Miliband can fail lightly.\par \par \uc2 As for the Scottish referendum \u8212\'20\'14 Labour's authority is the most exposed, while \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 , \uc2 Douglas Alexander\uc2  and Alistair Darling squabble. Miliband is already planning to spend much of the summer north of the border. He needs to. Should the Scots vote no to the union, they will not only overthrow Labour's long dominance; they will also deprive the party of as many as 40 potentially majority-determining MPs in the Commons.\par \par \uc2 The UK's political superstructure seems to be fragmenting at speed. Labour is already budgeting that UKIP will hold at least 9% of votes in the general election \u8212\'20\'14 and who is to say that those who stay with Farage will all be ex-Tories? The shared philosophy is the easy part. The real world is harder \u8212\'20\'14 "Milliband" and "Alexrod" can't even spell each other's names.\par \par \uc2 Trivia aside, the two men have set Labour a gargantuan task \u8212\'20\'14 to hold on to mainstream voters and win over the largest slice of the alienated.\par \par \uc2 @adamboultonsky\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140518ea5i000ma\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 My heart tells me to sulk at the EU elections but my head says vote\b0\par\par\uc2 CAMILLA CAVENDISH   \par \uc2 1,298 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 1; National\par 25\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Here it comes, this week's big decision. Will you be voting in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  elections on Thursday or will you sulk? Sulking is tempting, I admit. "Don't vote, it only encourages them" feels especially apt when the ballot papers will list MEPs we've never heard of for a parliament that is obsessed with building its own power, in an EU that tells countries to vote again if they vote the wrong way. Five years ago, two-thirds of us sulked. In the rest of the continent fewer than half turned out to vote. If your area doesn't have local council elections this week you have even less incentive to show up.\par \par \uc2 Yet I feel embarrassed. I was brought up to regard voting as a sacred right. Yes, the EU's version of democracy is a sham. Yes, there is a gulf between our pencil mark on the ballot paper and what actually happens in Brussels and Strasbourg. But it's hard to feel that apathy can be a grown-up choice. UKIP, of course, offers a chance to both sulk and vote, to sulk actively rather than silently, to register your contempt at the ballot box by voting for people who despise the institution in which they roost. It's admirably ballsy in one way. Although it doesn't feel quite right to me for someone to pocket an MEP's salary and expenses, then opt out of so much while others slog away on committees.\par \par \uc2 I recently chaired a debate between a UKIP, a Green, a Labour, a Liberal Democrat and a Tory MEP. I was taken aback by the shallowness of the first two and the dedication and knowledge of the others. However much I dislike the machine, I would rather have grown-ups trying to curb its worst excesses while it still rumbles on.\par \par \uc2 I'm not against protest votes. I, along with 15% of Britons who voted, backed the Greens in the 1989 EU election. Our little band may even have helped to bolster European environmentalists. Though now, with the Greens stuck in a 1970s groove, I'd probably have more impact on EU environmental policy by voting Lib Dem.\par \par \uc2 Leave that aside. My chief concern on Thursday, like many Brits, is to see the EU reform and return power to member states. And if it's too mulish to do that, I want the option to get out. Those who want to kick the government will probably vote Labour. Those who want to spit on the whole Westminster elite will vote UKIP or Green. Those pro-EU will vote Lib Dem.\par \par \uc2 It's less clear how to have any impact on the EU itself. To help make up my mind I rang a number of respected academics. This didn't go terribly well. The first one I spoke to said sheepishly that he is hoping to avoid having to vote by going into hospital for a routine operation. If the op is cancelled, he said, he may simply have to lie to colleagues about how he voted.\par \par \uc2 Professor Vernon Bogdanor, my old politics tutor, was more helpful. If the combined total of the UKIP and Conservative vote on Thursday is more than 50%, he thinks Ed Miliband will come under sustained pressure to promise the referendum that he has so far refused to offer.\par \par \uc2 The game would change if Labour were also offering a referendum. Of the three conventional parties only the Conservatives are currently promising a vote on Europe and they can't deliver this while they are reliant on Lib Dem support. \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  has promised a referendum in 2017, by which time it may be clearer what kind of Europe we would be in or out of. But that referendum depends on him winning a majority in the general election.\par \par \uc2 Some people think Cameron will renege. I don't. For one thing it would be suicidal in a party that is far more Eurosceptic now than it was during Maastricht. Tony Blair got away with breaking his promise to hold a vote on the Lisbon treaty only because Labour is less Eurosceptic.\par \par \uc2 What about reform? Would a vote for UKIP strengthen or weaken Cameron's hand in his attempts to negotiate a better deal for Britain? UKIP supporters say a big vote for it will show our European partners that we are deadly serious about exit. Some Conservatives fear that a strong showing by UKIP and a poor showing by the Tories will limit Cameron's room for manoeuvre, as his backbenchers will stop him making any concessions. There's probably some truth in both positions.\par \par \uc2 For many voters, it must be said, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  looms larger than any other issue, as UKIP shows with its posters. But again the only realistic hope of restricting benefits in the next three years is for British politicians to engage effectively.\par \par \uc2 EU-watchers believe this election is uniquely important because MEPs will be attempting to choose the new president of the EU Commission for the first time. The five presidential candidates are doing television debates and chats in an effort to "bring Europe closer to the people". The problem is that all of them are shades of grey: insiders, centralisers, variations on a theme that most Brits don't like.\par \par \uc2 To make matters worse, the individual MEP you elect may not have any impact on the presidency. If you vote Labour, your MEP will be part of the group that backs Germany's Martin Schulz, the leader of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. But if you were to fall for the charms of Luxembourg's Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European People's party, you can't vote for him; the Conservative party is not in his centre-right bloc.\par \par \uc2 To be honest, the sad spectacle of has-beens rattling around in presidential battle buses leaves me praying that the heads of governments will overrule the MEPs and pick a better candidate. If we want our national parliaments to have more power, we should want the EU parliament to have less.\par \par \uc2 Should we then abstain? Alan Sked, professor of international history at the London School of Economics and the founder of UKIP, thinks so.\par \par \uc2 "UKIP has no reason at all to be in the European parliament," he said. "Its MEPs have mostly been incompetents or charlatans who play no constructive part in the parliament. Every true democrat should shame the system by staying at home and registering their disgust."\par \par \uc2 Does he think the Eurocrats will actually notice? "Yes. The whole legitimacy of the EU is now in question, especially if the percentage falls again."\par \par \uc2 This is the argument for the silent sulk. It has never worked before: I don't recall Eurocrats shuddering at the British silence in 2009. But perhaps it might this time, with polls showing unprecedented cynicism across the continent and the landscape likely to be littered with populist protest parties after Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The problem is that I still cling on to my belief that I ought to exercise my right to vote. I think the grown-up thing to do will be to vote and to cast a vote that I won't subsequently feel that I have to lie about. But if I suddenly found that I had an all-day appointment on Thursday, I can't pretend I'd be sorry to get off the hook.\par \par \uc2 camilla.cavendish@sunday-times.co.uk\par \par \uc2 YES, I FEEL EMBARRASSED. YES, THE EU'S VERSION OF DEMOCRACY IS A SHAM. BUT IT'S HARD TO FEEL THAT APATHY CAN BE A GROWN-UP CHOICE\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140518ea5i000m9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 ESTABLISHED 1822\par \par \uc2 As it has since it was first published near the end of the Thatcher era in 1989, The Sunday Times Rich List will create a combination of envy, admiration and mild outrage. The 1,000 richest men and women in Britain have seen their wealth rise by 13% to \u163\'00\'A3519bn over the past year and appear to have survived the financial crisis remarkably well.\par \par \uc2 Their combined wealth is now more than a quarter higher than it was in 2008, when the banks were falling like ninepins and required the helping hand of taxpayers. While savers have been squeezed by ultra-low interest rates, the rich have done well, helped by the actions taken by the Bank of England and other central banks to avert collapse, including large-scale asset purchases under quantitative easing.\par \par \uc2 The wealth of the 1,000 richest is equivalent to a third of Britain's annual gross domestic product, although interestingly it is only just over 5% of the latest official estimate of total household wealth, \u163\'00\'A39,515bn. The latest rise comes, however, at a time when it is not just savers who are feeling the squeeze. Average earnings are rising by more than inflation, but only just. The "hardworking families" beloved of politicians are still feeling the pinch.\par \par \uc2 We should put wealth in Britain in perspective. The combined wealth of the richest 1,000 is striking, as is the fact that according to the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  the wealthiest 10% of households own 44% of aggregate wealth. The rich are getting richer. You need wealth of \u163\'00\'A385m to gain a place on the Rich List today, compared with \u163\'00\'A340m a decade ago. The ONS notes that 10% of us are now millionaires as a result of property and pension wealth.\par \par \uc2 Although wealth is unevenly distributed, there is no evidence that it has become more unevenly spread in recent years: the ONS suggests wealth distribution is remarkably stable. The French economist Thomas Piketty has made waves with his Capital in the 21st Century, but Britain's wealth is more evenly spread than in most countries, including France. There is also, as \uc2 the Institute for Fiscal Studies\uc2  points out, an important life-cycle aspect to wealth. Younger people have more debt than wealth; older people build up money in pensions and housing equity.\par \par \uc2 The important aspect of the Rich List is what we can learn from it about the roots of success. Britain is no longer a nation of the landed gentry seeing the value of their country piles rise inexorably; of the fat cats growing ever fatter on the back of inheritance and the backs of the poor.\par \par \uc2 Instead, it is a picture of self-made millionaires and billionaires, many of whom have overcome educational disadvantage and personal setbacks \u8212\'20\'14 including poverty and the loss of a parent \u8212\'20\'14 to succeed. Most eschewed cosy normality, taking risks and putting their livelihoods on the line in their determination to succeed.\par \par \uc2 If Britain is to be successful in the 21st century we need the Rich List to be the tip of a large iceberg. Beneath the top 1,000, in other words, we need tens of thousands of others seeking to emulate them.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, that appears to be the case. Nearly two decades ago John Major attracted some ridicule by declaring that Britain should be the enterprise centre of Europe. But it was a laudable aim and on many measures it has been achieved. Other countries in Europe can only envy the fact that this nation of shopkeepers is indeed becoming a nation of entrepreneurs.\par \par \uc2 That, of course, is never guaranteed.\par \par \uc2 The Labour party's anti-business agenda and UKIP's anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rhetoric have the capacity to do damage. Britain needs to be seen as a place where success is applauded, not one characterised by the tall poppy syndrome and a mistrust of foreigners. The Rich List celebrates success. Our politicians need to do so too.\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140518ea5i000lw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

\par\par \uc2 Features\par \b \uc2 Touching the void\b0\par\par\uc2 Jonathan Dean   \par \uc2 1,486 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Times\par \uc2 ST\par \uc2 1; National\par 16,17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Times Newspapers Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 One of the great songwriters, Conor Oberst is also a fierce critic of our empty internet age. He explains why to Jonathan Dean\par \par \uc2 There's something delicate about Conor Oberst, as if he's a tall, talking porcelain doll. On record, the Bright Eyes singer's lyrics touch on love, but often crack under fear. In person, he's pale, sinking deep into an armchair and speaking quickly, but quietly. He sets a Dictaphone on the table. This is rare in rock, whose stars tend, unthinkingly, to just let it all out. Last year, though, he was accused of rape, and is in turn suing for libel. When a fire alarm blares out \u8212\'20\'14 "That's terrifying!" \u8212\'20\'14 he covers his ears and mimes a scream, as if it's the last noise he can bear.\par \par \uc2 Last December, a commenter wrote on a message board that, 10 years ago, this alleged assault took place. It topped \uc2 Google\uc2  searches for Oberst's name for months, and, while I'm not allowed to ask about the case, it speaks volumes about how quickly the internet can judge, and damage, anyone \u8212\'20\'14 accuser or accused.\par \par \uc2 Tomorrow, though, brings his first music without a backing band since Oberst, now 34, was a teenager; before his words were quoted by Lorde and Jonathan Franzen; before he toured with Michael Stipe and Bruce Springsteen for Obama; before anyone called him the Dylan of the Ritalin generation.\par \par \uc2 Outside of Bright Eyes, he plays beach rock with the Mystic Valley Band and political punk with Desaparecidos \u8212\'20\'14 his Conortations, if you like \u8212\'20\'14 but this is the first time it's been just him, as the mature Conor Oberst. Alone. The result is the quiet, distant Upside Down Mountain. A line on the opener goes: "I want to walk in that howling wind/Till it scatters all my thoughts". He seeks escape at every turn.\par \par \uc2 We meet for coffee in London, on a day when Jo Whiley will tell him that his best-known song \u8212\'20\'14 First Day of My Life \u8212\'20\'14 is probably the track she has played most in her long career. He is used to such flattery. Stipe compares him to \uc2 Patti Smith\uc2 . He is namechecked in Richard Linklater's new film, Boyhood. I tell him that, when reading the CD booklet for an earlier album, I thought the lyrics must be bonus essays, such were the twists in narrative and turns of phrase. I thought there was no way such words could fit into songs. But they did.\par \par \uc2 "That's funny," he smiles. He keeps his hat on throughout, dark eyes fixed on mine, as if he's more worried than most about where questions may lead. "To me, what's still exciting is that I don't actually know how to write a song. People think this is bullshit, but it's not. There's still a big, mysterious part of it, and I like that. It's about being patient.\par \par \uc2 "To me, my songs are closer to daydreams, letting your mind wander when nothing's going on, staring out of a window, going for a walk. That's when words, when that transmission starts coming."\par \par \uc2 His speech comes in a steady flow, recalling the soulful writing of David Foster Wallace \u8212\'20\'14 a source of pride to anyone who still thinks of Oberst as the voice of his generation, even if that generation has moved away from him. There's an interview he gave in January, and a quote \u8212\'20\'14 "I'm not going to sit on a f****** computer and try to talk to some f****** 16-year-old" \u8212\'20\'14 that he gave when asked about communicating with his fans. It feels pertinent, addressing how many of his peers, and those he was charged with speaking for, spend their time. "I feel like a very 20th-century person," he says, appropriately, before rolling into a lengthy monologue. Here are the edited highlights.\par \par \uc2 "Our age is the last to remember the world before the internet, and I'm happy I do. What is damaging to the human spirit is, we all have a void inside, and all want connection to other people, but our culture creates a false togetherness. We think we're filling the void when we're not. We're making it worse. To have 10 million friends on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , you're still alone at your laptop... Also, it's funny.\par \par \uc2 One critique about my music has been how selfabsorbed I am. But I look around at everyone on the street, and I'm, like, I took all of my self-absorption and made rock'n'roll for 20 years. Most of you have taken 20 pictures of yourself today and waited for someone to tap them and tell you, 'You're beautiful.' "To me, that's real selfabsorption. Everything is a spectator sport. I say, start a band, not a blog. Sell that to the kids. Make some music. Do some painting, make a film, do something of value. Don't just waste your life commenting on all this vapour blowing by you."\par \par \uc2 Oberst was born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1980, releasing his first album 13 years later, and fronting various bands. Bright Eyes landed a hit in 2005 with the near-perfect political folkrock of I'm Wide Awake It's Morning. At the time, on the Jay Leno show, at the height of \uc2 George W Bush\uc2 's presidency, he played the furious (non-album) track When the President Talks to God. His are the protest songs some older critics insist modern artists don't offer. He has also released songs about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  rights in Arizona, the whistleblower Chelsea Manning and fur.\par \par \uc2 He went on the road for Obama, met the man and says, sadly: "I don't want to say that he broke my heart, but..." Last year he wrote a polemic for Chile with Desaparecidos. Why not America? He looks despondent, defeated. "If there's any superpower that's a candidate for utter, total collapse," he sighs, "we've got the recipe."\par \par \uc2 This, the acutely articulate passion on subjects people should care about, is why people love Oberst. Seriously, love him. I interviewed Steven Soderbergh in full flight, when he left film for ever, and he was easier to edit. Honest (he can't stand his old voice, "jumping octaves inexplicably") and funny ("Every record sold more than the last. Well, for a while"), he is, nevertheless, more timid than expected. I have spent a decade watching him woo crowds confidently, from grotty unions to rain-soaked Glastonbury. Maybe it's his new, mature, married life. Or maybe it's because he is dealing with the biggest controversy of an already noisy career. The key song on Upside Down Mountain seems to be the last one, Common Knowledge. Quiet but wordy, like its singer, it's a highlight that sits alongside old songs Going for the Gold, Lua or Milk Thistle; confessional snapshots of a life growing up. Except, this time, it's third person: he, not I. "Holds onto his mind just like a kite," goes a line, before continuing with lyrics that make him sound more removed than before, telling stories, not being the story. The album is simple and folky, as his best-loved ones are. Effortless, too, as on Night at Lake Unknown, which drifts the listener along to whichever still body of water Oberst is singing about. Somewhere far away, that's for sure.\par \par \uc2 He tried out "megalomaniac producers" for this record, people who would "really twist my will and be a bit domineering". But he wound up with friends again, in Los Angeles, Omaha and Nashville. I ask why he looked to outsiders, and what they would have brought. "They would make me have shorter songs," he replies. "Words that repeat more often, arrangements less homemade-sounding."\par \par \uc2 He doesn't like speculating too much on what hasn't happened. Instead, as he heads off to play on the radio \u8212\'20\'14 solo performances that receive an enthusiastic \uc2 Twitter\uc2  reception, which he won't read \u8212\'20\'14 I ask which song he is most proud of. There are nearly 300 of his on iTunes. He thinks, then picks the slow, slightly mystical Cape Canaveral, from 2008.\par \par \uc2 I listen to it again on the walk home, thinking about a friend who lives far away. It goes, "And you don't judge me/That's not your style/But I won't see you for a little while" \u8212\'20\'14 and, like the best lyrics, the ones in wedding vows and on tattoos, it works as well for the singer as the sung-to. It comes from arguably the best songwriter this century. From a head that is full of pressure, and one, I sense, its bearer would like a rest from for a while. c Upside Down Mountain is out tomorrow on Nonesuch\par \par \uc2 Our culture creates a false togetherness\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140518ea5i000h5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw166\pich47\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2490\pichgoal705

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 AT A GLANCE THE SNOW QUEEN by \uc2 MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM\uc2  Fourth Estate \u163\'00\'A316.99 ebook \u163\'00\'A311.39 pp258\par \par \uc2 FICTION\par \par \uc2 Some people turn to religion, and some turn to drugs. There is one of each in Cunningham's luminously written new novel, in which Barrett Meeks re-evaluates his life after he sees a strangely knowing and caring light hovering in the sky over Central Park, shortly after yet another romantic disappointment (where the kiss-off comes by text, "a crushingly corporate wish for good luck in the future, followed by three lowercase xxx's"). Meanwhile his brother Tyler, a musician with a terminally ill fianc\u233\'00\'E9e, finds that cocaine makes him feel alive and heroin helps him with his songwriting. Page-turningly enjoyable, this is a profound if slightly unresolved novel about love from a highly regarded, Pulitzer-winning novelist.\par \par \uc2 FAMILY LIFE by AKHIL SHARMA Faber \u163\'00\'A314.99/ebook \u163\'00\'A39.99 pp212\par \par \uc2 Sharma upset a lot of people with his debut novel, An Obedient Father, about incest and corruption in India. He has waited 14 years to produce his second, in which young \uc2 Ajay Mishra\uc2  and his family move from Delhi to New York. They prosper cautiously until a horrific swimming-pool tragedy strikes Ajay's elder brother, Birju, after which his father slides into alcoholism. Family Life reads like an autobiography \u8212\'20\'14 indeed, it is based on the author's own experience \u8212\'20\'14 and there is something likeable about Sharma's totally candid and unpretentious voice. The book is full of striking detail about Hindu culture, Ajay's feelings towards white people, and \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  experience in America. At the centre, though \u8212\'20\'14 with the long-term experience of brain damage, and the reality of nursing homes \u8212\'20\'14 it is irredeemably depressing.\par \par \uc2 ORFEO by RICHARD POWERS Atlantic \u163\'00\'A318.99/ebook \u163\'00\'A38.99 pp384\par \par \uc2 Mistakenly dialling the emergency services because his beloved dog is dying has terrible consequences for Peter Els, an avant-garde classical composer in Pennsylvania. The policemen who call are polite enough, but notice his hobby of microbiology (where's he's innocently looking for musical patterns in strands of DNA). Before he knows what's happening, government agents in biohazard suits are emptying his house and exhuming the dog. Based on the real-life case of Steve Kurtz, a "bio-artist" who went through four years of hell with the \uc2 FBI\uc2 , Powers's study of American paranoia post-9/11 alludes to Kafka and stays just the right side of overblown. The result is a virtuoso performance from an unashamedly heavy-duty novelist, determined to tell his fellow Americans more than they see on the news.\par \par \uc2 Phil Baker\par \par \uc2 Document ST00000020140518ea5i000gn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

What will you do to curb it further? What is your plan for the economy? What will you do to end the "something for nothing" culture? Will you guarantee a European referendum in the next Parliament? Will you pledge not to raise taxes to pay off the deficit after the next election? What is the best thing about the EU? What is the worst thing about the EU? Would you be happy to see more countries join the EU? Closer ties with EU or closer ties with the US? I want more people to have secure futures for themselves and their families. We've made progress with 1.5million more in work but there's more to do.\par \par \uc2 a We've cut non-EU net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  by a third and are doing more to tackle illegal \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and benefit tourism.\par \par \uc2 1. Cut deficit. 2. Cut income tax and freeze fuel duty. 3. Back businesses to create more jobs. 4. Cap welfare and reduce \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . 5. Better schools and skills.\par \par \uc2 We have capped benefits so no one claims more on welfare than the average working family earns. The key is to reward work.\par \par \uc2 Yes. There will be an in-out referendum in 2017 if I'm Prime Minister.\par \par \uc2 We've set out a plan to clear the deficit by cutting spending instead of putting up taxes.\par \par \uc2 The single market means British firms can trade with Europe, creating more jobs here and helping unemployment come down even further.\par \par \uc2 Too much is being decided in Brussels rather than in Britain. That's why getting real change and then a referendum is vital.\par \par \uc2 Yes but only with proper transitional controls so we do not have a repeat of Labour's past mistakes on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Strong relationships with both but a better deal for Britain in the EU. We also need to trade more with rising nations such as China and India so we create more jobs.\par \par \uc2 Tackle the cost of living crisis with an energy price freeze, better childcare and building homes for the next generation.\par \par \uc2 We want stronger border checks, longer controls when countries join the EU and tougher rules to stop wages being undercut.\par \par \uc2 Big reforms of banks and apprenticeships - and action on jobs, wages and prices so that our economy works for everyone, not just a few.\par \par \uc2 A compulsory jobs guarantee for the under-25s, tackling tax avoidance and ensuring all employers pay the minimum wage.\par \par \uc2 There will be an in-out referendum if power is transferred from the UK to the EU. But my priority if I become PM is the cost-of-living crisis and our \uc2 NHS\uc2 , not exiting Europe.\par \par \uc2 I want to keep taxes as low as possible and we will have a new 10p starting rate of tax and reduce the deficit with a 50p rate on incomes over \u163\'00\'A3150,000.\par \par \uc2 Millions of British people benefit from the trade and jobs created.\par \par \uc2 The way money is spent in the European budget. More of it should be spent on creating a better economy.\par \par \uc2 Yes. But I want fairer rules, such as making people from new countries wait longer before they can work here.\par \par \uc2 I want close ties with both. Britain should never turn its back on the world.\par \par \uc2 The weather.\par \par \uc2 We are building an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system which is firm but fair.\par \par \uc2 But we must do more, which is why I want proper border checks to count people out as well as in.\par \par \uc2 The Lib Dems are the only party who will finish the job of fixing our economy, unlike Labour, but finish it fairly, unlike the Tories.\par \par \uc2 We are changing the welfare system to make sure work always pays, those that need help get it - but not benefits with no questions asked.\par \par \uc2 We are the first Government ever to pass a law guaranteeing there will be a referendum if new powers are transferred from Britain to Brussels.\par \par \uc2 No. We believe the richest should pay their fair share. But we will carry on cutting taxes for ordinary workers.\par \par \uc2 Three things - jobs, jobs, jobs.\par \par \uc2 The farcical monthly trek between Brussels and Strasbourg. The Lib Dems are leading the charge to end this circus. Ukip hasn't lifted a finger.\par \par \uc2 Only if they meet high standards on the rule of law, democracy and human rights and we keep stronger transitional controls on movement of people.\par \par \uc2 Both - not either/or. We stand tall in the US because we stand tall in our own backyard. Trade talks between EU and US will bring up to \u163\'00\'A310billion a year. If we leave, we lose it.\par \par \uc2 No mystery - I'd like us to become a self-governing country again by quitting the EU.\par \par \uc2 It's actually more than 200,000! We'd have an Aussie-style points system to control volume and quality. This can only be done outside of the EU.\par \par \uc2 We need lower taxes and a smaller State. We have to let people keep more of the cash they earn.\par \par \uc2 My basic principle - young people of able body and mind shouldn't get a subsidy without doing something in return.\par \par \uc2 I want an in-out EU referendum right now. I'm fed up with being offered jam tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 Yes. We will set out in our manifesto ways to cut public spending. Taxes are already too high.\par \par \uc2 Nothing - although many of its member countries are great places.\par \par \uc2 That it has turned itself into a superstate making most of our laws and undermining our democracy.\par \par \uc2 I'd be happy if every country left.

All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NO ONE ever asked the British people if we wanted our country changed out of all recognition.\par \par \uc2 Forty years ago, they asked us if we wanted to be part of a common market with our European neighbours.\par \par \uc2 Eager to be part of a peaceful, prosperous continent, millions of us voted yes \u8212\'20\'14 including a boy from Billericay with a Rod Stewart feather cut.\par \par \uc2 I was voting for the very first time. And half a lifetime down the road, I would STILL vote to be part of a common market.\par \par \uc2 But what no one in this country EVER signed up to was a loss of our national sovereignty, laws imposed by unelected foreign leaders and our borders thrown open to 27 European nations (so far).\par \par \uc2 When did we vote for any of that? Never.\par \par \uc2 Keep that in mind when you vote in the European elections this coming Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Remember that freedoms fought for by generations have been casually peed away by a political elite who never asked the British people if this was what we wanted.\par \par \uc2 For those of us who would not wipe our dogs on the EU flag, UKIP's endless controversies are an unwanted distraction from the real debate.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday's headlines were not about the denial of an EU referendum for 40 years \u8212\'20\'14 they were about Nigel Farage's comments that most British people would not want a house full of Romanians moving next door.\par \par \uc2 Is that racist or the brutal truth? It is a bit of both. But certainly the political establishment would much rather we were talking about outrageous racism rather than the outrageous democracy deficit at the heart of the EU. The controversy around UKIP is a way of stifling real debate about our future.\par \par \uc2 'There is nothing loony about that' We have heard a lot about the fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists of UKIP. And UKIP deserves to have a light shone on its fruitcake tendency who think that God sent the floods to punish us for gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 But the central policy of UKIP is that our country would be better off outside the EU. And there is nothing loony about that.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband are all singing from the same songbook on the EU. They all promise a referendum somewhere down the line when powers are transferred to Brussels. But that has already happened.\par \par \uc2 And denying the British people a chance to object in an EU referendum is gobbing in the eye of democracy. I feel under no obligation to prove my non-racist credentials to anyone. I live in a mixed-race family. There are two languages spoken in our house. My wife came to this country and made it her home.\par \par \uc2 I am totally in favour of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , if someone has something to contribute.\par \par \uc2 But let's have our borders open to the doctor from India, the teacher from New Zealand and the engineer from Japan. Not just anyone who has a crappy little EU passport.\par \par \uc2 For years the political elite has tried to smear ordinary British patriots as fruitcakes, loonies and racists.\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  called Gillian Duffy (a lifelong Labour supporter) a "bigoted woman" in 2010 for daring to mention EU \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , he was only saying what they all believe.\par \par \uc2 We are led by second-rate men with first-class educations who know nothing of the real world. They despise the British people. Brown spoke for the lot of them. Remember that when you vote on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 In my heart and bones I do not believe the European elections will be decided by loonies, fruitcakes and closet racists. I think they will be decided by people who love their country.\par \par \uc2 And who want it back.\par \par \uc2 ? I WAS in lovely Aberdeen last weekend and came away feeling less certain that you Scots are going to vote for independence. But if David Cameron wants to preserve the Union, the best thing he can do is keep his cakehole shut.\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140518ea5i000jr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The EU elections promise everything to lose\b0\par\par\uc2 By Iain Martin   \par \uc2 1,778 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par 08:00\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 This week's European elections will reflect the way the political wind is blowing ahead of next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election. What will be the cost of a poor result?\par \par \uc2 The European elections are not meant to be exciting and unpredictable. Only about a third of Britons vote to choose their Member of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  twice a decade, and in a normal year the losing parties say, with some justification, that the outcome does not really matter.\par \par \uc2 This time it is different. All the British parties involved go into this week\u8217\'20\'19s European and local elections knowing that the result is difficult to predict and that, for once, the contest counts because of its potential impact on the general election in under a year\u8217\'20\'19s time.\par \par \uc2 Voters are also going to the polls this Thursday in local elections in 161 of England and Northern Ireland\u8217\'20\'19s local authorities, but the Euros are the much bigger test \u8211\'20\'13 all UK voters can have their say at the ballot box.\par \par \uc2 The parties approach the vote with trepidation \u8211\'20\'13 and\u160\'00\'A0no wonder. They all have a lot to lose in the first truly national test of public opinion since Ukip began its latest surge.\par \par \uc2 Having promised supporters a historic breakthrough this week, Ukip and its leader Nigel Farage must now deliver or face accusations that they have peaked. In contrast, the Tories want to avoid a difficult day for \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  turning into a rout.\par \par \uc2 Labour, which this close to a general election should be well advanced in establishing itself as a credible government in-waiting, is in trouble. If the party somehow slipped into third place behind Ukip and the Tories this week, it could even be fatal to Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s leadership.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Lib Dems are battling to stay in business. Leader Nick Clegg valiantly tried to take on Mr Farage in two televised debates. The result was a kicking for Mr Clegg and a further boost for Ukip.\par \par \uc2 Thursday\u8217\'20\'19s vote \u8211\'20\'13 the results of which are announced next Sunday evening \u8211\'20\'13 also raises the curtain on an extraordinary period of potential instability that stretches well beyond the general election. The Euros will be followed in September by a referendum that could mean Scotland breaking up the United Kingdom. Shortly after that, in May, comes a general election likely to be the most closely fought in a generation. Then, if the Tories somehow hold on to power, there is due to be a complex renegotiation of Britain\u8217\'20\'19s terms of membership of the \uc2 European Union\uc2  followed by an in/out EU referendum.\par \par \uc2 Against a backdrop of populist anger aimed at mainstream politicians and institutions, it is clear that the established parties are in a spin and confused about what to do next.\par \par \uc2 The economic recovery that is under way might conventionally presage an equally strong revival in the electoral fortunes of the governing parties. Certainly, the Tory position has improved relative to that of Labour, as illustrated by the latest Sunday Telegraph ICM Wisdom Index, which today suggests that, by a narrow margin, voters expect the Tories to win.\par \par \uc2 Twice in the last week, Labour has also dipped behind the Tories in opinion polls on the state of the parties. But other polls have continued to put Labour in front and the Conservatives are not recording anything approaching the large leads they need for a Commons majority. Thanks to the vagaries of the election system, the Tories require to be as much as five to seven points in front of Labour on general election day.\par \par \uc2 Labour high command has its own serious problems. Ordinarily, a split on the Right, with Ukip draining support from the Tories, would be a cause for cheer on the Left. Instead, there is concern that Ukip is also attracting disillusioned working-class Labour voters.\par \par \uc2 Divisions have emerged in those around Mr Miliband on how this should be handled. Should the party attack Ukip or concentrate on the Tories along with trying to hold on to the Lib Dem voters who defected to Labour after Mr Clegg took his party into coalition?\par \par \uc2 Michael Dugher MP, who is in charge of Labour\u8217\'20\'19s day-to-day campaigning, unleashed a ferocious attack on Ukip last week. Yet \uc2 Douglas Alexander\uc2 , the party\u8217\'20\'19s general election co-ordinator, has been sceptical that attacks on Mr Farage will make a difference.\par \par \uc2 This was the unpromising situation when Barack Obama\u8217\'20\'19s election guru arrived in London for a flying visit. He has been hired by the Labour leader to help. However, David Axelrod soon managed to misspell Ed Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s name on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . In private meetings, his main message was that Labour is getting it right in terms of its policies; it just needs to be a little better organised \u8211\'20\'13 analysis that sounds over-optimistic.\par \par \uc2 If Labour has the right policies \u8211\'20\'13 or any policies \u8211\'20\'13 it should probably consider telling the voters soon what they are. Yesterday, a Labour MP was despairing: \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t know what we\u8217\'20\'19re for or what Ed Miliband is trying to say, do you? If it carries on like this, the Tories are going to win in 2015 with a majority.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Labour\u8217\'20\'19s confusion is further testament to the impact of Mr Farage. A member of the shadow cabinet says: \u8220\'20\'1CFarage has cracked open a sewer about how people feel about politicians in general. It\u8217\'20\'19s an anti-politics vote. The depth of alienation is extraordinary.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Regardless of the result next week, the Ukip leader\u8217\'20\'19s achievement is remarkable. He has turned a rag-tag party, with very little infrastructure or party organisation and some highly eccentric candidates, into a fighting force that may well top the poll in Thursday\u8217\'20\'19s elections. In terms of campaigning on the national stage, he has managed this with little support, working long hours and campaigning across the country.\par \par \uc2 Ukip stands on the verge of a breakthrough in the Euros. The party is certainly set to improve on its performance in the equivalent elections five years ago. Then, with \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2  in office and the global financial crisis under way, Ukip came second with 16.5\u160\'00\'A0per cent of the vote behind the Tories on 27.7 per cent, while Labour slumped to third.\par \par \uc2 Since then, Mr Farage has showed himself adept at exploiting unease over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and the EU. He has also capitalised on Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s weaknesses by appealing to Tories who oppose the recent gay-marriage legislation. One of the most recent polls, by ComRes, for the European elections, put Ukip on 34 per cent, Labour on 24 per cent, the Tories on 22 per cent and the Lib Dems on 8\u160\'00\'A0per cent.\par \par \uc2 But the strain of going full throttle in this campaign does seem to be telling on the Ukip man. On Thursday, in a radio interview on LBC, he was put under intense pressure and in response pressed what his enemies hope was the self-destruct button.\par \par \uc2 Asked about Romanians moving next door, he said people would feel uncomfortable. The interviewer then asked him what the difference would be if the new neighbours were German. Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s wife is German.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou know the difference,\u8221\'20\'1D he responded. The implication was that the Romanians are to be feared simply because of their nationality or race.\par \par \uc2 There were other questions that Mr Farage handled badly. Having said recently that he felt uncomfortable on hearing fellow passengers on a London commuter train speak languages other than English, he acknowledged that his wife speaks German at home.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the interview was going so badly that \uc2 Patrick O\u8217\'20\'19Flynn\uc2 , Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s head of communications, intervened to try to end it. If the Prime Minister\u8217\'20\'19s press secretary or Mr Miliband\u8217\'20\'19s spin-doctor had tried to halt a live interview, it would surely be cited by Ukip supporters as evidence of control-freakery. Mr O\u8217\'20\'19Flynn claimed that he stepped in because the interview was over-running the time agreed. Opponents said that he realised that it was a car crash and moved to stop\u160\'00\'A0it.\par \par \uc2 The LBC interview duly went viral on the internet. And yesterday, the Sun, a newspaper that shares Mr Farage\u8217\'20\'19s concerns about uncontrolled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , accused him of racism. \u8220\'20\'1CIt is not racist to worry about the impact of millions of migrants on Britain, as we have for years. It is racist to smear Romanians just for being Romanians. Nigel Farage, Ukip leader, did just that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The incident is unlikely to cost Ukip in the European elections \u8211\'20\'13 most voters will have missed the LBC interview and even the resulting news reports. But Ukip will have a longer-term problem if the voters it has attracted conclude that Mr Farage is incompetent at managing his party or controlling its wilder elements.\par \par \uc2 Such perceptions may already exist. Tories say that when they ask voters about other parties, concern about the \u8220\'20\'1Cunpleasantness\u8221\'20\'1D of some Ukip attitudes features highly.\par \par \uc2 The Tory leadership is already preparing to make its pitch in the days after the vote to those voters who are abandoning the Conservatives for Ukip in the European elections. They are wary of dismissing the rise of Mr Farage as a protest vote, because it sounds unduly dismissive. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople vote for protest parties because they think there is something worth protesting about,\u8221\'20\'1D said a senior Tory source.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe get it. We will be saying we understand your frustration. But we have to explain that the next election is the one that matters. The question to people is 'Who do you want to govern?\u8217\'20\'19\u8201\'20\'09\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 After the Euros, there is the Newark by-election on June 5. Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s Roger Helmer hopes to become the party\u8217\'20\'19s first MP at Westminster. The Tories are cautiously optimistic that a majority of 16,152 is too large for Ukip to overhaul, although in by-elections held in difficult circumstances for a governing party anything is possible.\par \par \uc2 Once Newark has voted, the Prime Minister is expected to announce a Cabinet reshuffle. He wants to bring in more of the next Tory generation ahead of the general election. Then, with the economy growing, the Tory high command hopes to go into the autumn party conference presenting Mr Miliband as a menace, while trying to convince former Tory Ukippers to \u8220\'20\'1Ccome home\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 This week\u8217\'20\'19s elections will reveal how far its recent surge has taken Ukip. The Tories will then be able to assess just how many disaffected voters they need to win over in time for 2015. What is clear already is that Mr Farage has managed to spook the established parties very badly indeed.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140518ea5i000rw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 With Mr Sajid Javid\u8217\'20\'19s good sense, the Tories can win\b0\par\par\uc2 By Telegraph View   \par \uc2 627 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par 08:00\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 The Conservatives must capitalise on the economic recovery - and the new Culture Secretary knows how\par \par \uc2 Next week\u8217\'20\'19s European elections may well be the most anticipated and discussed in history. The rise of Ukip has added a fascinating frisson to a contest to which many voters usually pay little attention, and the performance of the party could have a profound effect upon the next general election. It has been predicted by some that Ukip will come first, dragging the centre ground of British politics dramatically to the Right. That Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s party can continue to dominate the polls in spite of myriad accusations of bigotry is a remarkable testament to the public\u8217\'20\'19s disaffection with politics-as-usual.\par \par \uc2 However, things could turn out rather differently than expected. Our latest poll shows that the Tories have overtaken Ukip to enter second place in a hypothetical European election contest. This is a big turnaround from just one month ago, when the Tories were placed a distant third and Labour and Ukip were battling for first. The change is probably a recognition of the Government\u8217\'20\'19s improving fortunes. The economy is growing fast, unemployment is declining, and \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from Romania and Bulgaria has actually fallen since labour market restrictions were lifted, contrary to Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s predictions. The good news is reflected, too, in general election polling. Our survey gives the Tories 31.4 per cent vs Labour\u8217\'20\'19s 30.7 per cent. Hardly a landslide margin, but part of a trend of public sentiment moving steadily in \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s favour.\par \par \uc2 Of course, the Conservatives cannot afford to be complacent. One of the reasons why the Ukip rebellion has happened is that a disconnect loomed between the party leadership and traditional Tory voters frustrated by recession and the slow pace of change. To win in 2015, Mr Cameron has to win back his base and convince floating voters that the Conservatives will make a real, material difference to them and their families.\par \par \uc2 One man who seems to understand this is Sajid Javid, the new Culture Secretary. He is a welcome antidote to the Westminster insider image \u8211\'20\'13 a comprehensive school boy, the son of a bus driver of British-Pakistani descent, who made his fortune in the private sector. And he speaks a lot of common sense. In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, he addresses the thorny issue of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , arguing that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  must learn English and \u8220\'20\'1Crespect our way of life\u8221\'20\'1D. He also admits frankly that there is no control over numbers coming in from the EU and that the best way to tackle this is through renegotiation of our relationship with Brussels ahead of an in/out referendum.\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid adds that the failure to redraw parliamentary boundaries will make it harder for the Tories to win next year\u8217\'20\'19s general election. This means that the Conservatives have to build a substantial lead over Labour if there is to be any hope of commanding a Commons majority: they cannot afford to throw away the opportunities afforded them by this economic recovery or the signs of growing popular goodwill. If people sense that taxes are going down and that they have more money in their pockets, or that the Government is determined to control our borders better, they will give their votes to Mr Cameron.\par \par \uc2 Day after day, it becomes clearer that the Labour Party is simply not a fit alternative. Whatever happens to Ukip next week, the real contest in 2015 is going to be between Conservative realists such as Mr Javid and economically irresponsible Left-wingers like Mr Miliband. It is a contest that we cannot afford to see the Tories lose.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140518ea5i000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage is toxifying the debate on Europe and undermining his own cause, says Bill Cash MP\par \par \uc2 The biggest asset that EU-integrationists like Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have is Ukip.\par \par \uc2 Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s hope is that they can succeed in splitting the Euro-realist vote and, by taking enough votes in Conservative marginals to prevent a majority Conservative government from being elected to renegotiate our membership of the EU, to legislate to change EU laws and our EU relationship and to give the British people a say in an in/out referendum.\par \par \uc2 Many people do not know this but to have a referendum at all, a Bill for this has first to be passed by a majority in the House of Commons to pay for it.\par \par \uc2 On their leaflets, Ukip claim: "Only Ukip will take back control." How? They don\u8217\'20\'19t have one MP, let alone a majority in the Commons.\par \par \uc2 That fact was underlined in the lobbies of Parliament earlier this year, when Labour and Liberal Democrat peers conspired with some of their colleagues in the House of Commons to kill James Wharton\u8217\'20\'19s exclusively Conservative EU Referendum Bill, which I helped to draft.\par \par \uc2 But for them, there would now be a Conservative referendum Act. Ukip were nowhere.\par \par \uc2 Worse still, even before a single vote is cast in the 2015 general election, Nigel Farage is causing untold damage to the cause of opposition to European political integration. He is the problem. By his divisive rhetoric he is toxifying the debate. Furthermore, by undermining Conservative marginals, he is trying to destroy the only party which will deliver a majority for the cause he claims to champion. He is his own worst enemy.\par \par \uc2 His interview on LBC radio on Friday was a case in point. It was an unedifying and, at times, a shocking listen.\par \par \uc2 Under robust questioning from the host, James O\u8217\'20\'19Brien, Mr Farage implied that \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  in Britain commuting home from work ought to think twice before they speak their own first language on the train.\par \par \uc2 He claimed that you "know" what the difference is between living next-door to a German family and a Romanian family. What next?\par \par \uc2 He has claimed in the past that there is bound to be a culture of criminality among Romanians and that Britons should be wary of Romanian families moving into our streets.\par \par \uc2 All this in the same week that a young Asian Ukip activist resigned her membership of the party, claiming that Ukip has "descended into a form of racist populism".\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s not just over the airwaves that Nigel Farage, now the Del Boy of British politics, is casting a pall over this European election campaign.\par \par \uc2 Lurid Ukip posters loom out of billboards across the country. A giant pointing finger aims to put people in fear of their livelihoods. An actor poses as a builder made homeless by EU \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Amusingly, it transpired the actor was himself an \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  from Ireland. On a less savoury note, a UKIP activist posing as a builder in one of Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s recent election broadcasts was expelled from the party over a series of foul and racist \uc2 Twitter\uc2  posts.\par \par \uc2 This is not the kind of British debate that I and many others have taken part in over all these years, relentlessly shifting the argument against European integration.\par \par \uc2 Time and again, when we have taken on the EU-integrationists we have defeated them by analysis and argument. We have made our case by deploying facts and exposing falsehood, not by alarmist rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 This great, popular campaign has always been about protecting our British democracy and the hard-won freedoms which are our birth right, now and in the future.\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage claims to champion the same cause, but by taking the debate down the road he has embarked on, he is simply playing into the hands of our pro-European opponents once again.\par \par \uc2 Ukip like to present the question as being one between good and bad, light and shade, but what they do is to generate a dark, reactionary Euro-phobia.\par \par \uc2 Our case has always been made on the moderate, common ground in line with British democratic values. Nigel Farage\u8217\'20\'19s divisive and increasingly nasty campaign risks poisoning the well of this crucial and truly patriotic debate.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140518ea5i000p3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

I do. We offer real changes on housing, so that there is a fairer deal for those who rent and there are more homes for people to buy.\par \par \uc2 Real changes to wages and taxes, so that hard work always pays.\par \par \uc2 Real changes to jobs, so that people aren't stuck on zero hours or low pay.\par \par \uc2 Real changes to Europe and rules on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , so that it works for working Britain.\par \par \uc2 And real changes on gas and electricity with a price freeze, so families can better make ends meet.\par \par \uc2 I hope you will support us on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 AND ANSWERS SIX KEY QUESTIONS FROM THE QWhat is the appeal of Nigel Farage and F UKIP to those Labour voters who will support him this week? Would you go for a pint with him? AI would have a pint with Nigel Farage - to tell him he is wrong. He promises tax cuts for the rich and massive tax rises for everyone else. He would charge to visit a GP. He would strip away basic rights at work including maternity pay. And he pretends we can leave Europe without destroying millions of jobs.\par \par \uc2 QYou must be worried Labour's lead in the polls You must be worried Labour's lead in the polls Yhas shrunk drastically. \u166\'00\'A6 Are you to blame? APolls go up and down. But most people don't worry about polls. They just know whether they're up or down in their real-life struggle.\par \par \uc2 QHow can you address inequality when half of UK wealth is owned by the richest 10 per cent? wealth is owned by the richest 10 per cent? ABy making the big changes Britain needs: Reforming our banks, revolutionising education and training for the forgotten 50 per cent who don't go to university and ensuring greater fairness in our economy.\par \par \uc2 QWhat do you make of the poisonous feud that has erupted between David Cameron and Nick Clegg and their allies over issues like education? AThey both signed up to policies which are draining money out of schools to pay for their pet projects. They are like two peas in a pod.\par \par \uc2 QYou have admitted that you have made You have admitted that you have made Ymistakes on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . How would you do things differently if you were PM? ABetter border checks, longer controls on new countries joining Europe, restricting rights to benefits when people come here, stopping recruitment agencies hiring only from abroad and - most importantly - tackling the exploitative practices like low pay and zero-hours contracts that lead to the undercutting of wages and conditions of workers already here.\par \par \uc2 QIn four words, why should anyone vote Labour in the local and Euro elections this week? can do better.\par \par \uc2 ABritain\par \par \uc2 Document SMIRR00020140518ea5i000hi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

He warned: "UKIP want to remove protection at work to make it easier for unscrupulous bosses to hire cheaper migrant labour." GMB boss Paul Kenny said the party would take working people back to the "dark ages" with the ideas in its Small Business Manifesto.\par \par \uc2 On the \uc2 NHS\uc2 , the party would let GPs "charge a flat fee", according to one of its senior figures.\par \par \uc2 For BANKERS, UKIP has hinted at even higher bonuses. In response to the storm over their pay and perks, former City trader Mr Farage said: "We don't need official caps or limits." On the ECONOMY, UKIP would make huge cuts on top of the Coalition's austerity laws. The party has said it wants big cuts to FOREIGN AID while the HS2 high-speed rail link, GREEN TAXES and WIND TURBINES would all be scrapped.\par \par \uc2 However, UKIP insisted many "older" policies had been axed. A spokesman said: "We will be publishing a new manifesto."\par \par \uc2 For this week's Euro elections, the party promises a referendum on quitting THE EU and a ban on \b \uc2 IMMIGRANTS\b0 \uc2  claiming benefits or using the \uc2 NHS\uc2  or state schools for five years.\par \par \uc2 Document SMIRR00020140518ea5i000cb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 News; Opinion; Columns\par \b \uc2 These weird Euro elections are the sunset of democracy\b0\par\par\uc2 689 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 3; National\par 24\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 verything is weird about this week's Euro-election, and nothing weirder than the possibility that the party that comes top of the poll will be one that hasn't got a single seat in Parliament. Our other parliament, in Brussels and Strasbourg, plays an important part in producing a huge proportion of the laws we must all obey. Yet on Thursday we shall only be choosing a bunch of unknown nonentities to represent us there, commanding just 9 per cent of the votes that can pass or reject those laws - and, hardly surprisingly, the majority of the British electorate will not even bother to turn out to vote for something they don't begin to understand.\par \par \uc2 We look askance at what the major parties tell us this election is all about. Mr Miliband tells us we should vote for him because he will freeze energy prices, which he has done more than anyone to put up; Mr Clegg tells us we should vote for him, because the Lib Dems are the only party that will keep us in the EU; Mr Cameron tells us that his is the only party that will give us the chance to vote in a referendum to leave it, although he says there is no way he could ever support a vote for us getting out.\par \par \uc2 The central figure of this campaign has been Nigel Farage, which is why the press and the media have devoted so much coverage to vilifying him. I go back a long way with Mr Farage. We have often spoken on platforms together since 1994, when he was already the star performer for a Ukip that had barely got off the ground. Just before the 1997 election, he invited me to give the keynote speech at Ukip's first national conference. In 1999, I accompanied him to Strasbourg, shortly after his election as one of the party's first three MEPs, to report on just what a strange, unreal madhouse the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  was, housed in a building that was like a cross between a Kafka novel and a Fritz Lang film.\par \par \uc2 But if one issue has dominated this present, equally unreal campaign, it has been that symbolised in Ukip's election leaflet, showing a beaming Mr Farage under the headline: "Our politicians have allowed open-door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  - Only Ukip Will Take Back Control." This is as empty a pledge as Mr Cameron's about that 2017 referendum, which can never happen. There is no way Ukip or anyone else can take back control of our borders so long as we wish to continue trading with the EU's single market, with which our "open-door" policy is as inextricably linked as it is with our belonging to the \uc2 Council of Europe\uc2 , the UN and much else. The only way Britain could regain control over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  would be to break every kind of international agreement, and to slam the door on the world.\par \par \uc2 It is equally disturbing that a party founded on a desire to extricate us from the EU should have no properly workedout policy for how this could be done. Ask Ukip what are the practical steps whereby we could achieve a successful exit from the EU, and the answer is little more than a blank stare and empty platitudes.\par \par \uc2 The underlying reason, of course, why Ukip is likely to do well this week is that it is the only way in which we can express our anger and contempt for the entire political class, which we feel has betrayed us, lost in its bubble of trivial and meaningless make-believe. It is for that reason alone that, joining so many others across Europe flocking to support EUsceptic parties, I will vote for them. But I shall do so well aware that this is only a gesture - all that is left to us as we see what remains of our democracy gurgling further down the plughole, and in the sad but sure knowledge that where there is no vision, the people must eventually perish.\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140518ea5i000ab\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \b \uc2 IMMIGRANTS\b0 \uc2  MUST learn English and "respect our way of life", the new Culture Secretary says today as he criticises migrants who have lived here for years, but still cannot speak the language.\par \par \uc2 In an exclusive interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Sajid Javid says voters have legitimate fears over "excessive" \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and are justified in wanting Britain to have more control over its borders.\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid, the first Asian Secretary of State, defends Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party, against charges of racism but insists that only the Conservatives can deliver the reforms to \uc2 European Union\uc2  laws needed to cut \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "People want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right," Mr Javid, who is the son of Pakistani \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , says.\par \par \uc2 "People also say, when \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  do come to Britain, that they should come to work, and make a contribution and that they should also respect our way of life, and I agree with all of that. It means things like trying to learn English."\par \par \uc2 The tough message on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , coming from Britain's highest-ranking Asian MP, who is also the Minister for Equalities, will provoke debate on controls to migration in a crucial week of elections.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, voters go to the polls across the UK to elect MEPs for the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 . Elections are also being held in 161 English council areas. \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  is a key battleground in the current campaign and will be central to all parties' manifestos in the run up to the general election.\par \par \uc2 In other developments today: \u222\'00\'DEAn ICM/Sunday Telegraph poll shows the Tories have overtaken Ukip in the running for the European elections and now lie in second place. They have also taken a 0.7 point lead over Labour in a separate general election poll. \u222\'00\'DENick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, says more coalitions are "inevitable", declaring that the era of twoparty dominance is over. Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, the Liberal Democrat leader says the Coalition "will last" until polling day next May, despite "stark and fiercely held" differences and "intense argument" between the Tories and Lib Dems.\par \par \uc2 \u222\'00\'DEIn his interview, Mr Javid also expresses deep concern over The Sunday Telegraph's disclosures of an alleged plot by radical Muslims to "Islamise" state schools in Birmingham. He goes on to warn that there is "no place" for Islamic law in the English legal system, after reports that Sharia courts have been established in parts of London and the Midlands. At present, most migrants applying for British citizenship are required to provide evidence of their English language skills, unless they are over-65 or have a long-term medical condition that prevents them doing so.\par \par \uc2 However, there is no requirement on EU migrants to be fluent in English and they are free to travel to the UK to work whenever they choose.\par \par \uc2 In his interview, Mr Javid suggests that some \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  who are already wellestablished in the UK also need to take greater responsibility for integrating with the rest of society.\par \par \uc2 "I know people myself, I have met people who have been in Britain for over 50 years and they still can't speak English," he says.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's perfectly reasonable for British people to say, look, if you're going to settle in Britain and make it your home, you should learn the language of the country and you should respect its laws and its culture."\par \par \uc2 The minister insists that the "vast majority" of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  want to integrate with the rest of society. The Conservatives have set a target for reducing Continued on Page 4 Continued from Page 1 net migration - the difference between how many people move to the UK and the number that leave each year \u8212\'20\'14 to the tens of thousands by the time of next year's election. Latest figures saw a rise of 212,000, driven partly by the number arriving from Romania and Bulgaria, the EU's two poorest countries. One minister suggested last week that the party was on course to miss this target.\par \par \uc2 Mr Javid defends the target but concedes that it is impossible to control levels of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  from Europe under current EU laws.\par \par \uc2 "Currently we don't have control of our borders within the EU and that's why we need fundamental reform," he says. One option would be to ban migrants from poor countries arriving until their country's wealth levels have risen, "so that you don't have these vast migrations that take place from poorer countries to richer countries in the EU".\par \par \uc2 The controversy over Ukip's stance on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , and the views of many of its candidates, continued yesterday. Nigel Farage spoke out to reject accusations that his party was racist and attempted to defend his claim that families should be concerned about Romanians moving in next door.\par \par \uc2 "Ukip will never allow the false accusation of racism levelled by a politically correct elite to prevent the raising of issues that are of concern to the great majority of the British public," he said.\par \par \uc2 "The unfortunate reality is that we are in political union with a post-Communist country that has become highly susceptible to organised crime."\par \par \uc2 The Ukip leader also said that "any normal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door".\par \par \uc2 In his interview with The Sunday Telegraph, however, Mr Javid said he did not believe Mr Farage was racist. "Do they have some candidates who have racist views? Of course, and we have seen some evidence of that recently," he says. "But I don't think they are a racist party and I don't think Nigel Farage is racist. I have met him and I don't think that at all."\par \par \uc2 Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, told yesterday's Daily Telegraph that he also believed that Mr Farage was not racist.\par \par \uc2 Their comments are likely to be seen as an effort by the Tory leadership to woo Ukip's supporters by refusing to join the chorus of outrage directed at Mr Farage.\par \par \uc2 However, Bill Cash, a leading Tory Eurosceptic MP, said yesterday that Mr Farage's party was undermining Conservative chances in marginal seats, which could deny the party a Commons majority next year and prevent \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  holding a referendum on Europe. Mr Cash claimed Mr Farage was doing "untold damage" to the Eurosceptic cause and "toxifying the debate" with his divisive rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 Michael Fallon\uc2 , the Tory energy minister, suggested his party would campaign to leave the EU if Mr Cameron's negotiations in Brussels failed to deliver a better deal for Britain.\par \par \uc2 He told the BBC: "If we don't get the reforms we want, yes of course the Government will then recommend a 'no' vote ... but we're not going into these negotiations planning to concede defeat. We think we can get these reforms."\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140518ea5i000a0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 Editorial\par \b \uc2 It's not the Euros, but the PM's response that counts\b0\par\par\uc2 MATTHEW D'ANCONA   \par \uc2 1,270 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Are you a tamarin or a marmoset? A curious question for a sultry May weekend, I know. But it is prompted by an intriguing 2005 paper in Biology Letters, a journal published by the Royal Society.\par \par \uc2 In summary, the authors discovered that the common marmoset was better than the cotton-top tamarin at deferring gratification in order to obtain a larger quantity of food. They waited. The tamarins, in contrast, grabbed what pellets they could, as soon as they could. There is, in other words, a scientific basis for the quality of patience. As it happens, the explanation in the case of these little primates seems to be that the marmoset depends on gum, a product for which they have to wait, whereas tamarins feed on insects, which they seize when they can.\par \par \uc2 We live in a tamarin society: thanks to Amazon Prime, Netflix, \uc2 Ocado\uc2  and other marvels of the digital revolution, we are growing used to instant gratification of our wants. To say the least, politicians fit uneasily in this new eco-sphere. The days when they commanded deference are long gone. Sleaze, spin and expenses have nurtured outright distaste and hostility towards the political class and the lethal charge - so essential to the Ukip insurgency - that "they're all the same". Very few political achievements worthy of memory are fast: even those that appear sudden and instantaneous, such as \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 's granting of independence to the Bank of England, are usually the end of a long process of subterranean debate and evolution. We expect a lot from politicians and the State.\par \par \uc2 But they do not deliver with the speed to which we have become accustomed in most other spheres. Representative democracy is not an app.\par \par \uc2 This is the context in which, a week today, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  will hear the results of the European elections. He will already know how his party has fared in 161 English local authorities (as well as the outcome in 11 new councils in Northern Ireland). But the European contest, in which all 46 million voters can take part, is much the greater test.\par \par \uc2 For a governing party taking painful measures, in the early stages of a recovery, a bad day in town hall elections is par for the course. But this year's election of 73 MEPs to represent the UK in Strasbourg has acquired a much deeper significance. It is Ed Miliband who should be sweating: as the man who hopes to be settling into No 10 a year from now, he has to trounce the Tories (and everyone else) in Thursday's elections.\par \par \uc2 Yet that is not the prism through which this race is generally being seen. It has become a battle between \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and Nigel Farage for the soul of the Right, the opening of a chasm, deep and wide, between enlightened and reactionary conservatism, between global interdependence and xenophobia, between control of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and fear of \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . On Friday, in an astonishing LBC interview, Farage said the following: "I was asked if a group of Romanian men moved in next door, would you be concerned? And if you lived in London, I think you would be." This, at least, is candid. I also think it is despicable. But some will applaud Farage to the rafters. This is a moment to choose, to stand up and be counted.\par \par \uc2 The strong likelihood is that Ukip will indeed beat the Conservatives in the European elections (not a certainty: today's poll suggests, for the first time, that the Tories might finish slightly ahead of Ukip). It may even top the poll outright, which, in purely psephological terms, would be a remarkable moment in contemporary political history. A guerrilla band of reactionary insurgents - a cult of personality, really - would have trounced the two giants of British politics, Labour and Conservative, exploiting fear, promoting anxiety and sharpening division to pull off an extraordinary underdog victory.\par \par \uc2 As soon as the results are announced - assuming Ukip defeats the Tories - the Prime Minister will find himself caught in a blizzard of hostile blog-posts, columns, analyses by learned pollsters, and editorials. Nobody will tell him to respond to Ukip's success by being more Right-wing. But that is what they will mean. The phrases "mainstream values", "bread-and-butter issues", "Westminster bubble", "metropolitan class" and "Dog and Duck" will be dependably deployed. Farage's defeat of Cameron will be attributed to same-sex marriage, environmentalism, the existence of the Coalition ("tail wagging the dog" will be the clich\u233\'00\'E9 rolled out in that instance). Failure may be an orphan but, in politics, it never lacks stern foster-parents telling it why it was left all alone.\par \par \uc2 The European elections are not a make-or-break moment for Cameron. But how he responds most certainly is. A politician whose party has suffered serious losses in any election must display humility and recognise the signal he or she has been sent by the electorate. The greater question is what the signal means.\par \par \uc2 In their excellent new book, The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race to Reinvent the State, \uc2 John Micklethwait\uc2  and Adrian Wooldridge argue persuasively that too much is expected of modern government, in a democratic culture that is both cynical and increasingly impatient. "Such cynicism might be healthy if people wanted little from the government," the authors say. "But they continue to want a great deal\u8230\'20\'26 The dependency forces government to overexpand and overburden itself while the disdain robs government of its legitimacy and turns every setback into a crisis."\par \par \uc2 Exactly so. They also quote Plato's greatest anxiety about democracy - that citizens would "live from day to day, indulging the pleasure of the moment". This is yet another impulse that Ukip has harnessed. Even as it rages against modernity, it exploits the hyper-modern inability to concentrate, to defer gratification, and to pull together in the name of an outcome worth waiting for. They are toddlers in ties, these self-styled purple pimpernels.\par \par \uc2 The Coalition came into being to enable a strategy - principally a fiscal undertaking - to be undertaken. It is inconceivable that this strategy could have been pursued by a Tory minority government. Cameron can express regret for the errors he and his colleagues have made (the bungled \uc2 NHS\uc2  plan, the "Omnishambles" of 2012, the inter-party bickering) and their misplaced hope that the deficit could be wiped out in a Parliament. But that is no argument for changing the strategy itself. It is an argument for finishing the job.\par \par \uc2 However chastened he is by next week's results, the PM must respond by redoubling his commitment to see the job through. No snap reshuffle, no panicked stunts, no magician's misdirection, no premature dismantling of the Coalition.\par \par \uc2 So: he should stick remorselessly to the position on the EU he described in The Sunday Telegraph last week. George Osborne should persist with the fiscal tightening that is now delivering results. Theresa May should put the \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  Act into practice. Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Gove should pursue their respective revolutions.\par \par \uc2 None of this will make the cacophony of criticism stop. No fiscal or educational or welfare strategy will wipe the smile off Farage's face. But, then again, what could? The next fortnight will belong to the tamarins. But, in the end, it is the patient marmosets who get things done.\par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband is the one who should be sweating-as the man who hopes to be settling into No 10 next year, he has to triumph on Thursday\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140518ea5i0008m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw270\pich32\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4050\pichgoal480

\par\par \uc2 Business\par \b \uc2 'IF CLEGG GETS A MANSION TAX I'LL HAVE TO SELL'\b0\par\par\uc2 Caroline Rees   \par \uc2 1,388 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph\par \uc2 STEL\par \uc2 1; National\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Sunday Telegraph \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 MONEY FAME AND FORTUNE\par \par \uc2 Tom Conti's 'comfortable' life includes a house in Hampstead - which the Lib Dems' 'Stalinist' taxes would force him to sell, he tells Caroline Rees\par \par \uc2 How did your childhood affect your attitude to money?\par \par \uc2 My parents had women's hairdressing shops, so my upbringing with money was very practical. You only spent what you could afford. My father was an Italian \b \uc2 immigrant\b0 \uc2  and it was tough for \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  because there were no benefits. But my parents' businesses did well and they were generous.\par \par \uc2 What was your first job?\par \par \uc2 A college chum and I sold encyclopedias, which was a great learning experience. We were sent into no-hope areas and told to say such things as "Is a washing machine more important than your children's education?" Sometimes the door was slammed in your face, quite rightly, then we finally got a signature from these people who could not afford this pointless encyclopedia. On the bus home we were both thinking that it was just wrong, so we went back and talked them out of it. It took us as long as it did to sell them the bloody thing.\par \par \uc2 So you didn't earn a penny?\par \par \uc2 No. Never employ me as a salesman.\par \par \uc2 What about your first acting pay cheque?\par \par \uc2 My first proper job was in rep in Glasgow in the early Sixties. The pay was \u163\'00\'A38 a week. The leading actors got \u163\'00\'A311 and with that they paid for their digs, food and a drink on a Saturday night. Amazing. The standard of plays wasn't good, really, and one very foggy night the fog came into the theatre. We could barely see the audience. I think there were about eight people out there.\par \par \uc2 Was there an obvious financial turning point in your career?\par \par \uc2 It could have been a play at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh in 1971. We were living in London by this time, so I said: "I can't come to Edinburgh for \u163\'00\'A314 a week." The producer said: "Well, Nigel Hawthorne said the same thing and he hasn't stopped working since."\par \par \uc2 So I did it and that's exactly what happened. From that, I got a play in London with Paul Scofield called Savages. Everybody came to see Paul, and I occasionally got glanced at. That led to a movie with Joseph Losey.\par \par \uc2 Then the big change came with the television series The Glittering Prizes because that introduced me to America. The fact it was shown there made it easier when a producer decided to take the play I was in, Whose Life is it Anyway?, to New York. He proved in court that I had the right to enter America - as "an alien of extraordinary ability".\par \par \uc2 God bless America is all I can say.\par \par \uc2 What's the difference in pay in America?\par \par \uc2 Huge. When the American producer Barney Rosenzweig came here he said: "For God's sake, how do you people manage? Nobody earns any money and everything costs a ----ing fortune." For a television movie in this country at that time you might have been paid five grand. There, you would be paid \u163\'00\'A3250,000. I was astounded.\par \par \uc2 What has been your best-paid job?\par \par \uc2 A movie in 1986 called Miracles, a comedy about a divorced couple. I'm not going into how much I got, but a lot.\par \par \uc2 Did your fee go up after Shirley Valentine?\par \par \uc2 It had already gone up, but it was a little boost. It was obviously a good combination, Pauline [Collins] and me, so I would have thought any producer worth their salt would have said "Let's find something else and put them in it", but nobody came up with that idea. It's nice that it's still watched. And you get residuals on DVD sales. I get quite a lot from the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises.\par \par \uc2 How lucrative were the Vauxhall advertisements you did in the Nineties?\par \par \uc2 It was a huge amount of money. Those were the last days of the golden age of advertising.\par \par \uc2 You're working in the West End now. Is theatre paid well enough?\par \par \uc2 For most actors, absolutely not. Most live in penury all their lives. A few of us have been extraordinarily lucky. If you're a leading actor on a percentage of the box office it can be quite good, but you've got to be good enough to bring people in. You're expected to earn it.\par \par \uc2 Has there been a time when you really worried about money?\par \par \uc2 You worry about money all the time because you fear that every job might be your last. At one point I was playing guitar in restaurants to pay the rent. It was miserable. It's easier to walk on to a stage and start King Lear than it is to walk out into a restaurant and start singing. One evening a man put his hands over his ears and I thought: "I agree with you, chum."\par \par \uc2 Have you ever done anything for the money that you regretted artistically?\par \par \uc2 Not for the money, though I've done things I've regretted. I did a new Arthur Miller play called The Ride Down Mt Morgan. I always arrange an out-loud reading with chums before I do a play, but I didn't with this. I thought, "He's Arthur Miller, for God's sake, and writes fabulous plays."\par \par \uc2 Halfway through the first rehearsal I got a terrible cold feeling down my back and thought, "There's something seriously wrong with this bloody play." But you couldn't go to Arthur and say, "You've really got to look at the second act." It lasted about three weeks.\par \par \uc2 What has been your best investment?\par \par \uc2 Buying my house in Hampstead 29 years ago was the only financially sensible thing I've done because it's the family's security. It has gone up in value about 15 times. If the Stalinist Mr Clegg ever got his desire for a mansion tax, we wouldn't be able to live here.\par \par \uc2 What do you think of the idea of a tax on high earners?\par \par \uc2 Insane and pointless. No one should pay more than 25pc of their income in tax - a flat rate for Amazon and everybody. Money has to circulate and at the moment it doesn't. If you let people have more of their own money, the country will start to work again.\par \par \uc2 What has been your biggest financial mistake?\par \par \uc2 I'm not a financial gambler, so I've never ventured anything and lost it.\par \par \uc2 Do you invest in shares?\par \par \uc2 No. I'm not hungry enough. I did buy a large allocation of Premium Bonds some years ago, and they were quite good. We used to win \u163\'00\'A350 a few times a month, then they halved the prize money.\par \par \uc2 Do you prefer to pay by cash or card?\par \par \uc2 Cash for small things, but mostly a debit card. I use my credit card sometimes because I've got a special NatWest Black one and I don't feel it's fair to take all the benefits - insurance, access to airport lounges - if I don't use it.\par \par \uc2 Are you a spender or a saver?\par \par \uc2 If things were different, I'd be a saver and enjoy the interest. I'm not a spender beyond what I can afford. That's my dad talking.\par \par \uc2 What has been your most extravagant purchase?\par \par \uc2 Apart from the house, a Bentley years ago, which was \u163\'00\'A332,000. I don't know why I spent that. You don't have to. I'm driving one now that is 30 years old. I buy old cars because I can fix them. I don't want to have to plug in a laptop to find out what's wrong with the damn car.\par \par \uc2 Does money make you happy?\par \par \uc2 No, but the absence of it would make me extremely sad. Money buys security and you start to live at a certain level. Life for us has been comfortable for a very long time and I wouldn't like that to change.\par \par \uc2 Tom Conti is appearing in 'Twelve Angry Men' at the Garrick Theatre, London\par \par \uc2 I still earn from Shirley Valentine DVD sales\par \par \uc2 Document STEL000020140518ea5i0004y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw125\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1875\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par \b \uc2 A few more for you to sort out here, Mr Farage?\b0\par\par\uc2 JOSHUA TAYLOR   \par \uc2 676 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 Liverpool Echo\par \uc2 LIVECH\par \uc2 1; National\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) The Liverpool Daily Post & Echo Ltd, 2014.   \par \par \uc2 4 city UKIP election candidates probed over \uc2 Facebook\uc2  posts EXCLUSIVE\par \par \uc2 A WANNABE UK Independence Party (UKIP) councillor called for Russian militia to be shipped into Britain to "clean up our city centres".\par \par \uc2 Austin Lucas, who hopes to become a councillor for Cressington in this Thursday's local elections, also heaped praise on Russian president \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 , saying: "At least he loves his country."\par \par \uc2 Mr Lucas's comments are among a series of bizarre statements made on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  by UKIP council candidates in Liverpool.\par \par \uc2 Enid Lindsay, who is standing in Fazakerley, called voters "idiots", while Clubmoor's Paul Forrest claimed "racism is a natural outcome of evolution" and said the Catholic church is "far more dangerous" than the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile John Halvorsen, a candidate in Everton, lists the Liverpool division of the far-right English Defence League among his "likes" on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . He is also a member of an online group called "Was Enoch Powell Right?".\par \par \uc2 These \uc2 Facebook\uc2  posts were brought to the attention of the Sunday ECHO by ex-UKIP member turned anti-extremism campaigner Colin Cortbus. Mr Lucas wrote on the social networking site in February: "Can we please import some Cossacks to clean up our city centres - say what you will about Vlad Putin, at least he loves his country."\par \par \uc2 In March he re-published a comment by Mr Forrest that warned of pro-abortion "feminist witches who consider children to be nothing more than pets or fashion accessories". Mr Lucas went on to say Green MP Caroline Lucas is "probably a witch". Meanwhile, in December last year just before border controls between Britain, Romania and Bulgaria were relaxed, Ms Lindsay wrote on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 : "What kind of idiots have the British electorate become? "We are faced with a tidal wave of new \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  in less than one week and the public seem to have accepted that there is nothing they can do about it."\par \par \uc2 She added: "The present British population should be ashamed of themselves."\par \par \uc2 Mr Forrest, meanwhile, said on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  in 2012 that "evolution and racism go hand in hand", before posting a link to an article about biology and eugenics. He went on to say "racism is a natural outcome of evolution, not a misunderstanding of it".\par \par \uc2 He added: "Genocidal racists are being true to evolution far more than those people who want Darwinism but without its social consequences."\par \par \uc2 In a separate online debate in 2012, he wrote: "Please stop saying Roman Catholics are part of the Christian church. They've killed more Christians throughout history than all others put together."\par \par \uc2 He later added: "As imposters go, the Church of Rome is far more dangerous than the KKK." During the same discussion he also laid into Islam, saying its claim to be a "religion of peace" was "downright misinfor mation". The four candidates were invited to speak to the Sunday ECHO about their online activities, but all either declined or failed to respond to our requests for a comment. The Sunday ECHO also visited Mr Lucas's home address - as stated on the election nomination form - but we were told he no longer lived there.\par \par \uc2 UKIP boss set to investigate THE chairman of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in Liverpool has vowed to investigate following today's revelations. In a statement, Neil Miney told us: "Whilst some candidates may have expressed unguarded comments, these do not represent party policy or, necessarily, their full opinion in context.\par \par \uc2 We shall investigate all the allegations and, if appropriate, take action."\par \par \uc2 The Sunday ECHO's report today will be the latest in a long line of headaches for UKIP leader Nigel Farage, caused by potentially offensive comments made by party members. Mr Miney added: "UKIP is a non-racist, non-sectarian political party.\par \par \uc2 In Liverpool branch, we welcome people from all backgrounds if they agree with our core values of democracy and free speech. "We believe in freedom, even when this can sometimes be awkward."\par \par \uc2 Document LIVECH0020140518ea5i0003y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw125\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1875\pichgoal600

It's clearly the tip of the iceberg as far as these allegations are concerned and the way \uc2 Serco\uc2  has dealt with them.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He added: \u8220\'20\'1CThis is clearly a case where there are serious questions that remain to be answered.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Former Director of Public Prosecutions Ken MacDonald QC said: \u8220\'20\'1CHere, the suggestion is that in the face of credible allegations that a member of their staff had committed repeated sexual assaults on an especially vulnerable inmate, \uc2 Serco\uc2  conducted an inadequate investigation in secret and then did everything they could to hide their findings from the public.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Harriet Wistrich, the lawyer representing the alleged victim, said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe failure of the investigatory process affects not only the complainant but all women detained at Yarl's Wood, since it allows abuse to continue and thrive.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Norman Abusin, \uc2 Serco\uc2 's director at Yarl's Wood, said: \u8220\'20\'1CSexual contact between residents and staff is always completely unacceptable. We view any complaint of this type of behaviour extremely seriously and have strict procedures for dealing with any such complaints: they are always investigated and the necessary disciplinary action is always taken, including informing the relevant authorities.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur managers and staff work hard to establish and maintain good relationships with the residents. The most recent HM Chief Inspector of Prisons inspection report, issued in October 2013, considered it to be an establishment where residents feel safe and there is little violence.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHowever, we are not complacent and make continuous improvements to the services we provide.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020140518ea5i0008d\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par \b \uc2 Immigrants\uc2  who move to Britain need to learn to speak English and \u8216\'20\'18respect our way of life\u8217\'20\'19, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid claims\b0\par\par\uc2 MAIL ON SUNDAY REPORTER   \par \uc2 361 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par 02:54\par \uc2 Mail Online\par \uc2 DAMONL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Associated Newspapers.

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Comment | Editorial\par \par \uc2 One thing can be said in Nigel Farage's favour: he has brought the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  election campaign to life. Our ComRes opinion poll today suggests that the UK Independence Party is heading for one of the most striking election upsets in recent history. For a so-called protest party that has no MPs in the House of Commons to win 35 per cent of a national vote would be extraordinary.\par \par \uc2 Ukip's advance has, late in the day, provoked a reaction. Our poll (see page 7) puts the Green Party in fourth place: possibly because pro-Europeans have been galvanised. Supporters of the European ideal may see the force of Nick Clegg's argument that a "party of out" needs to be opposed by a "party of in", without wanting to vote for a party that is "in" the coalition government.\par \par \uc2 What is more, many pro-Europeans have been disappointed by Ed Miliband's caution, and by his apology for the principled decision of the Labour government to open our borders to citizens of the new EU nations in 2004.\par \par \uc2 However, it was encouraging that the Labour Party started to take a more robust approach last week. Yvette Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary, sought to engage directly with Ukip's appeal to Labour's working-class supporters. She said: "Ukip wants to end paid holiday rights and reduce job protection - making it easier for employers to abuse \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  as a cheap option." She said Labour would "outlaw agencies hiring only overseas", and insisted: "Pulling out of Europe won't help - that risks jobs."\par \par \uc2 This was probably a more effective way of taking the fight to Ukip than that adopted by the Liberal Democrats, who made a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  video simply assembling some of the racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic things that various Ukip candidates and councillors had said. Persuading floating voters that there is something unsavoury about Ukip turned out to be a task better carried out by the party's leader than by his political opponents.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage's interview with James O'Brien on LBC on Friday was an important moment in this campaign. The Ukip leader was asked why people should feel uncomfortable if a Romanian family moved into their street but not if a German family did. He replied: "You know what the difference is."\par \par \uc2 A line was crossed, as was confirmed by two things yesterday. One was Ukip's defiant statement of clarification, which sought to associate Romanians with "criminality". The other was an editorial in The Sun, which condemned Mr Farage as a racist.\par \par \uc2 The turning of The Sun is significant, not least because it has carried its fair share of alarmist stories about Roma in the past. Let us hope that it marks the turning of a tide. Let us also hope that enough people will have noticed the most visible party in this campaign and made a judgement accordingly.\par \par \uc2 The Independent on Sunday has always accepted that leaving the EU is an arguable policy that should be debated. It is a shame that Ukip has clouded it with prejudice. But the debate must go on.\par \par \uc2 In our view, the EU is a valuable if flawed joint venture. Its parliament is perhaps more flawed than valuable. And the closed-list voting system used in Great Britain, which gives too much power to party machines, is more flawed still. Yet Thursday's election is important. If there are local elections in your area, they are important, too.\par \par \uc2 Turnout is expected to be low: at least we can give Mr Farage some credit for rousing people who disagree with Ukip, with a reminder of why voting matters. The thing about democracy, as Jean-Jacques Rousseau did not quite say, is that it does not come round that often. So when the chance comes, as it does this week, whatever you do, do vote.\par \par \uc2 Document INDOS00020140518ea5i0002y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw337\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5055\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Comment\par \b \uc2 Falling for the PM\b0\par\par\uc2 JANE MERRICK POLITICAL EDITOR   \par \uc2 1,127 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2014\par \uc2 Independent On Sunday\par \uc2 INDOS\par \uc2 1ST\par 25\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 Independent Print Ltd. All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Comment | A hand-holder's guide to voting Nigel Farage reveals his true colours Islam's real representatives The MP, animal rights activists and a furry bedspread\par \par \uc2 Picture the scene: you are on your way to work, walking down a busy London high street. It's hot, and the noise of the traffic seems closer and louder than normal. You feel a bit woozy, reach out for a wall that's not quite in reach. The next thing you know, you're lying on the pavement looking up at the sky, and there's the Prime Minister, holding your hand and telling you reassuringly that the ambulance is on its way.\par \par \uc2 This must have been something like the experience of a pedestrian who collapsed on a street in Harrow last week. As she fell, the car carrying \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  and his rival Boris Johnson glided past. I can only take a wild guess, but I imagine the two men were rowing about the London Mayor's evasiveness over his political ambitions at the time. "Cripes, Dave, we need to rescue that woman!" Boris probably said, grateful of the opportunity for further evasion, and instructed the driver to pull over. An ambulance was called and, while waiting for paramedics, the PM held the stricken woman's hand.\par \par \uc2 When I heard this last detail, my instinctive, gut reaction was that if I had to choose between Cameron and Johnson, I'd rather the PM held my hand (although if I could choose anyone it would be my mum). But is it that I think Cameron would be more serious, while Boris would make light of my predicament? Is the Prime Minister perceived as more reassuring and compassionate than his fellow rumbustious former Bullingdon Clubber? And does this say anything about what voters want at a general election?\par \par \uc2 Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at \uc2 Lancaster University\uc2  and a keen observer of politics, says there is an aspect to Cameron - given how movingly he spoke about caring for his disabled son, Ivan - that will have registered, even only subconsciously, with voters. The personal tragedy he and his wife suffered with the death of Ivan, aged six, stirs memories in the electorate.\par \par \uc2 Does this view of a compassionate Conservative translate into votes? Professor Cooper says it can. Excluding those people who make up the core vote for each party, the parties are, as ever, hunting for the floating voters next May. There will be a rump of undecided voters who will make their choice on the economy - whether they are swept along by the feel-good factor, or they feel the cost of living is still too high.\par \par \uc2 With the 2015 election looking as close as it is, it could come down to an even smaller but all powerful section of voters who will pencil a cross based on their guts - what Prof Cooper calls the "tipping-point factor".\par \par \uc2 Even though in a parliamentary democracy we vote for a local MP, it is the prospective inhabitant of No 10 we have in our minds as we stand in the voting booth. It will be the seemingly insignificant but very human things, like whether we would be reassured by Cameron holding our hand or Ed Miliband rushing to our rescue if we fell off our bike, as he once did with a woman in Camden, that could decide next year's race.\par \par \uc2 Not so nice Nigel\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage would possibly not be the ideal person for hand-holding, but voters often pick him as the party leader they would most like to go to the pub with. This matey, pint-at-lunchtime image has served the Ukip leader well. But has Farage reached his own tipping point?\par \par \uc2 The Sun says his assertion that there's a difference between German and Romanian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  is racist, and I agree. If the newspaper with the toughest line on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  is against Farage, it's difficult to see where he goes from here. Even his clarification yesterday didn't help matters when he claimed "any normal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door" because of the "high level of criminality" among this community.\par \par \uc2 For weeks we have watched a series of Ukip councillors, candidates and activists exposed for having seriously dodgy sexist, racist and homophobic views. Farage has suggested they are on the periphery of his party. But his LBC interview shows it is the leader himself who has dubious opinions.\par \par \uc2 Muslims to put faith in\par \par \uc2 Despite this, the Defence minister Anna Soubry insisted last week that Britain is a moderate and tolerant country. This weekend marks the first anniversary of the horrific murder of soldier Lee Rigby by men claiming their actions were in the name of Islam. Those who truly represent the Muslim faith found their actions abhorrent.\par \par \uc2 It is individuals such as former British Army Captain Afzal Amin, who is standing as a Conservative candidate for Parliament, and Amir Cheema, the Scout leader who has received an award from the Prime Minister for bringing children from different backgrounds together, who really represent Muslims in this country.\par \par \uc2 There's no fur like fake fur\par \par \uc2 In the staid House of Commons, where you need a letter from \uc2 English Heritage\uc2  to put up a pin board on the office wall, there was much taking-in of breath at photographs of Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi's \u163\'00\'A34.5m house which has just come on the market with estate agent Winkworth in Putney, south-west London.\par \par \uc2 Zahawi's flamboyance in interior design would make Liberace give up and go to \uc2 Ikea\uc2 : the purple pool table is the least colourful thing there. On the walls are Warhol-esque paintings of Martin Luther King, Liza Minnelli and the MP for Stratford-upon-Avon himself. In the master suite, hanging over the black leather bed, is a bedspread made of what looks like the fur of 14 raccoon dogs. Peta, the animal-rights group, says it hopes that the cover is a fake. It says that given Zahawi is a co-founder of the polling firm YouGov, he should know that the British public are opposed to fur for "frivolous fashions and disgusting decorations".\par \par \uc2 "If the fur is real, Zahawi should donate it to Peta so it can be used in an educational display about violence in the fur industry or else bury it," says a spokesman. In fact, when I asked the MP for a response, he says his wife, Lana, was responsible for the interior design and that he's "almost certain it's fake".

A free school lunch, that is, for every young child.\par \par \uc2 No matter what it costs the taxpayer, or the economy, or how useful it is. Education Secretary Michael Gove\u8217\'20\'19s outriders have leaked mercilessly on his behalf. The idea is \u8220\'20\'1Cback of a fag packet" stuff \u8212\'20\'14 and Nick Clegg has lied to taxpayers about the cost.\par \par \uc2 Nick then had a sense of humour failure, even allegedly trying to have the probable leaker, former Gove adviser Dominic Cummings, arrested.\par \par \uc2 Why did he react so badly?\par \par \uc2 Clegg is facing the end of Parliament \u8212\'20\'14 and probably the end of his career. The Lib Dems face a horrible 12 months. They deserve it.\par \par \uc2 They are likely to be utterly humiliated in the Euro elections. Ukip are a one-trick pony \u8212\'20\'14 the real story will be the near-wipeout of our supposedly national third party.\par \par \uc2 They then face disaster in the Newark by-election \u8212\'20\'14 along with Nigel Farage. The Tories will win, bursting Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s bubble. But look for the Lib Dems to do so poorly they might lose their deposit.\par \par \uc2 One election disaster might be forgettable \u8212\'20\'14 two, and Clegg will start to look very vulnerable indeed.\par \par \uc2 As the Tories move ahead in national polls, the economy is improving at a rate of knots \u8212\'20\'14 due to policies Vince Cable has shrieked against for years.\par \par \uc2 What do the Lib Dems have to show for their years in office? Every policy they\u8217\'20\'19ve been allowed to enact has been a total disaster.\par \par \uc2 AV referendum \u8212\'20\'14 LOST . Lords reform \u8212\'20\'14 DEFEATED . Tuition fees \u8212\'20\'14 IMPOSED . Leveson Press censorship \u8212\'20\'14 DITCHED .\par \par \uc2 Gove makes no secret of his contempt for Cable and Clegg and he speaks for most Tories, who are sick of the yellows and their soft-Labour attitude.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s Clegg who wants to stop us renegotiating with Brussels. It\u8217\'20\'19s Clegg who protects the Human Rights Act. It\u8217\'20\'19s Clegg who\u8217\'20\'19s been exposed as soft on knife crime \u8212\'20\'14 BANNING harsher sentences for thugs who carry them.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Gove-ites note that all \u8220\'20\'1CI agree with Nick" policies are worthless gimmicks. I couldn\u8217\'20\'19t think of a single one, so I had a \uc2 Google\uc2 . It seems Gove\u8217\'20\'19s bang-on.\par \par \uc2 Try these Clegg clangers: \u163\'00\'A3500million to power electric cars. The nonsense of Green Cities. The Regional Growth Fund that\u8217\'20\'19s paid out only a third of its cash to local projects, \u163\'00\'A34billion that\u8217\'20\'19s so far created just 18,000 jobs.\par \par \uc2 Bloody hell, Nick, just write everybody a cheque for fifty grand a year. It\u8217\'20\'19ll be cheaper!\par \par \uc2 In short, everything major Clegg wanted to do has been a failure. In the 2015 election it will be a two-horse race \u8212\'20\'14 and the Lib Dems will be nowhere in it. Coalition? It\u8217\'20\'19s possible \u8212\'20\'14 but Clegg won\u8217\'20\'19t be involved.\par \par \uc2 Anybody would be better. Danny Alexander now has the most clout, he\u8217\'20\'19s worked like a serious partner to Osborne.\par \par \uc2 So that\u8217\'20\'19s why Clegg threw his lunch tray across Gove\u8217\'20\'19s cafeteria. He\u8217\'20\'19s finished in politics, and he knows it.\par \par \uc2 - FLOODY hell, barmy Labour luvvie Chris Smith is at it again. The disastrous chief of the Environment Agency says houses should be built so they can \u8220\'20\'1Cfloat away", which will save him having to dredge rivers. Can we put him out to sea instead?\par \par \uc2 Daft Ed's forging ahead YOU have to hand it to Ed Miliband.\par \par \uc2 Despite plunging polls and all the evidence he\u8217\'20\'19s wrong, he just ploughs right ahead.\par \par \uc2 Miliband is a conviction politician.

\par\par \b \uc2 These weird Euro elections are the sunset of democracy\b0\par\par\uc2 By Christopher Booker   \par \uc2 1,448 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 May 2014\par 23:23\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online\par \uc2 TELUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 The Telegraph Online \u169\'00\'A9 2014. Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 There is no way Ukip or anyone else can take back control of our borders so long as we wish to continue trading with the EU\u8217\'20\'19s single market\par \par \uc2 Everything is weird about this week\u8217\'20\'19s Euro-election, and nothing weirder than the possibility that the party that comes top of the poll will be one that hasn\u8217\'20\'19t got a single seat in Parliament. Our other parliament, in Brussels and Strasbourg, plays an important part in producing a huge proportion of the laws we must all obey. Yet on Thursday we shall only be choosing a bunch of unknown nonentities to represent us there, commanding just 9 per cent of the votes that can pass or reject those laws \u8211\'20\'13 and, hardly surprisingly, the majority of the British electorate will not even bother to turn out to vote for something they don\u8217\'20\'19t begin to understand.\par \par \uc2 We look askance at what the major parties tell us this election is all about. Mr Miliband tells us we should vote for him because he will freeze energy prices, which he has done more than anyone to put up; Mr Clegg tells us we should vote for him, because the Lib Dems are the only party that will keep us in the EU; Mr Cameron tells us that his is the only party that will give us the chance to vote in a referendum to leave it, although he says there is no way he could ever support a vote for us getting out.\par \par \uc2 The central figure of this campaign has been Nigel Farage, which is why the press and the media have devoted so much coverage to vilifying him. I go back a long way with Mr Farage. We have often spoken on platforms together since 1994, when he was already the star performer for a Ukip that had barely got off the ground. Just before the 1997 election, he invited me to give the keynote speech at Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s first national conference. In 1999, I accompanied him to Strasbourg, shortly after his election as one of the party\u8217\'20\'19s first three MEPs, to report on just what a strange, unreal madhouse the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  was, housed in a building that was like a cross between a Kafka novel and a Fritz Lang film.\par \par \uc2 But if one issue has dominated this present, equally unreal campaign, it has been that symbolised in Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s election leaflet, showing a beaming Mr Farage under the headline: \u8220\'20\'1COur politicians have allowed open-door \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 Only Ukip Will Take Back Control.\u8221\'20\'1D This is as empty a pledge as Mr Cameron\u8217\'20\'19s about that 2017 referendum, which can never happen. There is no way Ukip or anyone else can take back control of our borders so long as we wish to continue trading with the EU\u8217\'20\'19s single market, with which our \u8220\'20\'1Copen-door\u8221\'20\'1D policy is as inextricably linked as it is with our belonging to the \uc2 Council of Europe\uc2 , the UN and much else. The only way Britain could regain control over \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  would be to break every kind of international agreement, and to slam the door on the world.\par \par \uc2 It is equally disturbing that a party founded on a desire to extricate us from the EU should have no properly worked-out policy for how this could be done. Ask Ukip what are the practical steps whereby we could achieve a successful exit from the EU, and the answer is little more than a blank stare and empty platitudes.\par \par \uc2 The underlying reason, of course, why Ukip is likely to do well this week is that it is the only way in which we can express our anger and contempt for the entire political class, which we feel has betrayed us, lost in its bubble of trivial and meaningless make-believe. It is for that reason alone that, joining so many others across Europe flocking to support EU-sceptic parties, I will vote for them. But I shall do so well aware that this is only a gesture \u8211\'20\'13 all that is left to us as we see what remains of our democracy gurgling further down the plughole, and in the sad but sure knowledge that where there is no vision, the people must eventually perish.\par \par \uc2 You must not challenge our consensus, say the warmists\par \par \uc2 The climate sceptics have certainly got pretty excited over Dr Lennart Bengtsson \u8211\'20\'13 scarcely a household name but someone they can describe as \u8220\'20\'1Ca leading climate scientist\u8221\'20\'1D. He is the former head of two prestigious European meteorological institutes, and a keen \u8220\'20\'1Cclimate modeller\u8221\'20\'1D, who recently defected from the international global-warming establishment to join the advisers of Lord Lawson\u8217\'20\'19s Global Warming Policy Foundation. Then last week he had to resign because of \u8220\'20\'1CMcCarthy\u8221\'20\'1D-style pressure from his old warmist colleagues, so intense that he feared for his health. And now he has made front-page news by revealing that a paper he co\u8211\'20\'13authored, claiming that official global warming claims have been exaggerated, was rejected by a leading climate science journal because it would have given ammunition to the \u8220\'20\'1Cclimate deniers\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 All this has produced a storm of counter-protest from the sceptics, claiming that it shows how absurdly intolerant the warmists have become in their desperation to protect their beloved \u8220\'20\'1Cconsensus\u8221\'20\'1D. It is true that Lennart was once a cheerleader for their orthodoxy. And it is true that he has recently shown scientific honesty in his growing disenchantment with climate models programmed to assume that rising CO2 levels must inevitably lead to disastrous warming.\par \par \uc2 But the fact is that it has long been obvious to any dispassionate observer that, as global temperatures have so dismally failed to rise as they predicted, those computer models on which the whole theory rested were hopelessly flawed. Equally, it has long been clear, as we saw with \u8220\'20\'1CClimategate\u8221\'20\'1D, that the orthodox establishment will stop at nothing to protect its deluded belief system from criticism.\par \par \uc2 There must always be joy over any sinner who repenteth. But the real honour should go to those proper scientists such as Dr Richard Lindzen, who for years courted derision by pointing out that the emperor had no clothes, because they never lost their grasp on what genuine science is all about. As I once tried to reassure another of them, Dr Fred Singer, when he was in an unusually gloomy mood, \u8220\'20\'1Cwe have two invincible allies in this fight \u8211\'20\'13 one is nature, the other is truth\u8221\'20\'1D. In fact, the ridiculous hounding of Dr Lennart is only another tiny symptom of how those two allies are slowly winning the day.\par \par \uc2 'Immoral\u8217\'20\'19 tax avoiders are only obeying EU law\par \par \uc2 'It\u8217\'20\'19s not on,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mrs Margaret Hodge, stamping her little foot. What aroused her ire as chairman of the public accounts committee was the news that Amazon last year paid the Treasury a pitiful \u163\'00\'A39.7\u8201\'20\'09million in corporation tax on its UK earnings of \u163\'00\'A34.7billion. But last November she was branding such tax avoidance as \u8220\'20\'1Cimmoral\u8221\'20\'1D, referring not just to Amazon but also to \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 , \uc2 Google\uc2 , Apple, Next, \uc2 Vodafone\uc2 , Pizza Express, the foreign-owned companies that sell us water and electricity, and all the countless other firms that manage to pay only minimal amounts of tax on the hundreds of billions of pounds they make from their UK customers.\par \par \uc2 What Mrs Hodge and all the other politicians and commentators who ritually wax righteous about this wholesale tax avoidance never seem to mention is Chapter 4 of the Treaty on \uc2 European Union\uc2 . Articles 63 to 66 of this treaty spell out very clearly that\u160\'00\'A0 \u8220\'20\'1Call restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited\u8221\'20\'1D; and it is this that makes it perfectly legal for companies to move their earnings to whichever country their tax liability will be lowest, whether elsewhere in the EU, Jersey, the Cayman Islands or wherever.\par \par \uc2 No one knows this better than \uc2 Her Majesty\u8217\'20\'19s Revenue & Customs\uc2 , which, in 2007, lost a historic test case on the matter in the \uc2 European Court of Justice\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So why are Mrs Hodge and co so unwilling ever to admit that, under EU law, there is nothing we can do about a racket which, according to one estimate, could be costing Britain as much as \u163\'00\'A3120billion a year in lost tax revenue?\par \par \uc2 As I have written before, it is because this has become the biggest EU \u8220\'20\'1Celephant in the room\u8221\'20\'1D: so enormous and so embarrassing that it is better\u160\'00\'A0just to stamp your foot and regularly give off little squeaks\u160\'00\'A0of protest about how \u8220\'20\'1Cit\u160\'00\'A0isn\u8217\'20\'19t on\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140517ea5h004ef\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Probe into language school where 'migrants can buy crucial English certificates for \u163\'00\'A3500'\b0\par\par\uc2 By Dion Dassanayake   \par \uc2 377 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 May 2014\par 19:57\par \uc2 express.co.uk\par \uc2 EXCO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014   \par \par \b \uc2 IMMIGRANTS\b0 \uc2  who speak no English are able to buy a crucial certificate which shows they have passed a "secure" language test, it has been reported today.\par \par \uc2 A language school has been accused of selling crucial qualifications for \u163\'00\'A3500[PA]\par \par \uc2 The documents, which are required by anyone who wants to permanently stay in the UK and apply for British citizenship, are allegedly being sold for \u163\'00\'A3500.\par \par \uc2 The accusations surround one language school in London and Home Office staff have today searched the premises.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  and enforcement teams have attended the Learn Pass Succeed school in Upton Park following an undercover newspaper sting.\par \par \uc2 The Daily Mail filmed the documents allegedly being sold at the examination centre for \u163\'00\'A3500.\par \par \uc2 The accusations have been levelled at the LPS school in the capital [PA]\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  and Security Minister James Brokenshire told the paper: "The Home Office takes any allegation of fraud extremely seriously and we have already begun a full investigation.\par \par \uc2 "We will take the strongest possible action against anyone who is found to have abused the rules - including the possibility of criminal prosecutions for fraud."\par \par \uc2 Examinations watchdog \uc2 Ofqual\uc2  are aware of the allegations and said they were seeking further information "as a matter of urgency".\par \par \uc2 The investigation into the school was carried out after the newspaper received a tip-off from a whistleblower.\par \par \uc2 Uzwan Ghani, one of the directors of LPS, said the problem was confined to its Upton Park branch.\par \par \b \uc2 Immigration\b0 \uc2  and enforcement teams have attended the school today [GETTY]\par \par \uc2 The school have four branches in London and said tests at Upton Park have been suspended.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to the paper, Mr Ghani said: "I'm shocked that this has happened and am very concerned as to how it could have happened.\par \par \uc2 "We are very thorough when it comes to checking IDs of candidates before they take the test, so I will have to investigate which of the centres the test was taken in and who the assessor was.\par \par \uc2 "I've been in the business for five years and I've never come across something like this and I would not allow it.

Telegraph Media Group Ltd.   \par \par \uc2 Another day, another \u8220\'20\'1CUkip car crash moment\u8221\'20\'1D. They\u8217\'20\'19ve crashed that old banger so many times it\u8217\'20\'19s amazing that they\u8217\'20\'19re still on the road. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danhodges/100271810/nigel-farage-has-just-had-his-nick-griffin-moment/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 The latest accident was Nigel Farage’s appearance on James O’Brien’s show on LBC}}}\uc2 . Lefty O\u8217\'20\'19Brien\u8217\'20\'19s a brilliant journalist and a nice guy, but he makes Owen Jones look like a Monday Club member \u8211\'20\'13 so it\u8217\'20\'19s no surprise that he hammered Farage hard on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  and expenses. For once, the Ukip leader handled it badly. Partly because of some of the things he\u8217\'20\'19s said about Romanians are simply indefensible and partly because O\u8217\'20\'19Brien\u8217\'20\'19s rage was so pure that he struggled to defuse the situation with his usual bonhomie.\par \par \uc2 Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s foes will say that Farage is finished on the grounds that anyone who sees the interview couldn\u8217\'20\'19t possibly vote for him and his party. But there's two problems with that:\par \par \uc2 * Ninety-nine-point-nine per cent of Britons won't watch the video because they\u8217\'20\'19ve got better things to do with their lives.\par \par \uc2 * Anyone who is already emotionally committed to voting Ukip probably wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t change their mind if Nigel Farage got drunk, tattooed the Union Jack on his forehead and ran across the white cliffs of Dover shouting his own name.\par \par \uc2 The Euros aren\u8217\'20\'19t a general election, so people will take greater risks with their vote than they normally would. And Ukip isn\u8217\'20\'19t a mainstream party, so people don\u8217\'20\'19t judge it by the same high standards. By this point in British history, the voters have all grasped that Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s a little bit right-wing and they aren\u8217\'20\'19t particularly surprised to discover that it attracts fruitcakes. But a significant number of them don\u8217\'20\'19t care because they are bitterly frustrated with the state of the country and see voting Ukip as the loudest (even rudest) way of registering their anger.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/buchanans-revolution/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Here’s a historical parallel from a book what I wrote about American political history}}}\uc2 . In 1996, TV pundit Pat Buchanan entered the New Hampshire presidential primary as an incredibly conservative Republican. After winning two caucuses and placing second in Iowa, he shocked everyone by nudging into first place in the New Hampshire polls on an anti-war, anti-\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , pro-life, economically populist ticket. The Republican Party and the media rallied against him, dredging up every awful thing he\u8217\'20\'19d ever written about women, gays and lesbians, the South Koreans etc. And a couple of days before the vote, they thought they\u8217\'20\'19d hit pay dirt when they discovered that one of Buchanan\u8217\'20\'19s campaign chairs had shared a platform with a white supremacist. Despite all of this, the right-winger still won. Why? Because Buchanan had a solid base of supporters who rallied to their man under attack, who hated the establishment so much that they didn\u8217\'20\'19t care what he said or did, and who were financially so bad off that they voted enthusiastically and in large numbers. The attempt to destroy Buchanan's reputation actually validated his claim to be the outsider candidate and confirmed that voting for him was the best way to register discontent. Crucially, his candidacy died out soon after in the primary process because the wider Republican Party never actually wanted him to be nominee. They were just flirting with radicalism.\par \par \uc2 There are similar dynamics at play in Britain, 2014. The attacks on Farage also confirm that he\u8217\'20\'19s a revolutionary, despised by the mainstream \u8211\'20\'13 and the establishment is expressing the same sense of outrage that the attacks aren\u8217\'20\'19t dragging him down. He, too, is running in a contest that the voters don\u8217\'20\'19t regard as definitive and in which they feel comfortable about \u8220\'20\'1Cthrowing their vote away\u8221\'20\'1D on making a grand statement about the direction of their country. One interesting difference is that Buchanan\u8217\'20\'19s team were fiercely loyal and always stood by each other: Ukip is considerably more fractious. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://victoriamonro.co.uk/why-ive-changed-my-mind-on-ukip/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Yet another libertarian has publicly dropped their support on the grounds that the party is talking too much about \b immigration\b0 }}}\uc2 . An odd complaint to make given that Ukip always has been in favour of tighter controls and that the EU/\b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  questions are inseparable. It\u8217\'20\'19s because of our membership of the EU that the issue is an issue at all.\par \par \uc2 The key point is that Ukip doesn\u8217\'20\'19t play by the usual electoral rules, so don\u8217\'20\'19t be surprised if all these car crashes fail to dent it. Britain is going through a period of political realignment of which the Ukip revolt is probably a symptom rather than the cause. It is an almost revolutionary moment, and the whole point of revolutions is that political orthodoxy is suspended for the duration.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140517ea5h004ed\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

But the Labour leader also said he would not give "false promises" such as setting a target to cut net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He admitted his party had too often turned its back on concerns about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . The remarks signal a Labour decision to readdress \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  in the final days of campaigning before Thursday's local and European elections.\par \par \uc2 He said: "We will never again turn our backs on people who are worried about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . But neither will we turn our back on the rest of the world."\par \par \uc2 Miliband said the election was the most unpredictable in a generation, and he had long known \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  was "a big issue on the doorstep".\par \par \uc2 His party had been on a journey on the issue, he told Airbus workers in North Wales. "I don't believe it is prejudiced to worry about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . We said people needed to change their attitudes. But in fact, we needed to change ours."\par \par \uc2 Britons, he said, "worry about the entitlements people have when they come here and the pressure it might put on the system". However, in a BBC World at One interview, he said he opposed the government's target of getting net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  down to 100,000, and rejected blocking free movement of workers in the EU.\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140517ea5h00036\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ukip's communications director, Patrick O'Flynn, tried to cut short a live radio interview with Nigel Farage yesterday in which the Ukip leader claimed that people knew why Romanians would not make good neighbours.\par \par \uc2 During the interview Farage had difficulty explaining what made him uncomfortable about hearing foreign languages on British trains, when his wife's first language was German. He said he "did not suppose his wife spoke German on trains" and added that he did not object to his own children speaking German "because they can speak English".\par \par \uc2 When it was suggested by the LBC interviewer, James O'Brien, that some of the people Farage had heard might also be bilingual, he said he "had got the distinct feeling English was not their language of choice".\par \par \uc2 He was then forced to qualify his claims that there were primary schools in the East End of London at which most people did not speak English. He conceded such surveys showed English was not the children's first language, explaining: "They come from homes where English is most definitely not the first language, and in too many cases is not their language at all."\par \par \uc2 Farage was pressed on his suggestion that he would feel concerned if Romanians moved in next door. "If you lived in London I think you would be," he said.\par \par \uc2 O'Brien asked: "What about if a group of German children did?

He said Metropolitan police figures showed Romanians were responsible for eye-wateringly high crime figures in London.\par \par \uc2 Farage said the purpose of his remarks about England becoming a foreign land had been to show how people felt uncomfortable about the pace of change.\par \par \uc2 David Cameron, commenting on the LBC interview, said Farage had said some pretty unpleasant things and many people felt that voting for Ukip "would send out a pretty terrible message about Britain". Ukip was offering the politics of anger and not answer, the prime minister said.\par \par \uc2 O'Flynn tried to bring the interview to a close when O'Brien accused Farage of "a reverse ferret" over an offer to have his European parliamentary allowances independently audited, an offer he had made on the BBC Today programme.\par \par \uc2 When it was pointed out that other MEPs - including those from the Labour party - had had their expenses independently audited, O'Flynn intervened, surprising even Farage, who waved him away.\par \par \uc2 O'Flynn said he intervened because the interview had overrun the agreed time and Farage had other appointments.\par \par \uc2 Captions:\par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage, left, on LBC Radio.

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 I buy the Saturday Guardian and take all week to read it. Sport usually goes straight in the recycling, but as a writer with an interest in human rights, \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , community living and children's literature, my favourite stories could be hidden in any of the other sections. An article in the old Money section changed my life. It was about co-housing and featured a development in Stroud. My family and I visited and were so impressed that we are planning to build our own co-housing development in inner-city Leeds.\par \par \uc2 I've worked with asylum seekers and refugees for over seven years, and give lectures on the misrepresentation of \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  in the press. That's why I appreciate how the Guardian challenges the powerful and sticks up for those who can so easily become scapegoats for failures in government policy around housing, employment, education or health. For example, earlier this year the National Audit Office published a report which the Guardian headlined: G4S and \uc2 Serco\uc2  failing to house asylum seekers properly. It wasn't long before some papers found a different angle and instead of highlighting the government and corporate waste and incompetence chose to vilify asylum seekers and foster further hostility and misunderstanding.\par \par \uc2 If you would like to be interviewed in this space, send a brief note to\par \par \uc2 good.to.meet.you@theguardian.com\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140517ea5h0002a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw227\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3405\pichgoal600

The Guardian.  All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Snapshot My 1950s rockabilly dad\par \par \uc2 It's 1958, I'm six years old and posing in our backyard with my rockabilly dad while my mother operates the Brownie camera that commits this image to our family history. Dad has just come home from work in this photo. This is his usual look: very stylish, a typically 50s hairdo with a pompadour at the front and a DA down the back. Perhaps uncommonly, for the 50s, he took care of his physique by weight training, boxing, cycling and swimming.\par \par \uc2 Dad is a working-class chap, becomes a big union supporter and shop steward in his local chapter. But he's not a teddy boy and he doesn't hang out with a gang attacking \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 . He's on shift work at United Dairies so he works nights some weeks and I don't see him very often. He even works on Christmas Day, so I open my presents at about 4am so that he can see me before he leaves.\par \par \uc2 We live in a basement flat in north Paddington, London where, despite the damp, we are fortunate to have a decent landlady and a fair rent as we are sitting tenants. Nearby, the infamous landlord Peter Rachman, owns much of the housing and is notorious for his abuse of tenants, many of whom are newly arrived from the Caribbean. The whole area is troubled with undercurrents of racial unrest. There is hostility among the white working classes towards the new West Indian community culminating in race riots just down the road from us in Notting Hill.\par \par \uc2 I'm blissfully unaware of this racial tension as my friends in the street are a mix of Irish, Nigerian and West Indian as well as white British. We all rub along just fine - I eat their food in their houses and receive invitations to their birthday parties - and vice versa. Round the corner live a beatnik couple. They worry my parents as they are long-haired (therefore dirty) and always wear black. I have no idea what a beatnik is, but they look arty, intelligent and interesting.\par \par \uc2 There is a vast amount of music around me. Our West Indian neighbours throw open the windows on a Friday evening and the partying begins to the rhythm of the Blue Beat. I can see the dancers inside upstairs and others spill out on to the front steps. Upstairs in our house there is an Irish family in residence, a band of four brothers and their singing sister, Biddy - they treat us to traditional Irish songs into the early hours or until my dad asks them to wind it up if it's a school night.\par \par \uc2 Where music is concerned, my rockabilly dad is no exception. He plays a mean harmonica and jew's harp and plays on an improvised drum kit. We love the rock'n'roll and skiffle of the 50s so I grow up on a diet of Elvis, Little Richard and Buddy Holly followed by Cliff, Tommy Steele and others. It's great fun having young parents who dance and sing. We like the harmonies of the Everly Brothers and the Dallas Boys. Sometimes, in our backyard, we have our own skiffle band and we sing and play Lonnie Donegan-style numbers, like Tom Dooley and Cumberland Gap. We play a washboard with a thimble and a double bass made from a tea chest, broom handle and a piece of string.\par \par \uc2 If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say that the strongest influence from my 50s childhood led me to become a beatnik - or a hippy, as it turned out. Sorry, Dad . . .\par \par \uc2 Christine Seal\par \par \uc2 Playlist A dreadlock holiday in France\par \par \uc2 Something More by Groundation\par \par \uc2 "Behold the night sky brings us a new star today / Catch it before it passes away / For all those thought wise become fools today / Rally round the table so I man can pray"\par \par \uc2 Truth be told, I fancied Guillaume's best friend Maxim first when I met them both at an Irish-French summer camp in Northern Ireland as teenagers; but it was with Guillaume that I stayed up late chatting over MSN in the weeks after summer camp had finished.\par \par \uc2 Guillaume was a 17-year-old French boy whose blond dreadlocks reflected his enthusiasm for reggae. Always keen to share his passion for music with others, he even left me his entire CD collection when he came to visit me in Ireland the following school holidays.\par \par \uc2 He was probably relieved he did not have to wait long to see his CDs again as I soon returned them on a visit in France. By this stage I had become a reggae convert and even asked Guillaume to make a few dreadlocks in my hair. Our mutual love of reggae grew into a love for each other and despite being only 15 and 17 we started a long-distance relationship between the south of France and Northern Ireland.\par \par \uc2 More than seven years later and thanks to understanding parents, budget airlines and an array of communication technology, a considerably less dreadlocked Guillaume and I are still doing a long-distance relationship.\par \par \uc2 Over our years together, countless songs earmark meaningful moments and memories. However, the first time I visited Guillaume in France we went to a concert of American roots-reggae band Groundation and their song Something More marks the beginning of all the wonderful years together that have since unfolded.\par \par \uc2 The intended meaning of the lyrics has always been somewhat lost on me, wrapped as it is in symbolic reggae references. Still, as the band repeated the song's "something more" refrain Guillaume gave me a tight squeeze and we shared a smile, which served as a wordless understanding of how we felt about each other.\par \par \uc2 Despite the difficulties presented by a long-distance relationship, there was a real sense of something special, something more between us that would make the challenge upon which we were about to embark completely worthwhile.\par \par \uc2 In a few months. I will be moving to live with Guillaume in France.\par \par \uc2 Lydia Dalitso\par \par \uc2 We love to eat\par \par \uc2 Snappy sausages\par \par \uc2 Ingredients for four\par \par \uc2 Onion, chopped\par \par \uc2 Sausages, sliced into bite-sized pieces (we use a pack of vegetarian sausages pre-cooked in the oven and then cut up)\par \par \uc2 Potatoes, chopped into 2cm cubes (waxy ones, pre-boiled but not too soft)\par \par \uc2 Frozen mixed vegetables, cooked for a few minutes in boiling water\par \par \uc2 Large tin of pineapple chunks in juice\par \par \uc2 Black pepper\par \par \uc2 Precook the sausages, potatoes and mixed vegetables as above. Cook the onion in a large frying pan or wok. Add the potatoes and then the sausages and the mixed vegetables, and finally the pineapple and its juice, and cook through for a few minutes until all is warm. Top with black pepper.\par \par \uc2 This is a recipe my sister and I learned from a cookery demonstration in our local library in Harrogate when we were junior-school aged in the early 1970s.\par \par \uc2 I remember painstakingly writing it down afterwards in my vinyl-covered wipe-clean cookery book (sadly long gone) and it became one of the most exciting teas in my mum's repertoire, and a favourite for me, my brother and sister.\par \par \uc2 My sister has been making it for her children for years, and more recently I have made it for my own teenagers. It still passes as an exciting tea 40 years later (I think the pineapple has something to do with it) and leads to clean plates all round.\par \par \uc2 Sarah Holmes\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020140517ea5h0000l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

I\u8217\'20\'19m 36 and divorced since my husband left me for another woman two years ago.\par \par \uc2 Another single mum moved in next door late last year. She\u8217\'20\'19s fun and outgoing and we quickly became friends.\par \par \uc2 She had a house-warming party and invited me. My son went to stay with my parents so I felt free to enjoy myself.\par \par \uc2 Her 19-year-old brother was there. I\u8217\'20\'19d seen him before but never met him properly.\par \par \uc2 I thought he was cute but only in a baby-brother kind of way until that night.\par \par \uc2 The party was great and the drinks flowed. I got talking to him and told him my troubles.\par \par \uc2 I mentioned how unattractive I had been feeling as I\u8217\'20\'19ve no confidence since my husband went, and he started complimenting me.\par \par \uc2 He told me I was beautiful and any man should be proud to be with me.\par \par \uc2 After a few more drinks he told me he was still a virgin and I told him it would happen when the time was right.\par \par \uc2 We were chatting for a while afterwards but he didn\u8217\'20\'19t make any move on me. We didn\u8217\'20\'19t even hold hands.\par \par \uc2 Later in the evening I went upstairs to the loo and saw he was in his bedroom. I drunkenly offered to be his first.\par \par \uc2 The party was still in full swing and there was a lot of noise from downstairs. Nobody seemed to notice that neither of us were there.\par \par \uc2 I was turned on at the thought that he was a virgin. The sex was very quick but it felt good to be with a man again.\par \par \uc2 My life usually consists of working full-time and looking after my ten-year-old son. I have no social life at all.\par \par \uc2 The next day I regretted what I\u8217\'20\'19d done but he kept texting me, saying how beautiful I am.\par \par \uc2 That is all it takes and I give in. We now meet up for sex whenever I have the opportunity.\par \par \uc2 I know there\u8217\'20\'19s no future in it but he\u8217\'20\'19s becoming infatuated with me.\par \par \uc2 I shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t keep leading him on like this and the longer I wait to end it, the worse it will hurt him, but I just can\u8217\'20\'19t help myself.\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: He isn\u8217\'20\'19t the only one who will be hurt. Your head says there\u8217\'20\'19s no future in it but your heart wants to carry on seeing him.\par \par \uc2 Sooner or later he\u8217\'20\'19s going to meet a girl his own age and want to be with her.\par \par \uc2 Then you will be hurt again and your confidence will take another knock.\par \par \uc2 It would be much better for you to look around and find someone who is at the same stage in life and who will give you a stable, loving relationship.\par \par \uc2 Then you will feel able to tell everyone and your confidence will soar again.\par \par \uc2 Tell this young man that you both need to be free to find someone who is ready for the kind of relationship you each need, in your different ways.\par \par \uc2 Be kind about it. Tell him he will be a great catch for the right girl but you are not the one for him. Stop seeing him and delete his number from your phone.\par \par \uc2 Then get out and find a man who is going to be the one for you. My e-leaflet about social life for single parents will help get you started.\par \par \uc2 Sun, sea and no texts Dear Deidre\par \par \uc2 MY boyfriend\u8217\'20\'19s going on holiday with five single male friends. It\u8217\'20\'19s driving me insane.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m 26, he\u8217\'20\'19s 25. At first it was us with two other couples but they have since separated and the girls\u8217\'20\'19 places were taken by more male mates.\par \par \uc2 I didn\u8217\'20\'19t want to be the only girl so I dropped out. I thought my boyfriend would too but he insists on going.\par \par \uc2 I trust him totally but I\u8217\'20\'19m worried the others will lead him astray.\par \par \uc2 And he never texts me when he\u8217\'20\'19s out with his mates so I know I won\u8217\'20\'19t hear from him. How am I going to cope?\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: Don\u8217\'20\'19t try to boss him around but explain to him that you are really worried he\u8217\'20\'19ll get caught up in what the others do.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s not hard to stay in touch these days. A quick chat/text/message before he goes to bed could help reassure you \u8211\'20\'13 but be realistic. Don\u8217\'20\'19t expect texts every hour on the hour.\par \par \uc2 If you have a generally strong relationship it should survive his break. If not, the writing is on the wall anyway.\par \par \uc2 She keeps mum on dad Dear Deidre\par \par \uc2 MY mum is very evasive about who my real dad is.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m a guy of 24 but last time I asked she said she\u8217\'20\'19d tell me when I\u8217\'20\'19m older.\par \par \uc2 Every time I\u8217\'20\'19ve asked before, she has said that she doesn\u8217\'20\'19t remember or hasn\u8217\'20\'19t got time to explain at that moment.\par \par \uc2 I have asked other family members but they all say that I must speak to my mum.\par \par \uc2 I don\u8217\'20\'19t know why everyone has always avoided talking about it.\par \par \uc2 I have a loving stepdad, who has been my real father since before I can remember.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m not trying to replace him but I\u8217\'20\'19m desperate to know who my biological father is.\par \par \uc2 It is the missing part of my personal jigsaw. It is at the back of my mind every day.\par \par \uc2 I don\u8217\'20\'19t want anything from him. I\u8217\'20\'19m not after money or hoping for a wonderful reunion.\par \par \uc2 I just want peace of mind. I\u8217\'20\'19m worried that my mum has some dark underlying reason for not telling me and that makes it worse.\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: Of course you are old enough to know about your biological father and it\u8217\'20\'19s natural you would want to, but we don\u8217\'20\'19t know what difficult memory this is linked with for your mum.\par \par \uc2 Ask to talk to her on her own, preferably somewhere neutral out of the house, and tell her how much this matters to you, not because you want a different father but to complete your picture of yourself.\par \par \uc2 Promise you won\u8217\'20\'19t criticise her over it.\par \par \uc2 My e-leaflet on Tracing Birth Parents will help you get started and you can find understanding support through After Adoption ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.afteradoption.org.uk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 afteradoption.org.uk}}}\uc2 , 0800 0568 578).\par \par \uc2 Fiance has left our wedding bill to me Dear Deidre\par \par \uc2 I AM getting married in four months and my fianc\u233\'00\'E9 has left it to me to pay for everything.\par \par \uc2 I even paid for my own engagement and wedding rings.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m 29, he is 34. We\u8217\'20\'19ve been together for five years.\par \par \uc2 He was unemployed for two months and I paid for everything, even birthday presents for his children from his previous relationship.\par \par \uc2 He\u8217\'20\'19s now working again but I\u8217\'20\'19m still paying for the wedding.\par \par \uc2 My credit card is maxed out and there are still things to pay for.\par \par \uc2 My fianc\u233\'00\'E9 said he\u8217\'20\'19d pay me back but hasn\u8217\'20\'19t. His only contribution is \u163\'00\'A315 towards the flowers.\par \par \uc2 He\u8217\'20\'19s started contributing towards our living costs but only when I ask.\par \par \uc2 He doesn\u8217\'20\'19t have lots of spare cash, as he pays for his children.\par \par \uc2 But even when he has money, he doesn\u8217\'20\'19t like sharing it.\par \par \uc2 I taxi him about as he won\u8217\'20\'19t learn to drive. I don\u8217\'20\'19t want to end up with a man who relies on me for everything.\par \par \uc2 Am I making a mistake to wed him?\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: He won\u8217\'20\'19t change unless you insist on a total rethink.\par \par \uc2 You will become bitter and resentful if he doesn\u8217\'20\'19t make major changes.\par \par \uc2 My e-leaflet Family Finances will help him understand how costs can be shared.\par \par \uc2 It would be better at least to postpone the wedding and sort things out than to go ahead, become even unhappier and then have to worry about divorce.\par \par \uc2 Father too proud Dear Deidre\par \par \uc2 MY dad\u8217\'20\'19s business is heading for ruin but he\u8217\'20\'19s too proud to admit it.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m a man of 22 and my brother is 21.

It\u8217\'20\'19s really tough for him.\par \par \uc2 Start your next discussion by saying you understand that, but believe the time to tackle the money worries has arrived.\par \par \uc2 Stay calm but don\u8217\'20\'19t budge from that message.\par \par \uc2 You can all get advice from Business Debtline ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.bdl.org.uk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 bdl.org.uk}}}\uc2 , 0800 197 6026), and I\u8217\'20\'19m sending my e-leaflet How To Be Assertive.\par \par \uc2 Ex waits for me in Egypt Dear Deidre\par \par \uc2 I WISH I could love my wife the way she loves me, but I can\u8217\'20\'19t.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m 32 and my wife is 46. I am from Egypt and met her when she was in my country on holiday. I used to work in the tourist business.\par \par \uc2 She is kind and caring and came to Egypt to stay with me several times.\par \par \uc2 Then there was all the trouble in my country, so she paid for me to visit her here in the UK.\par \par \uc2 There was nothing for me back home so we agreed I\u8217\'20\'19d stay and we\u8217\'20\'19d get married.\par \par \uc2 I didn\u8217\'20\'19t love her but I thought love would grow.\par \par \uc2 The trouble is, I still love a woman I used to work with in Egypt. We Skype and she says she loves me and is waiting for me to go back to her.\par \par \uc2 My wife is a good woman but I avoid sex because it\u8217\'20\'19s boring.

Your wife doesn\u8217\'20\'19t deserve that.\par \par \uc2 Tell her you\u8217\'20\'19ve realised this isn\u8217\'20\'19t the right relationship.\par \par \uc2 You can get advice on whether and how you can stay on to work in the UK from the Joint Council For The Welfare of \b \uc2 Immigrants\b0 \uc2  ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.jcwi.org.uk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 jcwi.org.uk}}}\uc2 , 020 7251 8708).\par \par \uc2 Sort out this situation before giving any hope to your other love, or you could end up causing two broken hearts.\par \par \uc2 Son is a dropout on dope Dear Deidre\par \par \uc2 OUR son used to be focused and had ambition but now all he does is smoke weed at his mate\u8217\'20\'19s place.\par \par \uc2 He\u8217\'20\'19s 19 and dropped out of university, saying the work was too hard.\par \par \uc2 He has a weekend job in a supermarket but what little he earns goes on cannabis.\par \par \uc2 We\u8217\'20\'19ve asked him to get a full-time job but he\u8217\'20\'19s just not interested.\par \par \uc2 My husband and I are at the end of our tether. What can we do to make him see sense?\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: I do feel for you \u8211\'20\'13 and him. He\u8217\'20\'19s probably feeling he\u8217\'20\'19s let everyone down by dropping out of uni, and drugs can seem like a prop when your self-esteem is at rock bottom.\par \par \uc2 Keep talking to him and emphasising how much you love and appreciate him, even though you hate his drug use.\par \par \uc2 Encourage him to talk to Frank National Drugs Helpline ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.talktofrank.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 talktofrank.com}}}\uc2 , 0300 123 66 00).\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m sending you my e-leaflet Looking For Work to give him some contacts and ideas.\par \par \uc2 Encourage him to start with some voluntary work to help him feel he has a worthwhile contribution to make, even if it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t bring in any income.\par \par \uc2 Dear Deidre\par \par \uc2 MY wife and I get our sexual timing all wrong. It is so frustrating for both of us.\par \par \uc2 We had an arranged marriage but are very happy with one another \u8211\'20\'13 except for our sex life.\par \par \uc2 I climax quickly but my wife takes far longer, so often isn\u8217\'20\'19t satisfied, which makes me feel ashamed.\par \par \uc2 How can I make her climax faster?\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: Trying to hurry her would just put pressure on you both and make things worse.\par \par \uc2 You can learn self-help tactics to delay your climax but more women orgasm through stimulation other than intercourse anyway.\par \par \uc2 Advice lines today Orgasm For Women (09067 577 162) and How Men Can Last Longer (09067 577 161) will help.\par \par \uc2 Teen troubles Dear Deidre\par \par \uc2 MY friend has been sending naked pics of herself to at least six different guys.

She doesn\u8217\'20\'19t care that all her friends know what she is doing.\par \par \uc2 Should I talk to our head of year or let her carry on?\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: Your friend may appear quite happy but deep down she is probably a very troubled girl. It is very likely something has happened or is happening to make her seek attention.\par \par \uc2 You should talk to your head of year. You could always open the topic without naming her \u8211\'20\'13 just say how worried you are for one of your friends, then ask what action the school would take.\par \par \uc2 You can find guidance through Get Connected, who help under 25s ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.getconnected.org.uk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 getconnected.org.uk}}}\uc2 , 0808 808 4994).\par \par \uc2 Dear Deidre\par \par \uc2 I WENT out with a girl twice and now she won\u8217\'20\'19t leave me alone.\par \par \uc2 I split up with my girlfriend of two years five months ago. I met a girl who is perfect for me in February.\par \par \uc2 Before that I went out briefly with a girl who was 17 like me. I could tell she was smitten so I backed off, as I wasn\u8217\'20\'19t really into her.\par \par \uc2 Since then she\u8217\'20\'19s bombarded me with texts and calls. She claimed she was pregnant, which was a lie.\par \par \uc2 Then I discovered her sister had tried to add my new girlfriend as a friend on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . I\u8217\'20\'19m terrified she\u8217\'20\'19s going to make up lies to get what she wants.\par \par \uc2 DEIDRE SAYS: Tell the other girl there is never going to be any you and her.\par \par \uc2 Say you are sorry but that is the way it is.\par \par \uc2 Then honesty is your best defence.

The Communities Secretary, no doubt aware of the perils of appearing to repeat Dave's "fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists" insult, made a point of absolving Ukip of the charge that it is a racist party. He's technically right: its policies are patently not concerned with either race or ethnicity. But he damned them nevertheless as xenophobic, uber-nationalist, and shameful on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . He said there were certainly racists in the party and some of its politicians used racism for political ends. they may not be racist, therefore, but for Mr Pickles they remain a fairly unpleasant outfit.\par \par \uc2 If you haven't had a chance to read it yet, he also dismisses the southern toffs charge against the Tories, claiming it's usually levelled by elite, lefty southern toffs. He says the tide is turning in the Tories' favour. He compares the anger of voters to that scene in Network (see above) when Peter Finch gets everyone to open their windows and shout "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore". He dismissers the Gove v Clegg row as an "unedifying scrap" and says special advisers should be reined in. And, at a time when Tories are muttering that the Coalition was a mistake and they want out, he is unashamed: he's proud of what it has achieved, not least saving the country from financial destruction.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140517ea5h002bj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw248\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3720\pichgoal600

Every time Nigel Farage opens his mouth, the combined political classes of Primrose Hill and Holland Park react like a chorus of flashed spinsters, exposed to the hairy buttocks of a drunken navvy. Oh my word, he\u8217\'20\'19s done it again! Someone stop him! Help!\par \par \uc2 But it\u8217\'20\'19s a funny thing, this metropolitan fainting fit induced by anything connected to Ukip. To me it seems overdone; to me it suggests there are deeper psychological forces at work. After all, Ukiphave yet to win a single MP at Westminster. So why do they invoke all these bladder-bursting conniptions in the chatterati?\par \par \uc2 Opinion formers would have it that Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s opinions are the problem; i.e. the party is a bunch of crypto-fascists, the BNP with polished brogues, a bus-load of \u8220\'20\'1Cloonies, fruitcakes and closet racists\u8221\'20\'1D (according to the PM). Therefore these barely concealed bigotries need to be exposed, by the scandalised elite, so the proles can react with proper aversion, and go back to dutifully voting Lib, Lab and Con.\par \par \uc2 But what are these appalling Kipper opinions, polices and personalities which so affront the Top Ten Thousand?\par \par \uc2 First, the people. There\u8217\'20\'19s no doubt that Ukipdoes attract a few crazies and extremists. But then, all political parties do that, indeed I\u8217\'20\'19d suggest that, for most citizens, the mere act of joining a political party \u8211\'20\'13 any party \u8211\'20\'13 is the act of a dubious nerd with narcissism issues, so Ukipare hardly unique. Furthermore, Ukip\u8211\'20\'13 as Farage ably put it \u8211\'20\'13 do not have a monopoly on oddballs. Or extremists.\par \par \uc2 Here, for instance, is a list of Labour Party notables who used to be communists or Marxist fellow-travellers: Alistair Darling. Jim Murphy, Jack Straw, Peter Hain, John Reid, Peter Mandelson. Now, whatever you think of Nigel Farage or Paul Nuttall, as far as I know they have not called for the overthrow of bourgeois democracy, so let\u8217\'20\'19s toss out that canard about Ukipbeing uniquely \u8220\'20\'1Cfull of extremists\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 How about their policies then? One Kipper position that Ukipphobes love to cite is their apparent desire to{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.paulnuttallmep.com/?p=1440"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 reintroduce the death penalty}}}\uc2 . And on the face of it that does seem quite \u8220\'20\'1Cout there\u8221\'20\'1D. No EU nation uses the death penalty (it is forbidden by quasi-EU law), virtually no western nations use the death penalty. So this policy is indeed a fringe position, right? Wrong. On the latest polls about 50 per cent of Britons support the death penalty.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/3802"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Half the country.}}}\uc2 And until Ukipcame along, the views of half the country, on this issue, were entirely unrepresented in mainstream politics.\par \par \uc2 Then what about Europe? You probably know what I\u8217\'20\'19m going to say here but it\u8217\'20\'19s worth saying anyway. All three mainstream parties are intent on remaining within the EU (after some pantomime renegotiation if you are a Tory). That means that the 30-50per cent of the country that{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-26892237"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 expressly wants to leave the EU}}}\uc2 has been wholly unrepresented in politics. Until the rise of Ukip.\par \par \uc2 Then what about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 ? Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s policy is to severely restrict \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . Again this seems pretty radical, until you look at the polls.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/12/17/perilous-politics-immigration/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 Sixty-nineper centof people}}}\uc2 actually wantzero net \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 . In other words, most Brits, when it comes to \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , are even further to the right than Ukip.\par \par \uc2 And so on, and so forth. Ukip are against HS2 (the only party with that position). So are{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/05/01/public-still-oppose-hs2/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 48per centof the British people.}}}\uc2 Ukip have considered a policy to ban the burqa (the only party to consider that position) \u8211\'20\'13 this is a policy supported by{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/09/18/most-still-want-ban-burka-britain/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 61per cent of British voters}}}\uc2 . Ukip want to cut foreign aid (the only party with that position) \u8211\'20\'13 this is a policy supported by{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2293620/Voters-want-cuts-overseas-aid-More-half-want-Chancellor-reduce-spending-ahead-Budget.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 55per centof the British people}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Now personally, I\u8217\'20\'19m not a Ukipsupporter, but I can damn well read Ukip\u8217\'20\'19s polling numbers. And what they tell me is that virtually all of these \u8220\'20\'1Ccranky\u8221\'20\'1D, \u8220\'20\'1Cfruitcake\u8221\'20\'1D, \u8220\'20\'1Cloonytoon\u8221\'20\'1D positions adopted by Ukipturn out to be opinions shared by large minorities, or outright majorities, of the British electorate. They are also opinions that have, until recently, been ignored and repressed by the liberal elite.\par \par \uc2 This then, is why the political classes are horrified by Ukip. It\u8217\'20\'19s not because they believe Ukip are really crazy. It\u8217\'20\'19s because they are worried Ukipmight be really popular.\par \par \uc2 Document TELUK00020140517ea5h002bi\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Politics\par \b \uc2 Brown's nemesis blasts Ed Miliband for being 'no different'\b0\par\par\uc2 By EMILY ASHTON, Whitehall Correspondent   \par \uc2 938 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 May 2014\par 11:33\par \uc2 thesun.co.uk\par \uc2 THESUK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 News Group Newspapers Ltd.

He said at some East London schools a majority of pupils did not speak English.\par \par \uc2 "Doesn't that say to us that what we want is a sensible balanced \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy?" He said he was trying to make the "simple point" that being in the EU made that impossible. "What is racism? Is race about race or is it about nationality? I made a comment that wasn't intended to say any more than that I felt uncomfortable about the rate and pace of change."\par \par \uc2 Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  called Mr Farage's words "the politics of anger".

I've been in the business for five years and I've never come across something like this and I would not allow it. It is wrong and ridiculous."\par \par \uc2 MPs and campaigners warned the scandal could be part of a wider operation to provide passports to \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2 , at a time when 200,000 a year are being handed out.\par \par \uc2 The language exam must be passed alongside a separate Life in the UK test, which measures candidates on their knowledge of British law.\par \par \uc2 Document THEEXP0020140517ea5h0000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Ed Miliband's new election guru has told Labour campaign chiefs to sharpen up, get organised and to exploit \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 's critical weaknesses in marginal seats.\par \par \uc2 David Axelrod, the US strategist who helped to put Barack Obama in the White House, urged key figures to get a stronger grip in the face of a well-funded, well-oiled Tory machine.\par \par \uc2 Senior Labour figures saw Mr Axelrod's intervention as a call to get their act together and halt simmering internal tensions that have plagued Labour's election campaign effort to date.\par \par \uc2 One source who heard Mr Axelrod speak said that he told the party: "Your messages are good, your policies good, your politics is good. But the other side are extremely well-organised. That's where you can close the gap."\par \par \uc2 After a two-day visit to London this week, Mr Axelrod tweeted in praise of the party \u8212\'20\'14 but misspelt Mr Miliband's name and linked to a spoof \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account.\par \par \uc2 "Enjoyed my visit with @Ed_Milliband and his @UKLABOUR team," he wrote. Mr Miliband downplayed the error as part of the "perils of tweeting" and said that the two men shared a mission to tackle a "disconnect" between economic growth and living standards.\par \par \uc2 Labour are reeling from a miserable week that saw them briefly overtaken by the Conservatives in the polls. Insiders said that they had even mused in advance of the visit about how much of "the ugly stuff" in Labour they should let Mr Axelrod see.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Mr Miliband made a major policy announcement on guaranteed GP appointments, only for the party to send out a leaflet on Tuesday failing to mention the new idea. Earlier promises that the campaign would highlight the party's promise to introduce a form of rent control never materialised, amid disquiet about a party political broadcast attacking Nick Clegg as the "the Un-credible Shrinking Man".\par \par \uc2 Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, distanced himself from a campaign poster on the coalition's VAT increase on Wednesday, while on Thursday Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, wrote an article suggesting that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  should have played a more prominent role in the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr Miliband appeared to be responding to the criticism that he has not said enough on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  yesterday, when he suggested that Labour David Axelrod told months, and that \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  to the UK could be cut without leaving the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr Miliband also said that Mr Axelrod had concentrated on the "defining question" of "growing inequality" in his talks with Labour campaign chiefs. "This is what he has been saying to us this week. I will let you into the secret," he told the BBC.\par \par \uc2 A senior Labour figure said that the strategist would want to run through the issues that the party was polling, and how it was conducting its focus group research, as well as examining Mr Miliband's campaign team.\par \par \uc2 "He'll want to make sure whether there's someone with proper sign-off powers during the campaign," the source said.\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140517ea5h000m7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 Nigel Farage's spin doctor attempted to halt a live radio interview yesterday as the Ukip leader struggled to cope with tough questions about his expenses and his views on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In a gaffe-filled encounter with the radio host James O'Brien on the London station LBC, Mr Farage was accused of "demonising" Romanian \b \uc2 immigrants\b0 \uc2  and appeared to suggest that he expected his wife to speak German only in private.\par \par \uc2 He was also embarrassed when questioned about Ukip's associations with a far-right Italian MEP who had defended the extremist ideas of the Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Breivik. David Cameron later described Mr Farage's comments as the "politics of anger".\par \par \uc2 Twenty minutes into the interview, Mr Farage, who became increasingly agitated, was asked why he had backed out of a pledge to allow an audit of his use of EU allowances following allegations published by The Times that he had misused almost \u163\'00\'A360,000 in office expenses.\par \par \uc2 Patrick O'Flynn, the party's director of communications and a former Daily Express journalist, interrupted to say: "Sorry, we had an agreement about timing, you've massively ..." before the Ukip leader waved him away.\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage insisted that he had spent his allowances within the rules but would not allow his accounts to be audited in the same way as Labour MEPs. He said he was "very suspicious of the word audit used in that context".\par \par \uc2 Mr Cameron attacked Mr Farage in a television interview, saying he sent out "a terrible message about Britain".\par \par \uc2 "I just hope people will recognise that we are an open, tolerant, compassionate country," the prime minister said. "Yes, we want to have a controlled \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system, yes, we want to sort out the welfare system, but we shouldn't put these labels on as Ukip do."\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage, whose wife is German, was asked about previous comments in which he said he felt uncomfortable when travelling on a train and not hearing English spoken.\par \par \uc2 O'Brien said: "You felt uncomfortable about people speaking foreign languages, despite the fact presumably your own wife does when she phones home to Germany."\par \par \uc2 "I don't suppose she speaks it on the train, you know. That's the point I'm making," Mr Farage replied. O'Brien also questioned Mr Farage about comments that he would be "concerned" if he had Romanian neighbours. Mr Farage said he stood by the remarks, pointing to "eye-watering" statistics for crimes committed by Romanians and raising concerns about trafficking. Asked why Romanians moving in next door would be any different from German children, the Ukip leader replied: "You know what the difference is."\par \par \uc2 He added: "We want an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  system based on controlling not only quantity but quality as well."\par \par \uc2 O'Brien asked Mr Farage why he co-chaired the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group in the European parliament with Francesco Speroni, who has reportedly said that Breivik's ideas "were in defence of western civilisation". The Ukip leader mistakenly claimed that Mr Speroni had been kicked out of the group before being informed that he was referring to a different politician.\par \par \uc2 Mr O'Flynn, who is likely to be elected as an MEP next week, later said he had interrupted the interview because it was supposed to last only 15 minutes and Mr Farage had to be somewhere else.\par \par \uc2 Eric Pickles, the secretary of state for communities and local government, told The Daily Telegraph that Mr Farage was "shameful" for playing on people's fears about \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140517ea5h000eo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

All rights reserved   \par \par \uc2 A decision by Britain to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  would be a risky gamble that could result in economic losses larger than those suffered at the time of the global financial crisis, a group of influential economists has warned.\par \par \uc2 In fresh analysis of the effects of a so-called Brexit, the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) said that in the worst-case scenario Britain could suffer a fall of between 6.3 per cent and 9.5 per cent of GDP because of increased trade and regulatory costs. This compares with a 7 per cent drop in output after the global financial crisis struck.\par \par \uc2 In the most optimistic case, it would result in a 2.2 per cent fall in GDP. There would also be further effects on \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2 , foreign investment and regulations, according to the CEP, which is part of the London School of Economics.\par \par \uc2 Britain received the most foreign direct investment of any European country in 2011. Part of the country's attraction is as an export platform to the rest of the EU so, if the UK were outside the trading bloc, this position would likely be threatened, the economists added.\par \par \uc2 More than half of all British exports go to the rest of the EU, the equivalent of nearly 15 per cent of GDP. There were promising signs of life in the latest set of trade numbers. Exports of goods to countries within the EU increased by \u163\'00\'A3700 million to \u163\'00\'A312.3 billion, according to the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Given that the \uc2 UK government\uc2  is trying to rebalance the economy towards export-based growth, the 15 per cent of GDP destined for the EU is a significant share," the report said.\par \par \uc2 "Losses due to trade alone could be very substantial. Even under very optimistic assumptions, the sum of the static and dynamic trade losses would be almost 2.2 per cent of GDP. More pessimistic calculations would lead to a long-term loss of almost a tenth of national income. The dream of splendid isolation may turn out to be a very costly one indeed."\par \par \uc2 Document T000000020140517ea5h0006q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600

And if you lived in London, I think you would be." He went on to declare: "We want an \b \uc2 immigration\b0 \uc2  policy based on controlling not just quantity, but quality as well."\par \par \uc2 And he claimed the Metropolitan Police have produced "eye-watering" crime statistics on Romanians.\par \par \uc2 His remarks came during tetchy exchanges with presenter James O'Brien on LBC radio yesterday.\par \par \uc2 At one point, O'Brien said: "And what about the line about not wanting to live next door to Romanians. It's perfectly acceptable for people not to want to\u8230\'20\'26" Farage: I didn't say that. I was asked, if a group of Romanian men moved in next door to you, would you be concerned. O'Brien: What about if a group of German children did? What's the difference? Farage: You know what the difference is.\par \par \uc2 O'Brien: No I honestly don't. In the car crash radio interview, Farage insisted his party did not like to be linked to the Far Right.\par \par \uc2 Languages And he defended previous comments that it was uncomfortable to hear so many foreign languages on the \uc2 London Underground\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr Farage also said he had no problem with his German wife or kids speaking German \u8212\'20\'14 as they also speak English.\par \par \uc2 Last night Romanian Cultural Centre chief Nicolae Ratiu said his countrymen coming to London would be "horrified" to hear Ukip's views. He told The Sun: "It's the most racist comment he could possibly make."\par \par \uc2 Last week, Mr Farage attacked the political class and the media for reporting "stupid or offensive" comments by Ukip candidates.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, it emerged Gloucestershire council candidate John Lyndon Sullivan had once asked on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  what would happen "if we shot a poofter. Would the rest turn straight?" Challenged about the comments, Mr Farage said: "People say silly things." He then added: "I haven't heard of him."\par \par \uc2 Last night PM David Cameron said some of Mr Farage's remarks were "pretty unpleasant".\par \par \uc2 steve.hawkes@the-sun.co.uk\par \par \uc2 Document THESUN0020140517ea5h000gm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw121\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1815\pichgoal600
